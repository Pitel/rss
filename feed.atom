Aspyr's Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection hasn't got off to the best start, with all sorts of "critical errors" taking place with the network infrastructure at launch. To add to this, there are various other reports and problems.
Now, after all the feedback, the developer has revealed its first update for the game, which will arrive on the Switch and multiple other console platforms as soon as the submission and certification process is completed.

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is arguably the most anticipated release on Nintendo's calendar in 2024, and just months out from the title's launch, it seems all this enthusiasm has led to the updated version completely selling out on Amazon in the US.
In addition to The Thousand-Year Door selling out on Amazon, the game has also (unsurprisingly) topped Amazon's best-sellers list - placing it ahead of new and upcoming releases like Dragon's Dogma 2 and Monster Hunter Stories Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smoking fish in Stardew Valley has multiple benefits, from feeding hungry raccoons to eating for increased energy and health. However, unlocking this feature requires buying a specific crafting recipe and obtaining some challenging items before diving into cooking mechanics. Here's how to smoke fish in Stardew Valley.


How to smoke fish in Stardew Valley


Smoking fish in Stardew Valley requires purchasing the fish smoker recipe from Willy's shop for 10,000 gold and crafting it using hardwood and three jelly types. Once you create your fish smoker, you can toss any fish into it to turn it into its smoked variant, allowing you to feed the Big Tree raccoons or eat the fish to restore energy.


How to buy and craft the fish smoker in Stardew Valley


The first step to smoking fish is buying the fish smoker recipe from Willy's shop for 10,000 gold. Willy's shop is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. in-game time, with Willy appearing at the register at 9 a.m.

Once you purchase the recipe, you'll need the following items to craft the smoker:



Hardwood (10)


Sea Jelly (1)


River Jelly (1)


Cave Jelly (1)



While you can easily find hardwood in the Secret Forest and on your farm, the three jelly types are difficult to obtain. All three jellies require you to fish, each located at the beach, river, and caves, respectively. Once you get every item, craft the smoker and use a fish alongside some coal before waiting for them to finish cooking. Much like using a furnace, it isn't an immediate process, making this a good time to do other things before returning to grab your food. Eventually, the fish will finish smoking, allowing you to give it to the raccoons, keep it, or sell it for extra money.

Plunderstorm is essentially a fast-paced pirate-themed battle royale mode. However, there's not really any instruction on how to play Plunderstorm in World of Warcraft. Here's how to jump into the battle royale mode and play right away.

How to queue for the new Plunderstorm game mode


In order to play Plunderstorm in World of Warcraft, you need to actually enter it from the character selection screen. If you are already logged in, you need to log out to the character select screen. Once you're at the screen where you normally choose a character or realm to log in to, you need to look in the top left corner. Alongside the World of Warcraft: Dragonflight logo you will actually see a completely separate logo for Plunderstorm. Click this logo and it will switch to the Plunderstorm queue instead of the default character login queue.


Once you're on this new Plunderstorm screen you can click Customize Character to customize the pirate character you will be playing Plunderstorm as. When you are ready to play, just click Join Game and you will enter the queue to play Plunderstorm!


The only requirement to play Plunderstorm is having an active World of Warcraft account with active game time, either for retail WoW or WoW Classic. You do not need to have the World of Warcraft: Dragonflight expansion, but you do need to have the Dragonflightretail client downloaded and installed to play Plunderstorm.


You can choose to queue solo or with a friend in duos. All progress on the Plunderstorm Keg Leg Crew renown track is account-wide, so you can customize your character at any time without fear of having to restart progression on the track.


That's how to play the new Plunderstorm battle royale mode in World of Warcraft. It's actually a fun mode, so be sure to give it a shot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moss is a helpful resource in Stardew Valley for making items like the deluxe worm bin and mushroom log. However, it is initially challenging to spot, so you'll need to get your hands on this material before you can make them. Here's how to get moss in Stardew Valley.


Where to find moss in Stardew Valley


You can find moss on trees during any season other than Winter. However, only trees with a green mossy texture along their trunks have moss on them. Once you spot a mossy tree, hit it with an axe to get one to two moss out of it.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Mossy trees commonly spawn around the map, including in Cindersap and the Secret Forest. As you travel around Pelican Town, the quarry and various forests, you'll spot these trees everywhere, allowing you to farm moss quickly. 


How to use moss in Stardew Valley


You'll use moss in multiple crafting recipes, including the deluxe worm bin and mushroom log. Creating the deluxe worm bin requires a regular version of this machine and 30 moss, and it allows you to get better bait for fishing. The mushroom log also needs moss alongside ten hardwood to make, allowing you to obtain mushrooms occasionally. Placing one near wild trees will make it more effective, so crafting some and putting them in tree-filled areas is worth crafting.


You can also use it to cook moss soup. One bowl of moss soup requires 20 moss, making it slightly expensive when you're just starting. Although the soup doesn't give any status effects, it restores 70 energy and 31 health, making it useful for cave exploration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley's Big Tree has a neighbor you can meet once you complete its prerequisite requirements. However, before doing this, you'll have to find the tree, farm an uncommon resource, and build the neighbor's home. Here's how to find the Big Tree in Stardew Valley.


Where to find the Big Tree in Stardew Valley


The Big Tree is in Cindersap Forest, the region south of your farm, just before the entrance to the Secret Forest. Once you go south from your farm to the forest, you'll spot it to your left inside the fenced-in area.


However, you can't do anything with its initial tree form. Instead, you can only interact with the Big Tree after encountering the "strong wind storm" event at night, after falling asleep. This night event causes the tree to fall and produce a large stump. You'll know it's ready when you find a question mark icon on the stump, indicating you can start its quest line. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Once you interact with the stump following the strong winds dialogue, you'll gain "The Giant Stump" quest, which asks you to get 100 hardwood. You can get hardwood around your farm and in the Secret Forest. Since you need 100, you may need a few in-game days to gather enough. Fortunately, there isn't a time limit for completing this, so you can collect the hardwood at your own pace. 


After gathering the wood and returning to the Big Tree's stump, you'll build a house on top and wait for someone to move in. After some time, you'll have a new neighbor to interact with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Books in Stardew Valley are a fantastic resource for increasing skill EXP and gaining permanent character buffs. However, finding them requires digging artifact spots for books or purchasing them from a bookseller. Here's how to find a bookseller in Stardew Valley.


Where is the Bookseller in Stardew Valley?


The bookseller is an NPC in Stardew Valley located on the northeast side of town, just north of the museum and JojaMart. Upon reaching JojaMart, you'll find a stairway leading directly to the bookseller. However, you can only access this vendor on days when the bookseller is visiting town, which you can check by looking for a notification in the bottom-left side of your screen or by checking your calendar for a blue hot air balloon icon.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Once you find the bookseller, you can purchase or trade in books. Buying books allows you to pay a one-time flat gold fee, ranging from a few thousand to over 25,000 gold. Although it's a hefty fee, the skill and perk benefits often outweigh this. Alternatively, you can trade in books in exchange for items. The items you use to exchange books include cooked dishes, rare items for valuable books, and materials like wood, coal, and bait for skill books.


The book options change each time the bookseller visits, with duplicates having a thumbs-up icon to avoid you buying them twice. The exception to this is skill books, which you can read repeatedly for multiple EXP boosts. If you read a skill book but have a maxed-out skill, you'll gain mastery points instead. In other words, you'll have to revisit the bookseller multiple times to get mastery quickly or unlock every book perk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Stardew Valley 1.6, the patch notes have been revealed, and it’s safe to say that Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone has been one very busy man over the last few months. There’s a very, very long list of changes and additions to the game, so let’s take a look.


Rather than going into absolutely everything, I’m going to focus on the most important aspect of 1.6 - the new features, items, and content we get to enjoy. For everything else, you can check the patch notes themselves and read them at your leisure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley 1.6 introduced four new crops that, unlike most seeds, are not purchasable through Pierre's General Store. Each item is available in different seasons, with Powdermelon being an exclusive winter crop. Here's how to find Powdermelon in Stardew Valley.


Where to find Powdermelon seeds in Stardew Valley


In Stardew Valley, you can find Powdermelon seeds by digging grass tufts and artifact spots during Winter. Artifact spots drop artifacts and seeds, while grass spots have a much higher chance of giving seeds. These grass spots look similar to artifact dig spots, except they appear as grass flowing in the wind. You can dig both with a hoe to get one to two seeds.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Artifact spots look like worms poking out of the ground, while grass tufts look like grass blowing in the wind. They appear randomly around the map, dropping one of the four new seed types. The grass spots pictured above both dropped Powdermelon seeds, while another grass tuft north of my farm that I found on the same day had a carrot seed. 


Once you have your Powdermelon seeds, you can grow them after planting and watering the crop for seven in-game days during Winter. After seven days, they'll mature, allowing you to harvest them. Like most crops in Stardew Valley, you can use Powdermelon in a seed maker to produce more seeds, giving you a renewable way to get additional melons without running back to the forest or the wild. Alternatively, you can sell them for a base value of 60 gold, with farming level buffs and quality increasing this further.

The PS2 was home to a library of classics we still can't seem to stop remastering or porting, and while the PS3 certainly delivered later in its life, it wasn't until the PlayStation 4 that we saw a more consistent life cycle of irrefutable classics.


The PS4 marked the return of the PlayStation in full force and, with it, one of the best video game catalogs in the history of Sony's systems. If you're a little late to the party, or just want to make sure you've hit the highlights, I've got a list rolling covering some of the best PS4 games you should play.

        <updated>2024-03-19T17:16:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[30 years ago, Success's shoot 'em up series Cotton made the leap from 2D side-scroller to Space Harrier-style rail shooter in Panorama Cotton. 24 years ago, Rainbow Cotton expanded upon that 3D flight of fancy on Dreamcast, and now it's finally making its way to the West. 


While Rainbow Cotton launched in Japan only on Dreamcast back in 2000, ININ Games recently announced plans to bring a remake to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Those spring 2024 plans were just narrowed down to a specific launch date of May 9, and ININ put together something special for the accompanying trailer. Rather than simply showing off Rainbow Cotton in all its updated glory, the new trailer serves up a brief guide to how the team brings retro games to modern audiences. 




There tends to be a lot of discussion about where the line is between remaster and remake, and the video above does a good job of succinctly summing it up, at least in terms of how ININ Games handles it. They get into where emulation and ports fall in the mix of the Cotton re-releases, and why Rainbow Cotton deserves the distinction of a full remake.


The remake features upgraded graphics in full HD, updates to the user interface, lock-on targeting, a two-player mode. and other bells and whistles. Those who just want to play the original as it appeared on Dreamcast can do that, as well. ININ calls it "as authentic as it can possibly be," so you'll just have to imagine you have your VMU plugged into your modern platform of choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zeb-easily the best.
Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, to celebrate Super Metroid's 30th anniversary, Ollie sings the praises of the game's enduring foreboding atmosphere...

The Metroid series is perhaps best known for its wonderful atmosphere and keen sense of isolation. In addition to its consistently strong structure, interconnected locations, and formidable antagonists, its oppressive yet irresistibly intriguing atmosphere is one of the reasons why the games gained such a loyal following, and why it continues to become more successful as time goes on (albeit more slowly compared to other Nintendo franchises).

This new industry obsession is still taking shape, and there are lots of questions still to be answered about how much it might cost in the future, who will have access to it, and what it will actually help with, not to mention fears about job losses and other harms. But there’s a bigger question bubbling underneath all of this that threatens to burst the wobbly generative AI bubble: is the entire boom built on stolen labour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a "massive and deeply engrossing action RPG," so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here's the rest of the line-up:
What's Coming To Game Pass This Month
Lightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today
MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today

Plunderstorm will drop 60 pirates onto the Arathi Highlands to fight monsters, loot chests, level up, acquire abilities, and beat the hell out of each other as a storm closes in. It's initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

To demonstrate this, ININ has released a debut trailer to make sure you're clued up on the definitions of emulation, remaster, and remake. It's always nice to get a reminder, eh?

Nintendo's Princess Peach: Showtime! is just around the corner, launching on the Switch on 22nd March, 2024.
While our own review isn't too far off, the folks over at Famitsu have posted their thoughts on the upcoming action-adventure (thanks, Gematsu and Ryokutya2089). The good news is that it seems to have proven a hit with critics, though it doesn't reach the heights of some of Nintendo's most prestigious Switch games, gaining a total score of 33/40. The split for this one is relatively even at 8 / 8 / 9 / 8.

As the name implies, it's a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload's founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they're viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. "The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward," Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. "We're not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining." Rather, it's "more of a reimagining" of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons & Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

FFXIV Patch 6.58 doesn't have a lengthy list of notes, but what the patch lacks in size, it makes up for in importance. There's noteworthy changes to the Duty Finder / Raid Finder, adjustments to best-in-slot gear rewards, a new Crystaline Conflict season, and even a Wondrous Tails buff. 


Weapon augmentation upgrades and mount-hunting get easier

In this sequel to 2016's alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio's last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed's review, "has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels". Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It's so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake.

The 1.6 Patch is now live, and it's a doozy. If you want to read the patch notes in their entirety, which includes new content, balance updates, visual improvements, and more, you can do that right here.
The original story continues below...
Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you're marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it's a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

In particular, Resident Evil 4 (2023), has 2,133 mods available via Nexus Mods at the time of this writing. While it's fun to do things like replace character models, turn De Lago into Kyogre, and make yourself invincible, I've found a series of mods when, whose power combined, turns Resident Evil 4 into a Mario title.


How one modder made Resident Evil 4 better


A modder going by the handle of SupremeLeader777 has single-handily crafted the bulk of this batch of mods and is responsible for another Destructoid favorite, the Harbor Seal Ada Wong. I don't know who they are, but they have my undying love for the work they've done with not only Resident Evil 4, but the Resident Evil series as a whole…]]></summary>

Dark Souls: Archthrones is, essentially, a total conversion mod for Dark Souls 3 that takes up the monumental task of restructuring and retelling the core narrative of the franchise. Archthrones does come with its own lore, of course, which is "informed by the deepest secrets of the Dark Souls mythos," and allows the mod team to introduce new gear, enemies, and other assorted content. Yet, its central conceit is that it's trying hard to stay true to From Software's original work, all the while leveraging the stellar leve…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.]]></summary>

Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's always room for one more good one.
About five years ago, solo developer Evan Tor set out to make a new game in the crowded Metroidvania genre called Rebel Transmute. Tor launched a Kickstarter in 2022 to secure the funding to get the game over the line, and after a successful campaign and development period, the title has finally made it to consoles and PC. Rebel Transmute may not be a particularly innovative new entry in the genre, but what it lacks in novel ideas it more than makes up for in polish and quality. Rebel Transmute is great comfort food for the dedicated Metroidvania fan, and we’d suggest you pay attention to it.
Rebel Transmute places you in the role of Moon Mikono, a “space scrapper” in search of her mother who’s gone missing in action. Her search brings her to the isolated planet of Terra 6, which was once home to an extensive research facility helmed by the mysterious Foray corporation that her mother worked for. An EMP causes Moon’s ship to crash on Terra 6, and she wakes up twelve years later in a hostile and decrepit environment where something has since clearly gone wrong. Moon’s mother appears to be alive and somewhere on the planet, so our unlikely heroine sets out on a journey to find her and figure out what happened to the facility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that Helldivers 2 has enjoyed a large amount of success since it was released in February. In fact, it ended up knocking Steam Deck off the top place on Steam, something that doesn't happen too often. However, Valve's handheld PC has, once again, reclaimed its title.


As of right now, the Deck is back at the number one spot on the Top Sellers list, pushing Arrowhead Games' shooter down to number two. According to the data, Helldivers 2 has been on the list for nine weeks, though a good chunk of that time has been spent looking down atop its gaming ivory tower.




Quite why the Steam Deck has managed to climb its way back up can't be certain, but maybe it'll lose its place when Arrowhead releases another update or something. The way things have been these past few weeks suggests it's been a bit of a bout between software and hardware.


Deck the hells (yep, that's clever)


Just yesterday, Steam announced the launch of Steam Families, a new feature on the platform that "introduces significant updates and improvements to family sharing, parental controls, and child purchase requests." That could sort of explain why Deck has suddenly taken the lead again.


Looking at the Top Seller's list in general, there are some perhaps-not-too-surprising resurgences at the moment. At the time of writing, Dead by Daylight has risen 23 places to take the number five spot, while Cyberpunk 2077 has climbed a pretty impressive 44 places this week, sitting comfortably at number eight.


Of course, the fact that these specific games are on sale can account for their sudden rise in popularity. Doesn't take a huge amount of brain power to conclude that things suddenly become more appealing when they're a bit cheaper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big Mode, the video game publisher established by content creator Videogamedunkey, has finally revealed the official release date for what feels like its most-anticipated game: Animal Well. 


Big Mode announced the title as its flagship game last year, and now we know it'll be available for fans to get their hands on in just a couple of months. 


When is the release date for Animal Well?




Animal Well will released on May 9, 2024, for PC via Steam, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. We've received confirmation that the game will be completely Steam Deck compatible on day one, which is a huge relief. I love playing games like this on the Steam Deck, even if it is the base model and not the OLED one. The system feels made to be a home for interesting Metroidvanias with unique twists and mechanics…]]></summary>

As per Valve's own blog post, Steam Families is about to replace the aging Family Sharing feature for good. Not immediately, mind, as Families is currently only available via the Beta version of Steam, but the full replacement is on its way. 


Steam Families is a combination of both Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View systems with a bunch of other goodies thrown in for good measure. With support for up to 6 family members total, anyone using Families will be able to share their games m…]]></summary>

This isn't a wholly new development, of course. As Dying Light 2 is slowly morphing into its predecessor to some extent, it has overtaken the original game's post-launch roadmap with gusto. We now have ample cosmetics, microtransaction options, and features such as guns (which originally had no place in Dying Light 2) to choose from, but Smektała says Techland won't nudge the game further on that front: "We’ve settled on a very unique formula with the original Dying Light – premium game with additional GaaS elements – a…]]></summary>

If you cast your mind back to the April 2023 Indie World showcase, you might remember the reveal of Animal Well — a pretty but punishing pixel art platformer being published by YouTubers videogamedunkey and Leahbee's Bigmode. Well, that very game has now got a release date, and it's coming to Switch on 9th May.
Animal Well is one of those games that brings vibes by the bucketload. You play as a little blob, making your way through a gorgeous pixel art labyrinth and collecting items to help you along your way. The only catch is that this labyrinth is filled with animals. And a lot of them are going to want to eat you.

Clearly, it was also a question on the minds on Japanese indie developers ThinkGames Inc, who have just announced their debut game Valiant Tactics EX. The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that's not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn't just an anime Total War-like. It's also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

We love a good retro-style puzzler here at Nintendo Life, and the upcoming Isles of Sea and Sky looks like it could be a doozy. The only downside right now is that it's not confirmed for the Switch.. yet.
With a release on Steam coming at some point in 2024, developer Cicada Games has a console release in its sights, stating "We are interested in launching on other platforms including the Nintendo Switch" in the official press kit. We certainly hope it does make its way to the Switch, because it looks like a lovely litle puzzler in which you explore an open world and complete a variety of puzzles in whichever order you see fit.

One common response to the arrival of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on the Switch was to wait until a sale. And now, just months after its release, this slick and stylish "must-play" has received a 40% price cut on the eShop in the US and Canada.
As highlighted by Nintendo of America, this reduces the digital price of the 2.5D platformer from $49.99 to just $29.99. You can also save some money on the digital deluxe edition (featuring some in-game content and more), which is now $35.99 instead of $59.99. This sale runs until 1st April.

I may be doing this out of respect, or, perhaps, as an attempt to get something for me in the will — you will never find out.


What you may have already found out, however, is that many have complained that the life of the PS5 seems to parallel the early years of the PS3, with a sore lack of games. I don't think that's a fair comparison. The PS5 went through some serious issues during its first years and still launched a rich and well-rounded library of titles. Let's look at my favs of the bunch.

The, frankly genius, Sound Director and Composer Masayoshi Soken is someone who I have endless respect and praise for, but we'll get into the reasons why later. Until then, in the spirit of celebrating Soken and the FFXIV sound team's work, I'm narrowing down a list of favorites.


As we await a new era of bangers in Dawntrail, let’s look at my personal top 10 picks from the MMO's OSTs thus far, but please remember that this list is not exhaustive by any means, and I had an extremely hard time whittling down my choices to such a small sampling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight is currently undergoing a massive event called the Blood Moon. As part of the event you can earn daily login rewards, partake in exclusive event-oriented game modes, and more.  But when does the Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event end? Here's what we know.




Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event end date


The Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event ends on March 31, 2024. The event started on March 18, 2024, meaning it will last for almost two weeks in total. Even though Blood-related events are common in Dead by Daylight, this is the first ever actual Blood Moon event, so there's no telling if it will return.


What should you do before Blood Moon event ends


There are several event-specific rewards that are only obtainable during the Blood Moon event, so you should try to get them before the event ends. The Blood Moon event rewards are:



Elodie Rakoto — Catacomb Exploration outfit


The Oni — Red Mist outfit


Universal Charm: Blood Basin


Universal Charm: Dripping Skulls


Universal Badge: Blood Basin


Universal Banner: Bubbling Blood


Universal Banner: Blood Web



As you complete event-specific challenges on the codex you will receive Thrombotic Trinkets. You can then use these Thrombotic Trinkets to acquire all the above rewards, which you should do before the event ends. Once the event ends you will not be able to acquire anymore Thrombotic Trinkets and obtain the limited-time rewards.


There are also four Event-specific store items that are only purchasable during the event which are:



Ace Visconti — Gambler's Rush outfit


Mikaela Reid — Blood Magic outfit


The Doctor — Blood Shock outfit


The Skull Merchant — Scarlet Vengeance outfit



If there are any rewards that you are interested in, make sure you grab them before March 31, 2024 when the Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event ends.

Despite Duke Nukem 3D being what made the Build Engine famous, it wasn’t the first game released on it. There were a few that came before it, and Capstone was responsible for more than one of them.


Capstone Software is a kusoge topic in itself, as much of their catalog is either crap or sub-crap. While researching DOS games to cover in this column, many of their games rose to the top thanks to the preservation efforts of SNEG. However, a good many of Capstone’s worst games were based on terrible licenses, so they are no longer available. One of these unavailable titles …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has announced Steam Families, a revamped program that allows players to create a group to share and play games with close family members. The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member's library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last in a week-long series of Stardew Valley 1.6 sneak peeks have arrived, and ConcernedApe certainly knows how to save the best until the last. This time, he’s confirmed the addition of a new farm type, to the surprise of no one, but it now has a name — Meadowlands Farm. 


If nothing else will convince you to begin a new save file to enjoy everything 1.6 offers, perhaps a new farm type with blue grass and beloved by animals will. 




According to the small image that ConcernedApe shared, Meadowlands Farm comes complete with ‘chewy blue grass that animals love’, leaving some in the comments to speculate whether this means produce quality increases will be accelerated due to happier animals. 


Perhaps more excitingly, Meadowlands Farm will come with a coop and two Chickens from the offset, meaning you can immediately begin caring for them in order to get their eggs. Perhaps this goes hand-in-hand with yesterday’s update about drinking Mayonnaise, but I don’t want to think about that. 


Stardew Valley 1.6 is set to be released tomorrow, March 19, so this is likely to be the last teaser we get from ConcernedApe before we can all play ourselves. With that said, here’s everything we know about 1.6 ahead of its release:



Fruit Trees will yield Saplings of the same fruit


Harvesting will be at the same speed in either direction


Larger area of effect for downward Melee attacks


Moving past pets will now take less time


Spouses will now have a seven day ‘Honeymoon Period’ in the week after the wedding


Jelly, Pickles, Wines and Juices will now reflect the color of their main ingredient


We will be able to drink Mayonnaise

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.

It helps that I'm hunting Bigfoot. Hefting my magical bow, I peer around a tree trunk at the creature as he wanders down a slope of vivid orange grass sprinkled with pale blue rock. I only have a couple of arrows in my quiver, which doesn't feel like nearly enough, so I edge across the hillside to another tree trunk, where I can hopefully line up a headshot.

        <id>122184</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/GameGauntlet2024"/>
        <updated>2024-03-18T17:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

Update: Oops! Nintendo has since removed the previous music video and instead replaced it with a new one, Color Pulse '24, an updated version of Off the Hook's original song.
It seems like We're So Back is another tune that we'll be hearing later on down the line, but Nintendo uploaded it early by mistake. A number of prominent Splatoon leakers and players noticed the error on Twitter earlier.

Why are people angry that this character has seven fingers? Why does Nvidia want me to talk to a robot about ramen? Why is everyone saying AI is smart when it still can’t manage its Classical Era luxury resource economy in Civilization properly? In this new series, we’re going to explore what 'generative AI' is, why it’s arrived now in the games industry, and what it might mean for people who make, write about and play games in the future.

Jonathan Nolan, the creator of the upcoming Fallout TV series for Amazon Prime Video, seems to understand that.

Remember when Marvel's Midnight Suns was coming to Switch? Us neither. The game was announced as "no longer planned" for the Nintendo hybrid in May of last year, but now a new hero has risen to fill the void in the superhero turn-based realm.
Capes will be soaring onto Switch this May, and while it might not pack in quite as many recognisable faces as the aforementioned 2K project (there's no Spidey or Wolverine to be seen here) it's nice to see that the Switch is at least included in this superhero team-up.

We are now in the final run of Wii U and 3DS online play. Nintendo has confirmed that the consoles' online features and functionality will no longer work from 8th April 2024, and with that will come the end of a lot of game modes.
One title that will see some pretty heavy cuts is Super Mario Maker. The end of online play means that all community-built levels will soon be unplayable and the chance of 100% completion will be gone. It's a heart-breaking thought, but one that the community — specifically, a trained task force dubbed 'Team 0%' — has quickly rallied towards to make sure that no level is left unbeaten.

        <updated>2024-03-18T13:22:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey's Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world," Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). "I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say." 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

In it, you'll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it's unclear both what you are, and why exactly you're so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

Despite Ocarina of Time's brilliance, there is a boatload of frustrations to find in the polygonal plains of Hyrule. Pesky Kokiri get in your way, paths are barred by gates or tombstones, NPCs watch your every move. You could solve the necessary puzzles to move on, but wouldn't it be easier to, we don't know, Falcon Punch any difficulties into oblivion?
notCHase's mod does just that. Rather than swanning around Hyrule brandishing the Hookshot or Bomb Bag, this Link has everything he needs in one Smash Bros.-inspired, super-powered fist. Mido blocking your way? Falcon Punch. Hyrule Guard mocking your age? Falcon Punch. Sleepy Talon hindering your box-pushing exploits? Falcon Punch. It might not be the most thought-out solution, but it's a solution nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it's due out in "early 2025" as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today's, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game's new "REV" system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we'll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn't reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK's original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year. 
After that, catch up on Game Informer's thoughts on the latest fighting game releases:

It's been a long time coming, but the Fatal Fury franchise is officially back with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, a new fighting game from SNK that will be launching early 2025.
There's no word on target platforms for the game yet, and truth be told, we personally think it's a possibility that it might skip the Switch entirely for Nintendo's eventual successor. That said, with the entry built on Unreal Engine 4, it's entirely possible that it could be optimised sufficiently for the Switch.

Orange – HR

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn't feel much like conflict at all. It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

Ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it's narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses "The Hero" of Dragon's Dogma 2, the "Two Nations," and, of course, "The Monsters" that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 
Check it out for yourself in the Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below: 


Dragon's Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on Dragon's Dogma 2 preview, and then check out this story about how Dragon's Dogma 2's main story campaign is about the same length as the first game. After that, read about how Dragon's Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon's Dogma 2 has just one save file.

Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game's photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II," a Ninja Theory tweet reads. "Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week." 
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024.

It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

I don't mean to assume, but let's face it, it's probably your phone, where some idle doomscrolling likely awaits you, or some other, time-wasting distraction that will help fill the dead air between one task and the next. Well, While Waiting is a game that delves into precisely this fundamental human question: what is the best thing to do while waiting for something else to happen? It's from the makers of the very good puzzle game Moncage, and its newly released Steam demo is a pure, fidgety brilliance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

Having spent months of stubbornly maining Veteran and sticking as closely as possible to FPS convention, I’ve since found peace in the simple act of swinging knives/swords/giant electrified hammers into and through people. Mainly because it’s not so simple: for all its chaotic spectacle, the meleeing in Darktide (this month’s RPS Game Club star) works because it’s secretly been a rhythm game.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive. The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report. 
Now, it's official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports.

Following the rough launch of Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which is an HD port combo of the original Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II on modern consoles and PC, developer Aspyr Media says it's working to address issues and increase network stability. 
Shortly after the game's launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an "innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG."
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature "unique cooperative gameplay," the studio says. 
"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn," the announcement reads." 
There's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

In fairness, the newly revealed Open (or Opthreen), an RPO-themed metaverse battle royale thing, does look, sound, feel, and smell horrible, so a solid chunk of this week’s Electronic Wireless Show podcast is just us despairing over it. But there’s also some honest-to-goodness games chat, as we field a question from EWS listener Pete (thanks Pete!) on the games our younger selves were parentally forbidden from playing – and how we feel about them as ostensible grownups.

While Sega's Japanese social media account shared a photo of a Red statue standing alongside Sega's other mascots (see below), we haven't seen the acquisition impact the games to this point. That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds' eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic's world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio behind unexpectedly decent Mickey Mouse life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley are venturing into another fantasy land where anthropomorphic animals adventure with human chums, the Forgotten Realms setting of Dungeons & Dungeons. Today Gameloft announced they're making a D&D game offering a "hybrid of survival, life simulation and action RPG". They don't have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won't be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it's headed to PC and consoles.

While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a "joint project" between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won't be out in the next 12 months. Given the project's repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is getting delisted on Steam in Japan later this month. That's according to a new "Notice of End of Sales" post on the game's Steam page. From Friday, March 29, 2024, onward, the game will no longer be available for purchase in Japan on the storefront. 
However, online play will remain available after the game's delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store. 
Released less than two years ago on August 30, 2022, on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, The Cowabunga Collection getting delisted so soon comes as a shock. However, it's seemingly only affecting TMNT players in Japan. Game Informer reached out to publisher Konami to ask if there are plans to delist the game outside …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you're a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you'll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio's first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

For several months, the movie has been widely available on pirate sites too. While one might think that all demand would be satisfied, winning the Oscar for 'Best Picture' more than doubled the interest on pirate sites this week. The same Oscar boost affects other titles as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. 
For more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right. After that, check out this guide about how to beat Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's hardest platforming challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn't go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

This was surprising, because while I'd been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

Exploding into coins upon death notwithstanding, and to be clear, rad as hell. Happily, its Season 2 update is all about rewriting the rules of its glistening digital battlefields. I’ve played a few rounds and the new, hacking-themed gadgetry it introduces looks like just the thing to freshen The Finals up.

The ubiquitous chat client already lets you play a handful of approved games inside itself without dowloading or launching anything seperate, along with other 'Activities' like watching YouTube together, and next week it will open up to a whole lot more. Discord will let all developers make their own Activities, wanting to jam in more games and social hangout experiences and stuff. I'm broadly up for things removing faff from getting casual hangout games running with pals.

Chandlers's trademark "blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window" kind of zingers are very hard to do well, so it's better to say you're doing Philip Marlow badly on purpose. The trailer for Nobody Wants To Die seems like it's self-seriousness is actually self-awareness. I mean, I kind of refuse to believe that hard-boiled future crime detective James Karra saying "I'm in the business of secrets... But it's more of an addiction... And I like 'em straight... No chaser..." while sipping from a glass of amber liquor isn't indulging in some amount of winking and nudging.

Since then, the game has continued to garner attention from players for its great mix of survival mechanics and action-RPG combat. Now, just shy of two years in Early Access, V Rising will launch into 1.0 in May. 
More specifically, V Rising transitions into 1.0 on May 8. We learned during a State of Play in January that developer Stunlock Studios' vampire game would be coming to PlayStation 5 this year, and today's announcement further affirms the team is confident it will hit the platform in 2024.

        <updated>2024-03-13T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure," a press release reads. "The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon." 
As you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development.

        <updated>2024-03-13T12:30:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 


"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. 


For more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" with a 12-hour battery life. After that, read about how the PS5 surpassed 50 million units in December, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 PS5 games to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stealth games in which you can become "one with the shadows" cover a wide range, though I guess spectrum is the more appropriate word here. You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.
There are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.


The point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

A court in Barcelona has indeed authorized LaLiga to obtain the identities of subscribers at five major ISPs, but if our reading of court documents is accurate, LaLiga hasn't identified any, even by their IP addresses. As unlikely as it may sound, LaLiga may have no evidence that any subscriber did anything wrong, so ISPs have been instructed to find some.

Originally released on PC on May 30, 2023, Night Dive and publisher Prime Matter revealed today that System Shock hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 21, just shy of the game's one-year anniversary. 
This reveal comes by way of a new trailer over at IGN, which teases some of the sci-fi horror and first-person shooting players can expect in the game. Check it out for yourself below in the System Shock consoles release date trailer: 


The remake today is in great shape on PC, and players should expect a well-made retread of the classic game. This remake had been in the works for years before its PC release last year – check out the game in a pre-alpha state in 2016 here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze Studios CEO Tobias Sjögren is no longer with the studio and the Payday 3 developer is now recruiting for a new leader. This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. 
While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team's upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer's cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What's more, Korol says the game will feature "a rich Offline Mode" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal," Korol writes. "Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign." 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.

With more than 12 million monthly visits, Vumoo was one of the more popular piracy portals. The site was presumably being operated from Vietnam, where many of the largest pirate sites and services still reside today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arrowhead Game Studios is releasing a new patch for Helldivers 2 today that nerfs the spawn rate of heavily armored Terminid bug enemies like Chargers and Bile Titans alongside some other changes that should make fighting these enemies, especially on harder difficulties, easier. Set to go live today on PlayStation 5 and PC, Patch 1.000.102 follows a patch from last week that introduced fire tornadoes, meteor showers, weapon buffs, and more to the shooter. 
"Good day citizens of Super Earth," the patch notes read. "A new patch to aid you in your efforts is coming in. May Super Earth give you courage.

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003's Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written a bit about playing Helldivers 2 as a solo diver, noting that Arrowhead's frenetic shooter holds up surprisingly well when you rudely insist on treating it like an open world stealth sim, a la Metal Gear Solid V. The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an "agnostic", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very "arcadey" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.

"All I knew is I'm doing the new game for Blizzard," Bhimani says. "And I knew that Blizzard was, you know, no slouch. They've done a lot of really cool things before, so chances were this was gonna be really cool. But I had no idea. I don't think anyone really did."

In Brazil, a deal between MPA and ANCINE was effectively torn up for allegedly prioritizing U.S. content over that produced locally in Brazil.

And having finished the game, I'm unsure whether I've truly learned any more about the Moomins and their friends. But then again, I've come away thinking that it's a pleasant universe to spend a few hours in, where the wild is celebrated with rebellious song.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.
Player First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.
Every existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.
Lastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” 


MultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” 
Unfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Are you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI exclusively hit PlayStation 5 last June. However, Square Enix had already revealed a PC version of the action game was in development. When I spoke to producer Naoki Yoshida about it in Square Enix's Tokyo, Japan, offices for Game Informer's FFXVI cover story last year, he said players shouldn't expect the PC version anytime soon. 
With FFXVI's first DLC, Echoes of the Fallen, already out, and its second DLC, The Rising Tide, due out this spring, I spoke to Yoshida once more about the PC version. I also talked to him and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about The Rising Tide and what players can expect, and you can read Game Informer's exclusive preview here. 


While Yoshida is unable to share when the PC version of FFXVI will be released, he says the team is in the last sta…]]></summary>

A new presence can be seen through the mist, perched on its shoulder, whispering tendrils of video game news nuggets into its greedy, hungry ear. The Maw appears sated, but will the distraction hold while we await the return of our news editor Edwin, whose long weekend sojourns won't conclude until tomorrow? We pray and hope it will be satisfied in this relatively quiet week of game releases and newsy happenings, lest it turn its awful gaze upon us with a wrathful vengeance. FEED THE MAW.

The games join the Game Boy library, which is included with the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 a year).
Dr. Mario from Game Boy, Mario Golf from Game Boy Color, and Mario Tennis from Game Boy Color join the Switch Online Game Boy catalog.

Oddly enough, the library is missing all of the Pokémon titles, as well as the original Super Mario Land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released more than a decade ago, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is a little tricky to go back to in 2024 thanks to its 3DS exclusivity. However, during last September's Nintendo Direct, we learned that this well-liked sequel is making the leap to Switch as Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, joining the third entry in the hybrid console's catalog. Today, Nintendo announced that Luigi and his Poltergust 5000 will return to Switch in June.
When it arrived on 3DS in 2013, it received strong review scores, including an 8.5 from Game Informer. This sequel actually involves the younger Mario Bro visiting a series of mansions to capture ghosts and rescue Mario from King Boo. You can see the reveal trailer for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD below.


Luigi's Mansion 2 HD arrives on Nintendo Switch on June 27. If you just can't wait to bust ghosts as Mario's brother, be sure to check out Luigi's Mansion 3, which is perhaps one of the most underrated first-party games on Switch. You can read our review of Luigi's Mansion 3 here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beloved GameCube RPG, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, finally has a release date for Switch. Announced during September 2023's Nintendo Direct, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is regarded by many as the pinnacle of Mario's RPG outings, and since today is Mario Day, Nintendo took the opportunity to let fans know when they'd be able to play the remaster on Nintendo's hybrid console.
We still don't have many details for this version, but we do know that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door features improved graphics. It joins a collection of titles starring Mario and his friends over the last several months, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Princess Peach: Showtime, and the upcoming Luigi's Mansion 2 HD.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/10/new-super-mario-bros-animated-movie-announced-for-2026-release"/>
        <updated>2024-03-10T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.
While the announcement stops short of calling this "Super Mario Bros. 2" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. "As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more," Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. "This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.
What do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember when Ubisoft announced they were working on a movie adaptation of hacking series Watch Dogs, before it was even released? I sure didn’t! Well, allow us both to be reminded of something from over a decade ago, because the Watch Dogs film is still apparently A Thing. It’s more of A Thing now, too, because it has actual names attached rather than just a corporation’s vague “excitement” about licensing out its IP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a good management game, but my definition of "good" often includes words like "detailed", "complex", or "dangerously all-consuming". That doesn't mean, though, that I don't appreciate something light and simple now and then. In fact, Minami Lane might barely qualify as a management game by some standards.
There's no real pressure, no chance of failure, and its limit of a handful of levels lasting perhaps three or four hours just about taps it out. But sometimes such limitations are intentional, and exactly what you want from a game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to think we should bury Vampire: The Masquerade back in the forsaken graveyard where it was originally dug up, or at least banish the toothy reprobate back to its pen & paper castle. I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.
Which brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second part of Dune is out at the moment, and it has resulted in that most filthy of perversions, discourse - a pastime in which only the most unsavoury characters indulge. Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going "Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute."
"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis," reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>
