How to get the JAK Slash Aftermarket attachment in Modern Warfare 3 Season 5


In order to unlock the JAK Slash, you'll first need to complete any five of the Weekly Challenges available to you. This can be done via playing MW3's Multiplayer, Zombies, or Battle Royale modes. Each mode has a set of different challenges that you can pursue for the unlock. These challenges all count toward the required five, regardless of the game mode.


For the JAK Slash, I recommend completing all I've in MW3's Multiplayer mode, as the challenges there are super fast to finish and easy to do. There are several there that can be completed using one or two gun setups, which is highly convenient…]]></summary>

Anyone who's tried to cultivate a garden knows it's hard work. You can't just plant some flowers, water them once a week, and leave it at that. Every single flower, plant, and tree requires a different level of care; seasons and weather affect plants' growth, and some can't survive certain seasons. But, as English poet Albert Austin wrote in his book The Garden that I Love, "The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature.

Well folks, another week has come and gone, which means it's time to reveal what we're all going to be playing this weekend. Before we do, however, let's see what's been going on this week.
First up, Monolith Soft is recruiting for what it simply describes as a "new RPG"; chances are it'll probably be a new Xenoblade title for Nintendo's upcoming hardware, but who knows. Elsewhere, DOOM + DOOM II got a new release on the Switch eShop courtesy of iD software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames (more on that later), while we reviewed what we think is one of the best 2D action-platformers on Switch with Volgarr the Viking II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might take the crown for the best Doom news today. Limited Run Games is reissuing Doom for the SNES. This is no mere re-release of the 1995 console port. It’s getting spruced up to run better and include more.


Most of the early console ports of Doom were derided for various reasons. Even consoles that should have been able to play the game well couldn’t without severe drawbacks. The SNES version had many, making it pale in comparison to the original DOS version, but it held up a smidge better than some others. It was rather impressive that it would even run on the platform, though it needed some assistance from Nintendo’s proprietary FX Chip.




I loved Doom when I was a wee tot, but my parents wouldn’t buy me the PC version. It wasn’t because of the violence, however, but rather t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a beginner, it can be hard to wrap your head around a game like Clash Royale, as it requires an immense amount of strategic decision-making to win a match. But any strategy starts with a good deck and efficient elixir management. 


You can make a deck full of heavy cards, yet you will find it difficult to win a match. To help you overcome the hurdle of assembling good cards, here is a comprehensive guide to the best Clash Royale decks for beginners.


What are the best Clash Royale decks for beginners?


Before we dive any further, it is important to know that these decks are crafted from cards from Arena Seven or below in Clash Royale. It is safe to say that any player who is above that arena level is not a beginner anymore.

        <updated>2024-08-09T19:48:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roguelite deck builder is pretty far from my favorite genre. I’ve enjoyed some of them, but I wouldn’t actively seek out a new one. Rogue Light Deck Builder, on the other hand…


That’s because Rogue Light Deck Builder is about building a deck. Not a deck of cards, but more like something you’d put furniture on so you can stare at your neighbors. However, there are roguelite elements.


You’re given $1,000,000, a hammer, and a husband. You must construct a deck. The light isn’t very reliable. Your aim with a hammer is deplorable. But the deck must be built.




While Rogue Light Deck Builder is just coming to my attention now and is coming to Steam soon, it’s been out on itch.io for a decent while. It’s $2, and the blurb suggests it will last around 20-30 minutes. I could have probably played this in preparation for this article, but I didn’t. I’ll likely grab it soon, but I like to write like I live my life: uninformed and bewildered.


The grotesque Unreal 5 visual style really appeals to me for some reason. It reminds me of a similar FPS about Presidents fighting weird monsters that I can’t remember the name of. This is why I should write about everything I play, then I’d have a record of it. Instead, I can just clearly remember the game but can’t recall the name. GoblinAmerica! That was it.


Oh, wait. It’s the same guy. The visual style is so evocative because Gil Lawson is the developer behind Rogue Light Deck Builder and GoblinAmerica. I can either consider this a really dumb moment because I didn’t realize it or give myself credit for being able to recognize a shared aesthetic. My brain will probably lean toward the former.


Anyway, you can get Rogue Light Deck Builder on PC via itch.io right now, but it’s coming to Steam soon. Take a peek at the demo for GoblinAmerica, while you’re at it.

        <updated>2024-08-09T19:41:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An incredibly underrated fighting game, DNF Duel, is currently free-to-own on the Epic Games Store right now. It may not have many players now, but I still think it is worth playing.


It is being offered alongside CYGNI: All Guns Blazing, a visually intriguing shoot 'em up, and the Conduit Free Unlock Bundle for Apex Legends, which grants you the Legend Conduit for free, plus a skin. They are all free-to-own forever, as long as you claim them before August 15 at 4 pm BST / 11 am ET/ 8 am PT.


But why should you play DNF Duel (besides that it's free)? Sit down and let me tell you.


It's actually published by Arc System Works, makers of Guilty Gear, so of course it has an awesome anime art style with a deep fighting system. I enjoy ArcSys games, so I picked it up back when it came out in 2022 and loved the heck out of it.


One of the main mechanics of the game is being able to use simple direction inputs for moves – think Super Smash Bros. However, if you prefer traditional fighting game controls, those are available as well, and will even reward you with more damage. It's an input style that's become more popular in recent years, expanding across a bunch of different fighting games including Street Fighter 6.


We here at Destructoid thought it was an easy-to-learn hard-to-master fighting game, but worried about its longevity. And while its online servers aren’t super populated right now, it still has a niche community and had a community tournament at EVO 2024.


I still highly recommend trying it out if you are a newcomer to fighting games. Maybe just find a Discord or group that plays together, if you are planning on playing online. Plus, if you enjoy it, there are five DLC characters that are also on sale for 50% right now to expand the roster.

The Brazilian defender is one of the latest additions to the FUTTIES promo as part of the Team 4 celebrations. As he's part of an objective set, you won't have to spend any resources to unlock the card. Instead, there are certain tasks that have to be completed before you can get your hands on the latest version of Dodo. 


EA FC 24 Dodo FUTTIES objective tasks


There are four tasks under the Dodo FUTTIES objective in EA FC 24. All four tasks can be completed in any order you want, but some of them will end quicker. 



Assist Machine: Assist 5 goals using players from Brazil in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Serie A Goals: Score 6 goals using players from the Serie A in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi- Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Play 5: Play 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the Serie A in your starting 11


Victory Mindset: Win 4 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the Serie A in your starting 11.



To get the card quickly, you can play matches in Squad Battles. It's always easier to play against AI-controlled opponents. You can also tune down the difficulty of the matches to make it easier for you to complete all the tasks. 


Dodo's FUTTIES card could have been better in terms of the available playstyles. The absence of Whipped Cross really reduces its ranking on the current meta. Then again, it's a free card at the end of the day. You can get the card by completing some simple tasks, and use it in a SBC if it has no other use for you in EA FC 24.

How to get the Axial Conduit Unique Pants


The best way to get Axial Conduit in Diablo 4 Season 5 is to target farm the Uber Boss Grigoire, The Galvanic Saint. Grigoire specifically has a higher drop rate for the Axial Conduit Unique Pants, allowing you to farm him for the fastest opportunity to get Axial Conduit to drop.


You can find Grigoire, The Galvanic Saint in the Hall of the Pentient, a Level 75 dungeon in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Malcom FUTTIES SBC is now live in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team, and you can add the Brazilian winger to your squad in just a few quick steps. 


Malcom has been added to the FUTTIES SBC as part of EA FC's Team 4 celebrations. Since he's part of a special challenge, all players have an equal chance to get the card. Let's take a look at if you should invest your resources to get the Malcom card, or look elsewhere. 


EA FC 24 Malcom FUTTIES SBC tasks


The Malcom FUTTIES SBC is pretty easy to complete in EA FC 24 as there's just one task. The task has certain conditions that you'll need to fulfil during squad submission.


 Task - Malcom FUTTIES



Min. 1 Players from: Brazil


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 24 Malcom FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here's the solution for the Malcom FUTTIES SBC in EA FC 24. 


Task - Malcom FUTTIES



Dani Parejo 86


Cristiana Girelli 86


Bella Bixby 84


Nacho Fernandez 83


Merle Frohms 85


Koke 84


Dabritz 84


Alex Grimaldo 84


Koen Casteels 84


Eder Militao 86


Romelu Lukaku 84



Given the low price, the Malcom is one card everyone should grab. There's not much to discuss, as a 95-rated card at this stage is only suitable for beginners. It even lacks a 5* Weak Foot, but the playstyles are decent. If you have the fodder, which you should have, make sure to complete the challenge here for high-rated fodder.

If you are a fan of Doom, you probably already own every game in the series six times over and don’t need something like the Doom Anthology. That is unless you want to own a 5” replica BFG.


Let’s be clear here: this is the Doom (2016) BFG9000 that carried over into Doom Eternal. I would be very interested to get my hands on a replica of the original Doom (1993) BFG9000. The game depicts that particular weapon from the top and from the side and I still have no idea what it’s supposed to look like. It looks like you’re holding a spaceship, and I would like an explanation.


At 5”, the replica is unfortunately not the actual size of a BFG, so it is for display purposes only. You’re going t…]]></summary>

Although it'll be difficult to cover all of their weaknesses, you can still use a few handy tricks to fight them off. Here's how to beat Arlo in Pokémon Go, including the best team and counters.


How to defeat Arlo in Pokémon Go


The Pokémon Go Adventure Week update changes Arlo's classic team ensemble, which you may have gotten familiar with. In particular, he will now start with Shadow Anorith, a fairly strong Rock and Bug Type. If you haven't found Arlo yet, you'll need to beat six Team Go Rocket Grunts to unlock the Rocket Radar for his location.


Once you've found him, it's time to start building the right team to withstand his attacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FUTTIES Daily Challenge  SBC (Week 4) is now live in EA FC 24, and it's yet another chance to recycle some of your fodder to score valuable packs. 


These fodder challenges are pretty easy to complete and don't require any expensive resources. The key is to meet all of the conditions listed below and then submit the squad. Doing so successfully rewards a pack, which can contain special items like FUTTIES Team 4 cards. While it's not guaranteed that there will be a promo item, it's always efficient to trade in fodder items that you don't need. 


EA FC 24 FUTTIES Daily Challenge  SBC (Week 4) tasks


Like the last three weeks, the FUTTIES Daily Challenge  SBC (Week 4) has just one task to complete. There are certain conditions that you'll need to meet during squad submission. 
Task - FUTTIES Daily Challenge



Max. 2 Players from the same League


Min. 4 Players from the same Nation


Min. 1 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 75


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31



EA FC 24 FUTTIES Daily Challenge  SBC (Week 4) solutions


There can be different solutions for the FUTTIES Daily Challenge  SBC (Week 4). Of course, it mostly depends on the cards that you already have in your inventory. Here's one efficient set of solutions you could utilize in order to complete the challenge for cheap. 


Task - FUTTIES Daily Challenge



Perisic LW 79


Carranza ST 72


Ocampos RW 80


Varela CDM 76


Castro CM 72


Quignon CDM 72


Silva LB 72


Insaurralde CB 72


Uremovic CB 72


Blondel RB 72


Hoyos 72



After completing the challenge, you'll get a Prime Gold Players pack. The pack is definitely worth more than the combined value of the fodder you'll need to use in the SBC. With so many special cards in the pack (FUTTIES and Re-Release Team 3 combined), it's always beneficial to open as many packs as possible. 


Make sure to complete this challenge daily in EA FC 24 as long as you have the required fodder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gear up for more Borderlands, as Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has said that the company is working on a new entry, alongside a new Brothers in Arms and more. As the Borderlands movie reportedly stinks up theaters, a "new mainline title" has been teased by Pitchford during an Epic Games interview published Thursday. 


When asked if Gearbox is working on the next "mainline" game in the Borderlands series, Pitchford replied: "Of course we are.” 


That's not it, either. While discussing the new Borderlands movie that is available in theatres this weekend, Pitchford teased to Epic Games that multiple projects are in development, thanks to a "leadership cluster," which "drives a project from cradle to grave." 


“With this approach, we’re able to spin up multiple things, including a new Brothers in Arms game, which has been in development for a while—but we’re not yet ready to talk about it," said Pitchford. Perhaps, we could see this project announced during The Game Awards this year. The Brothers in Arms series had a TV show in the works in 2020 as well, and there have been mentions of a new entry in the series over the years.


Duke Nukem is also referenced during the interview. "We’re working on every IP. I mean, we just launched Homeworld 3, and there’s still work going on there," Pitchford said. "And there’s Risk of Rain, and there’s Duke Nukem, and there’s more.”


The latest entry in the Borderlands series was the spinoff Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, which was received relatively well by critics and fans. "Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is more Borderlands, and the lighter fantasy fare might actually get people to dive in for the first time," said our review. "With that in mind, it’s still more Borderlands, so the same basic formula isn’t going to magically change your stance if you’re a lapsed fan."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mines in Fields of Mistria can seem like an endless network of caverns, but do they have an end? And if so, how far down is it? Well, I’ve gone down as far as I can and discovered everything there is to be found inside the Mines, so let’s look at what I’ve found. 


When you interact with the elevator within the Mines in Mistria, it looks like there should be a total of 100 levels. However, Fields of Mistria has only just been released into Early Access and currently, there are only 60 levels to explore. 


Upon reaching floor 60 of the Mines, you’ll encounter the Priestess again only to be told that you cannot go any further and you must wait. There’s another unnamed Seal on floor 60, just like those on floor 20 and floor 40, although you’re unable to even discover which items you need to find in order to break through it let alone handing them over and getting through the door.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Will more floors be added to the Mines in Fields of Mistria?


According to the Early Access roadmap released by RPG Studios, there will indeed be new biomes coming to the Mines, although it’s not clear when this will happen. 


The new biomes aren’t coming as part of the first major planned update, which is expected to arrive at some point before 2024 is over, but it is detailed in the ‘future updates’ section of the roadmap. 


Image via NPC Studios


If I were to guess, judging from the floor 60 Seal room, I expect the floors post this latest seal to be filled with Gold and volcanic resources just begging to be used in our crafting endeavors. 


Until we can get through the door, though, the Mines are still worth diving into whenever you’re at a loss for what to do. Not only are there valuable resources inside, but you’ll also need to keep going inside to increase both your Mining and Combat levels to unlock new perks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The culture around collecting knives in Counter-Strike 2 is fascinating. Players can unbox them from CS2 cases, albeit with an extremely low chance of doing so, or they can buy them directly from the Steam Marketplace. 


The kicker is that these knives cost hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of dollars. There are even several skins for each type of Counter-Strike 2 knife, giving them a unique appearance. It's almost a subsection of the game's community at this point, with many players searching for the perfect pattern or wear rating before settling on their perfect knife.

They typically aren't all that great, but the weapons available this year are well worth adding to your arsenal. Among all the weapons is a hand cannon with some intriguing perks as possible rolls.

If you’re a puzzle fan who wants something unique to add to your library, you’re in for a treat. The Lullaby of Life is a sound-based puzzle experience which places you in the blobby shoes of a particle with the ability to create music, exploring the origins of the universe.
At first glance, this game is striking. The aesthetic is vibrant and psychedelic, with seven different chapters, each revolving around a new celestial body and all with their own unique visuals, quirks, and styles of puzzle. Some may require you to work on timing, while others may test your ability to spot hidden paths.

The very first Legend of Zelda LEGO set is just weeks away from release, with the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 shipping from 1st September. After initially selling out rather quickly, pre-orders are once again available with some new options appearing courtesy of the My Nintendo Store UK & Ireland.
The set – which contains 2,500 pieces and four brand-new Minifigures – can be bought on its own from the My Nintendo Store at its regular retail price of £259.99 / $299.99. However, should you also want a copy of the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, which we imagine most Zelda fans probably do, you can order both to take 10% off the Great Deku Tree's cost.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A's application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rear-end reservations.
Bare Butt Boxing from publisher and developer Tuatara Games makes a good first impression with its quirky character avatars, colorful maps, and cheeky premise. Though the title delivers knockabout fun and floaty arena combat chaos, the overall experience is a rather shallow one and not exactly the ‘Punch-Out!! With Your Arse Out’ concept we were primed for.
Players choose from one of six alien fighters to control and pummel each other across a variety of maps. You’ll find no traditional boxing rings here, but rather some uniquely designed environments containing portals that swallow anybody knocked into them as well as holes and gaps that send you hurling off the stage only to respawn a moment later.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

Rainbow Arts' Rendering Ranger: R² is one of the rarest Super Famicom games in existence, but thanks to a partnership between Ziggurat Interactive and Limited Run Games, it's now heading to the Switch and will launch this Winter.
Although initially announced back in 2022, Ziggurat and Limited Run have been fairly quiet on the release since then, but fans can finally get their hands on either a digital version or physical edition later this year, bringing a swift end to the title's long-running scarcity. Originally released in Japan in 1995, only 10,000 copies were made and it quickly became one of the most sought-after console games of all time.

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most surprising aspects of the forthcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard was the news that we won’t be able to control other party members in the action-RPG. A feature that’s been core to the previous three mainline entries in the series, its removal has left many wondering what is up. Well, according to Edge,…

Powerful Pro Baseball 2024-25 once again finds itself at the top, but One Piece Odyssey suffers a significant drop in sales to land at number nine this week, leaving the likes of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD to enjoy higher positions in the top ten.

For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if the company that sold your cheese also sold your PC gaming hardware? This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

The blockbuster JRPG isn't out on PC yet, and developers Square Enix have not given a concrete release date for it, but this does seem to be prep work for the inevitable. And with Squeenix in attendance at Gamescom, it's possible we'll know more soon.

My own very petty victory as the ultimate gambler aside, it's by and large an industry built on preying on the vulnerable, so it's no surprise that Balatro developer LocalThunk is so dead against ever seeing his poker puzzler used for evil that he's made a specific stipulation in his will.

Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

When the press got wind of it, the major countered that "everyone was happy", which is hard to argue with, especially since there are no official cinemas nearby.

For example: it's thanks to Resetera member AstralSphere that I know about Alistair Aitcheson's Magic Box and BizHawk retro emulation tools, which - amongst other things - allow you to play old Sonic the Hedgehog games in giddy parallel, shuffling between them whenever you collect a ring.

As a result, telecoms regulator AGCOM has summoned Google and Cloudflare to an official meeting to hear all about their plans to defeat piracy. The Italian Competition and Market Authority recently launched an antitrust investigation against Google, so the meeting in September will take place under dark clouds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titan Quest 2! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former Destiny 2 game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

Now that Valve have shown it’s possible to quickly turn around an upgraded handheld without enraging owners of the original, Lenovo have hinted at a new Legion Go, MSI have revealed an improved Claw, and Asus have released this here ROG Ally X. A ROG Ally, again – but better? Yes, it is, in almost every way except the speed at which it’ll plunge you into financial destitution.

The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies. I… am cautiously optimistic? I think?

According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hardened battle royalists will remember Caldera, the sandy island map of bunkers and palm trees in Call Of Duty: Warzone. It got shut down last year as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI.

In my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”
“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.

I just got done pining for the merest whiff of Dungeon Keeper when what should appear on Steam but a free prologue for delightful voxel-arty management sim Dungeon Tycoon. I’m using the word ‘appear’ because, following yet more industry layoffs yesterday, I’m choosing to adopt the brain of an idiot as to shield myself from the crushing reality of material conditions. So, anyway, the magical game goblins whacked the demo on Steam, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. Thanks, adequately compensated and unionised gobbos!

Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.
Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in Planet Coaster 2’s new deep dive trailer.

There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain. Quick, before your brain bursts, watch the video for yourself below.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

Hear the curl of the monkey's paw? Yeah, it's a mobile game port with the touchscreen prompts seemingly still intact, and its publisher is also pushing a "commemorative Paris 2024 NFT Digital Pin collection".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Garry Newman has confirmed that the DMCA notice was sent last year, and has since been "all resolved", in an email to IGN.
Original story:
Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) available to try, and good news for Radeon GPU owners: it is drastically, almost comically better than the original version. Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we're told Americans don't understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.

It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up a playable demo of the bright JRPG on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.
