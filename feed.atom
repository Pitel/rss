Update: Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic has been added to this list. Enjoy!

We're almost at the halfway point through November, and it's been a busy old time all right. With Pokémon arriving very soon, we've been digging into the minutiae of the excellent Animal Crossing DLC while we have the time. Elsewhere, Twitch appeared on Switch, as did GTA Trilogy in unfortunately poor form, and we've also taken delivery of the delightful Zelda Game & Watch, too.
Now, though, it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I'll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and "HD" texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

Nintendo launched its Switch Online 'Expansion Pack' premium tier earlier this month, but it's not exactly received the warmest welcome from fans - with concerns raised about the price and value, the quality of N64 emulation, and the official trailer for it becoming the most disliked video ever on Nintendo's YouTube channel.
During a recent interview with The Verge, following on from the news that Nintendo's paid subscription service now has over 32 million members, as of September 2021 - Nintendo of America president, Doug Bowser, kind of addressed these fan complaints of "poor emulation" with the following response:

Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition is now available on the Nintendo Switch and multiple other platforms but it's not got off to the best start - with fans supposedly encountering all sorts of issues in each of the games.
This latest trilogy, in case you didn't know, was handled by the Florida-based team at Grove Street Games - who has been porting GTA titles to various platforms for around a decade now and was responsible for the latest effort. The company's CEO and owner, Thomas Williamson, has now publically acknowledged fan criticisms - with the following tweet, that perhaps unsurprisingly hasn't gone down well with a lot of fans:

It should have been so easy, or so one would have thought. Three epic open world masterclasses that took the gaming industry by storm back in the early noughties, finally arriving on Switch and giving us all an absolute smorgasbord of hilarious criminal hijinks to dig into. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition on Nintendo's portable console should be a marriage made in heaven. However, as it turns out, Rockstar must have been almost fully divorced from reality to let this port release in the state in which we've reviewed it.
The games here themselves need no introduction. Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City and San Andreas released in 2001, 2002 and 2004 respectively, delivering spectacular open worlds that are absolutely oozing with edgy atmosphere, amazing soundtracks, memorable characters and hilarious slapstick action. They're meticulously crafted slices of satircal Americana in which to run amok. That stuff is all still here, but it's been massively compromised by a port that beggars belief, especially considering that the most recent of these games released 17 years ago.

As far as we know, Obi-Wan hasn’t yet seen Anakin as Vader in between the end of Revenge of the Sith and the start of this series so it seems we’ll get to see them meet for the first time on-screen. 
We’ll also get to see Obi-Wan actor, Ewan McGregor, share the screen with Anakin actor, Hayden Christensen, for the first time in years during this series. Neither of these actors has ma…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/12/sony-celebrates-playstation-5-anniversary-reveals-top-played-games-in-its-first-year"/>
        <updated>2021-11-12T18:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In honor of the first anniversary of the launch of PlayStation 5, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan took to the PlayStation Blog to take a look back at the year that was as well as what's to come.
Even for a year where it felt like PS5 consoles were hard to find (and still are!), gamers put in plenty of time on the now-current gen device. "PS5 gamers have collectively played more than 4.6 billion hours of gameplay on PS5 and broadcast more than 26 million hours of content," Ryan boasted. No doubt there's been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. 
Fortnite
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
FIFA 21
NBA 2K21
Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
Destiny 2
MLB The Show 21
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Demon’s Souls
NBA 2K22
It's great to see Miles Morales and Demon's Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they're day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. 
Jim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.
Despite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it's had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade. That is if you're lucky enough to find one in the coming months. 
What's your most played games on PS5 this year? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

While the games are a blast on their own merits, many fans remember punching in the copious amounts of cheat codes to make each title even more delightfully absurd. Most of these cheats apply to the Definitive Editions and we've gathered all of them here in one place. 
To activate the cheats, simply enter the correct button prompts while in-game. Keep in mind that Rockstar has already warned that an unspecified "couple of cheats" have been removed from The Definitive Editions due to technical reasons. If a code doesn't work, that's likely the reason. Also, using cheats will lock certain trophies/achievements so be sure…]]></summary>

That’s because a new Predator movie is due out next year, as reported by IndieWire on Twitter. Titled Prey, it’s being directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane director, Dan Trachtenberg, and it will stream on Hulu sometime in 2022. It’s unclear based on IndieWire’s wording if the movie is streaming exclusively on Hulu or if it will simply stream on the service and hit theaters next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 3DS spin-off concept finds its true home.
Back when Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer was released on 3DS it was considered by some to be a slightly strange beast. It was enjoyable and charming enough, but its main issue was that it was a tough sell as a standalone retail game. Once you took the plunge it was a lovely time, but the designer/decorating concept didn't sit easily with Nintendo's release strategy.
We're now in a different time of more powerful hardware and a far more successful and substantial eShop, and as a result Nintendo has decided to take the plunge with its first paid DLC in a mainline Animal Crossing game — aside from the monetisation in the free-to-play mobile title Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, of course. Available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack or as a standalone purchase, Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise offers a lot of content but, most importantly, integrates naturally with the main experience to give it even more depth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer People Can Fly will air its first Outriders Broadcast since the game launched on April 1. The presentation will give fans a peek at a “colossal” free content update hitting the cooperative shooter in the near future.
People Can Fly provides no other hints as to what this update entails. If you’ve enjoyed Outriders and the idea of playing more of it sounds appealing, you’ll need to tune into Square Enix’s Twitch channel this Monday, November 15 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific/12:00 p.m. Eastern.  
Outriders has been relatively quiet the past few months in terms of major updates. Outside of squashing bugs, stabilizing servers, and tinkering with loot drops, People Can Fly has kept any big expansion plans close to the vest until now. The game has felt a bit forgotten as a result despite earning a 9 out of 10 review score from us at launch. Outriders is an entertaining co-op shooter, especially alongside friends, so we’re excited to see what People Can Fly has in store. 
Outriders is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC. The game is also part of Xbox Game Pass on both console and PC. 
Are you still playing Outriders? If not, what sort of content update would entice you to return? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

I've tried to play FromSoftware's much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I'm simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I've come to realise I simply don't have the time or the patience to see it through. I'm not sure I ever will, either. 
It's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I've fallen hook, line and sinker for Death's Door, the crow reaper sword 'em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

As you can see in the tweet above, the skin and accompanying items are now available for purchase in the Fortnite Item Shop. Her set features the outfit, the Phoenix Force back bling, and the Rising Phoenix Emote. You’ll also receive the Wrath of the Phoenix Loading Screen with the set as well, according to Epic Games. 
Dark Phoenix joins other skins recently added to Fortnite such as Jinx from League of Legends, which represents the first time a League of Legends character has appeared in a non-Riot franchise, and Naruto, although this was a collaboration tease and we’re still in the dark about what’s actually coming from the Shippuden series. Be sure to check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and Dc superheroes and supervillains in Fornite after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My name is Neo(Grip).

For gamers that tend to play their Switch more in handheld mode than docked, Switch OLED is an impressive upgrade that expands the size of the console's screen by reducing the size of the bezel. The console itself is almost the same size as the original — we say almost because the OLED unit is a teeny 0.1 of an inch longer than the regular Switch. It's a minor difference that is barely noticeable in the flesh or when you slide it into the dock, but one that you'll definitely notice if you try to put the newer console into a grip designed for the original.

Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

In a rare moment of financial openness, if you will, Nintendo has released some official numbers regarding its October sales of Switch consoles, Metroid Dread, and more. 
In a new interview with The Washington Post, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser revealed that the company sold 711,000 Switch consoles in the U.S. in October. Of those 711,000, Bowser says 314,000 of them were the recently-released OLED model. He also revealed that many of the Switch units sold were bought by people that already owned one and they were upgrading to the OLED or buying another for someone else. 
On the Metroid Dread front, 854,000 copies were sold in October, and Bowser says this is the best Metroid launch in series history.

Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition might be going through its fair share of issues at the moment, with seemingly boundless glitches and rather negative messages from the developers, but we've got one good bit of news to report: the game showcases a 'big head' mode.
The cheat is accessed by inputting the famous Konami code – Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A – and works across all three games included in the package. As you might imagine, it causes the craniums of all characters in the game to swell to comical proportions, as you can see from the video above.

Early chart tracking suggested that Metroid Dread was enjoying a successful time at retail when it launched on Switch last month, but new sales data confirms that the game has actually had the best opening month for any game of the series to date (in the US, at least).
The NPD Group's Mat Piscatella confirms that Dread debuted as October's third best-selling game in the US, and the best-selling on Switch (which also happened to be the best-selling console of the month). Piscatella says, "Metroid Dread achieved the highest launch month sales of any Metroid franchise release in tracked history," and that its launch month physical dollar sale "nearly doubled those of the previous franchise best, Metroid Prime".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, you’re not actually able to play it at the moment because the Rockstar Games Launcher is down and has been down for nearly 20 hours. 
As first reported by IGN, Rockstar’s own game launcher went down about 18 hours ago and because that’s how PC players must access the trilogy, they aren’t able to play their new games. Rockstar has also pulled the trilogy from sale on PC so if you don’t already own it, it’s not something you can purchase at the moment. 
Rockstar Support Twitter account tweeted yesterday. “Services will return as soon as maintenance is completed.” 



Services for the Rockstar Games Launcher and supported titles are temporarily offline for maintenance. Services will return as soon as maintenance is completed.
November 11, 2021
Rockstar Support tweeted out an update 14 hours after that first tweet: maintenance was still occurring and the launcher was still down. There’s been no update since then at the time of this writing. 
Other than needed “maintenance,” Rockstar has not formally announced exactly what’s wrong or what’s going on with trilogy. Perhaps something happened on the backend of the launcher or maybe something is messed up in the code of the PC version. Hopefully Rockstar updates players on what happened when the game goes back online (and is available for purchase again). 
While waiting for that, check out the full track list available in the trilogy and then read about how Rockstar had to remove a couple of cheats from it due to technical reasons. Check out this story about how San Andreas is being developed for Oculus Quest 2 after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time.
The Star Wars universe has always been far richer and more interesting than just the small slice shown off in the massively popular films, although most of this expanded lore has since been ‘decanonized’ shortly after Disney acquired the IP. One of the most notable parts of this legacy content was Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (or KOTOR if you're syllable sensitive), which originally saw release on Xbox & PC back in 2003 and will soon be receiving a full scale modern remake on the newest consoles. Taking place in a mostly unexplored distant past in the Star Wars timeline, this Bioware RPG was quite an impressive achievement back in the day and still remains a compelling experience now. Though there are some elements of KOTOR that absolutely show their age, this is a solid, nostalgia-laden title that we're happy to have available on-the-go.
KOTOR takes place approximately 4,000 years before the prequel films, so there are no Skywalkers or confusingly resurrected emperors to be seen here. The game opens shortly after the Galactic Republic has barely finished a war against the Mandalorians and now finds itself being invaded by an armada led by the two Jedi-turned Sith who spearheaded the initial war effort. Though one of the Sith, Darth Revan, has been killed, their apprentice Darth Malak is still hellbent on completing their mission of eliminating the Republic. In the midst of all this, you play a simple ‘nobody’ character who gets caught up in the struggle and ultimately changes the outcome of the conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dice has revealed its post-launch plans for the first year of Battlefield 2042 and there’s a lot of content on the way for the multiplayer-only title. 
Battlefield 2042 is out now for those with access to its early access period, and the full title will be out for most on November 19. As you jump into the game, you’ll be treated to a sizeable amount of maps, specialists, weapons, and more, but according to a new blog post from Dice, this is just the beginning. In its first year, you can expect multiple seasons and accompanying battle passes, new specialists, and possibly some new maps.

“In our first year of live service, we will deliver four Seasons, with four Battle Passes, four new Specialists, and new locations along with more fresh content,” Dice’s blog post reads. “We also intend to deliver updates to Battlefield Portal that will give players more ways to build and share new Battlefield experiences with the world.” 
Continuing in the blog, Dice says for Season 1, expect a new Specialist, one Battle Pass, and some additional Portal content. They even tease that players might see some “new sights” (presumably by way of new maps) as the story of 2042 unfolds. More details regarding that will be shared early next year, Dice says. 
“During launch, we’ll also kick off the Preseason with Weekly Missions and Rewards, Limited Time Modes, featured Creator Spotlights and experiences in Battlefield Portal, and more,” the blog post reads. 
While waiting for all of this new content to hit 2042, check out Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review in progress and then check out Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Battlefield 2042. Read about its new Hazard Zone game mode after that.

Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition (let's just say 'GTA Trilogy' for the rest of the article) arrived with plenty of buzz yesterday, though aside from a near-launch trailer there wasn't a huge amount of build-up. There wasn't much footage either, or reviews, which perhaps led to some nerves around how good and 'definitive' it would be.
We shared some footage of GTA Trilogy on Switch yesterday, which is just gameplay without any commentary, and we are working on a review. Though some are certainly happy enough with the results, we've had various members of our team and others on social media being distinctly unimpressed with various aspects. In fact, considering the hype and excitement that normally accompanies a Rockstar / GTA release this feels like a mis-step, at least if online noise is to be believed.

Super Impossible Road, a multiplayer racer that'll have you hurtling through space, will launch on Nintendo Switch next month before its arrival on other consoles, it's been confirmed.
Rogue Games' "lightning-paced" title will hit the Switch eShop on 9th December, priced at $19.99. The game offers a career mode, an endless mode, and multiplayer for two-to-four players, and all of these run at 60fps. That's right, even the four-player split-screen mode runs at 60fps – something that even Mario Kart 8 Deluxe doesn't manage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.

It's a cool little device with plenty of features, but there's one little secret that Nintendo kept from us building up to its launch.
While your attention will no doubt be gobbled up by the system's colour screen and the Zelda games included when your unit arrives, make sure to pop the console out of its casing and flip it over when you get the chance. On the back, and in the right lighting conditions, you should be able to see a glowing Triforce symbol, as shared by Nintendo Life reader @Ferdsigner:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

Nintendo tweeted the surprise announcement today that you can download the app from the Switch eShop. Now you can watch your streamer of choice play Animal Crossing: New Horizons or complain about the Nintendo 64 emulation on the online Expansion Pack. Given the lack of many popular streaming services on the eShop, such as Netflix, the fact that Twitch made the cut is a small miracle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you preordered a Playdate handheld gaming device that was set to ship this year, you’re going to have to wait a little bit longer. 
Panic Inc. announced today that its first batch of Playdates originally set to ship in 2021 have been delayed to early 2022, citing a “critical battery issue” that was caught late in the process. As a result, all batteries in Playdates set to ship had to be replaced.
“This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball and we halted production at the factory,” a press release reads. “We made the difficult, expensive call to replace all of our existing batteries with new ones from a totally different battery supplier.” 
Panic says the first batch consisted of 20,000 units, all planned to ship late 2021 (presumably now or soon) but that now, they’ll ship in early 2022. A more precise shipping window was not revealed. If you’ve preordered a Playdate, Panic says your place in line to actually receive the device will not change so long as your preorder remains active. 
For more about this unique handheld gaming device, check out Game Informer’s breakdown of its price, its first slate of games, and more. The Playdate isn't the only upcoming handheld device to suffer a delay. The release of Valve's Steam Deck was just pushed from this holiday to a February 2022 launch.

This news comes by way of Gematsu, which reports that Extraction will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Luna, and Stadia on January 20. Ubisoft has also revealed some more information about the game’s built-in features such as cross-play and more.

“The game will support cross-play and cross-save between all platform families on day one,” Ubisoft’s press release reads. “Owners of both Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction will instantly unlock the entire roster of 18 operators in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and will get the United Front cosmetic bundles in both games.” 
Extraction will also support cross-progression and cross-save across all platforms. Gematsu reports that two Buddy Pass tokens will come with each copy of Extraction. These tokens allow you to invite two friend to play it with you for 14 days for free. If they decide to pick the game up, their progression will transfer over to the full release, too. 
Ubisoft also released a new trailer detailing today’s news and more, which you can watch above. 
Today’s January 20 release date news comes just a couple of months after Extraction was delayed from its original Fall release date to sometime in January. While waiting for it to be released, read about how its old name was Rainbow Six Quarantine (you can probably guess why it was changed) and then check out Game Informer’s Rainbow Six Siege review after that.

IGN premiered the trailer for the wall-crawler’s upcoming Hero Event on November 30, which will be exclusive to the PlayStation versions of the game.
For those afraid Crystal Dynamics might screw up Spidey from a personality standpoint, the trailer proves he still has his endearingly dorky sense of humor and quips (including making a Mortal Kombat reference of all things). It remains to be seen how Spider-Man’s powers translate into gameplay given there’s no in-game footage. Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival.

Spider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”. He’ll team up with the Avengers to take on AIM and thwart a mysterious new threat. There’s no indication of how big or long the event is, but it will be free to PS5 and PS4 players. For those playing on other platforms, a big update also hits November 30 that adds a new four-player raid, power level cap increase, and other changes you can read more about here.

Halo Infinite is a few mere weeks away, but you don't have to wait that long to get a new look at campaign gameplay! Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief's next adventure!
There's a ton to unpack here, but we're showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today's video. Throughout Halo Infinite's campaign, you'll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that's saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game's most treacherous bosses. There's no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you'll see in the footage above). 
While you're giving the Banished hell, don't forget to look around. In today's gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game's upgrade currency that will enhance Chief's equipment, such as the Grappleshot. 
We also get to show off one of the game's newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It's a Banished weapon that feels like it's in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.
This is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343's latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more! Thanks for watching, and we hope you enjoy the coverage!]]></summary>

As I checked out a three-hour demo of the campaign, it was apparent that Master Chief’s newest adventure affords the option of a familiar action-packed “golden path.” Like nearly all previous Halo games, Infinite’s mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure, a defined and engaging narrative, and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter. Based on the extensive demo I experienced, players looking for that classic Halo campaign structure won’t be disappointed.
However, the alternative path through the game sets Halo Infinite apart from what has come before. After an i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, Halo Infinite is almost here. On December 8, gamers around the world will once again step into the Mjolnir boots of Master Chief and fight their way across a massive Halo ring world. Ahead of the game’s arrival, we’re highlighting Halo Infinite with one of our biggest cover stories in years. We’ve got 20 pages of in-depth detail on Infinite’s campaign and multiplayer, alongside a wealth of interviews with the development team at 343 Industries that brought the game to life.
We checked out the first three hours of the new game, finding out about new weapons, equipment, and upgrades. We finally learned about the freeform open world-style content fleshing out Master Chief’s adventures on Zeta Halo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Switch port of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was announced during the Nintendo Direct that aired back in September, and finally, after a little over a month of waiting, it’s available for purchase. 
KOTOR was first released on the original Xbox and PC in 2003, and it was later ported to Mac, iOS, and Android devices by Aspyr Media, the studio now heading the PlayStation 5 and PC remake of the classic RPG. Due to Xbox’s overall backward compatibility support, the original version of KOTOR has been playable on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S consoles. As of today, it’s playable on Switch.

To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I'm very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don't talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by 'Bath's Nic Cage', and discuss the time he turned on Bath's Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you're all proud of us. We're showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expect a handful of cheats to be missing from Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. 
The GTA franchise is known for a lot of things, including cheats. These allow players to customize the experience in a given GTA game to their liking. Maybe they have too much police heat on them? A cheat can fix that. Maybe they need a rocket launcher immediately? A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. 
However, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. 
“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” 
USA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy. Perhaps players will soon be discovering new cheats as the remastered trilogy launches today.
While waiting for it to go live, read about how GTA: San Andreas is in development for Oculus Quest 2 and then check out the full music roster for GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Bright Memory: Infinite has one thing, it’s bombast. It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

Bright Memory: Infinite feels like an interactive cheesy sci-fi action movie, for better or worse. It boasts incredible – and wonderfully improbable – action sequences propelled by a story that barely qualifies as narrative. Infinite even has a run time that is comparable to some films. Unfortunately, Bright Memory: Infinite burns out before it fades away, peaking early and showing great promise before concluding sooner than expected.

Naruto’s fluid animation, impressive world-building, and relatable heroes have inspired fans across the globe. At the same time, Fortnite is beloved for its constant content rollouts and unexpected crossovers, with Marvel and DC being primary sources of inspiration. However, it’s rare for anime to make an appearance in the cartoonish battle royale’s gameplay loop. Yet, somehow it makes sense for two heavyweights like Naruto and Fortnite to come together. According to a teaser Tweet, Naruto (Shippuden, to be exact) will ninja run into Fortnite next week. Believe it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few games shook the industry or even pop culture like Grand Theft Auto III did in 2001. Coming from seemingly nowhere, it quickly grew from cult hit to mainstream sensation. Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re someone looking for a PlayStation 5 in time for the gift-giving season, or even before the end of March, it’s now going to be even harder. 
Buying a PS5 already feels like an arduous task. Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million. 
Click here to watch embedded media


Bloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. 
The PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues. Now, the PS5 is lagging behind the PlayStation 4. 
While waiting for more PS5s to become available, read about how Nintendo is going through a similar struggle, having cut its Switch production output down by 20% due to production issues.

There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battlefield has always been the largest, loudest, and most chaotic multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the Texas of video games, and whether you love it or hate it, its bombast cannot be overstated. For better and worse, Battlefield 2042 continues this trend, offering a dizzying amount of on-screen explosions, firefights, and objectives to capture. The game’s 128-player matches and gargantuan maps guarantee dramatic moments – and some of my favorite gaming clips from 2021 – but there’s a thin line separating spectacle and confusion. 
There’s never been a Battlefield game released without Conquest, the signature mode which tasks two opposing teams to capture and defend objective zones across the map. The popular match format is alive and well, but honestly, it’s my least favorite w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you tell me your weird take on a free idle game is about 40 minutes long, I'm going to pay attention. I may not have places to go or people to see, but I do have a lot of stuff to do (like the mandatory watching of videos about correct neutral chair posture at work). Then your browser game turns out to be a strange, sort of post-apocalypse thing about music, dancing and weird rural traditions - and harvesting a lot of corn - and I will be crouched on my chair, slavering like a little cider-swilling urchin, for the entirity of those 40 minutes.
Such a creature am I for Peter Talisman: Lord Of The Harvest, a game that fills your screen with a huge field of gently swaying corn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re excited to see if you gel with The Gunk, you won’t have to wait much longer now as Image & Form Games have revealed its release date: December 16. 
The team behind the SteamWorld franchise first announced its upcoming exploration game, The Gunk, during the Xbox Games Showcase back in 2020. Image & Form Games went quiet with The Gunk for about a year before it stepped back into the spotlight (and out of the gunk) during the Xbox Gamescom 2021 stream held in August. There, it was revealed that the Xbox-exclusive title would be released this December.

Now, we know it’s releasing December 16 thanks to a new blog post from the team. 
“We’re so excited to finally reveal the release date of The Gunk, our highly anticipated Xbox exclusive from the creators of the SteamWorld franchise,” the post reads. “Get stuck into The Gunk on December 16 – for anyone subscribed to Game Pass, it’s launching day and date on the service.” 
As noted above, The Gunk will be available on launch day for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. When players jump into it, they’ll experience what the Image & Form Games team describes as a “third-person action adventure game about a duo of gritty space haulers, Rani and Becks, struggling to make a buck as they chance upon a mysterious planet laden with a wealth of natural resources.” It’s on that planet that they discover what’s known as the gunk, which is damaging the planet – however, said gunk is worth a lot of money and the duo must determine what’s more important to them.  
While waiting for The Gunk to be released next month, read about this other Image & Form Games title, SteamWorld Headhunter, which was just announced during the Thuderful Games showcase.

The teaser (which you can watch below) features two robotic cowboys featuring spectacular 'staches facing off in a familiar pistol dueling position. You know, desert town, high noon, and all of that. One automaton looks to have lost the shootout, and in the process, lost his head. When the victor checks on the deceased's condition, only to find its head is detached and flying at him with deadly intent.

Thunderful isn't saying much about Headhunter other than it's a direct follow-up to "the (literally) earth-shattering events of SteamWorld Dig 2" and will be a full 3D, co-op action adventure experience. In honor of the announcement of Headhunter, SteamWorld Dig 2 is currently free to download on Steam and GOG starting today and lasting until tomorrow, November 11 at 11 a.m. Eastern. 
What do you think of the teaser for SteamWorld Headhunter? Are you interested in seeing more of the surface world, or would you prefer to dig into the depths of the planet some more? Shovel your thoughts into the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing can escape the gravitational pull of February 2022. Not even Valve and its upcoming handheld Steam Deck. The company has announced the initial wave of devices that were supposed to ship out in December will now have a targeted February ship date.
The delay is due to the global supply chain issues plaguing many businesses heading into the holiday season. Here's Valve's announcement of the shifted timeline and its reasoning why in full:
It looks like Steam Deck reservations that were due later will also be affected. Keep an eye on your Steam account if you've pre-ordered one already.
While it's disappointing to have to wait the extra couple of months, two months isn't a lot longer to wait. Hopefully, this will give Valve the time needed to gather the proper components and ship these bad boys out to the gaming public. 
The Steam Deck was announced in July promising a device capable of bringing your entire Steam library on the go in a compact Switch-like form factor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spider-Man swings exclusively into the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers on November 30. Developer Crystal Dynamics finally gave us our first look at the wall-crawler’s design, as well as announcing a trailer set to debut tomorrow, November 11.
As you can see in the image above, Spider-Man pretty much looks like Spider-Man. He’s got subtle unique features such as a black grip on the gloves but he doesn’t look much different than his traditional design or what previous alterations have done. We’re not complaining; we’re happy to see Spidey in his familiar glory. 
Spidey joins the fray via the free "With Great Power" hero event. Billed as neither an Operation (like Kate Bishop/Hawkeye) or an expansion (like War for Wakanda), it's tough to know how big of an event this will be. The story focuses on Peter Parker uncovering a new threat and joining the Avengers to stop AIM from procuring dangerous, and mysterious, technology. Used to flying solo, Pete struggles with the dynamic of working on a team and we’ll see if he joins the Avengers full time or remains on his own by the end. Crystal Dynamics says the first trailer will premiere via IGN sometime tomorrow. 
For non-PlayStation players, a big update also launches November 30 that adds a new four-player raid against Klaw, a power cap increase, and the arrival of the loot box-style Shipments. You can read more details about those additions and more here. You can also read about Square Enix's disappointment in Avengers' performance here.

        <updated>2021-11-10T18:31:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Industry figure Geoff Keighley has revealed that his annual gaming awards show, aptly titled The Game Awards 2021, will feature somewhere between 40 to 50 games. 
This news comes by way of a news post by Epic Games about the awards show and in it, Keighley revealed that he learned from last year’s event that “games and the trailers” are what drive the show. He also revealed that this year’s show will focus more on said games (and presumably trailers) and less on featured celebrities and musical performances. 
“You know, it’s great to have celebrities, it’s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,” Keighley said. “Especially this year, there’ll be a lot of content for 2022 and 2023 that will be showing us our kind of biggest lineup yet of world premieres and announcements. What we learned last year was as that end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.” 
Keighley continued and revealed his Game Awards hand a bit, stating that he expects to feature 40 to 50 games “some way or another” this year. He then added that the number of new games announced during the show will probably be in the double digits. 
The Game Awards as a whole have drawn criticism from some in the gaming community as being more focused on the game announcements and trailers rather than the actual awards handed out, but it seems that in Keighley’s eyes, they’re necessary in order to put on the show itself. 
This year’s awards show will be held in-person, as opposed to last year’s mostly virtual event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They’ll air on Thursday, December 9. 
While waiting for the show, check out all of the winners from last year’s Game Awards show and then read about how The Game Awards 2020 broke an impressive viewership record after that.

As previously revealed, the controls have been revamped to match Grand Theft Auto V’s. Shooting and targeting have been improved, including better drive-by controls for San Andreas specifically. You can also now immediately restart failed missions instead of being kicked…]]></summary>

It saw new titles like Far Cry 6, Back 4 Blood, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and more hit the market. It’s no surprise that many of these debuts lead PlayStation’s top downloads for the month of October, either. 
PlayStation released the top October downloads for its multiple platforms today and at the number one spot in the United States and Canada is Far Cry 6, followed by FIFA 22 in second, and Back 4 Blood in third. On the EU side of things, it’s a touch different: to nobody’s surprise, FIFA 22 was the top download with Far Cry 6 in second and Back 4 Blood in third.

I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward.

You defeat eight gym leaders, conquer the elite four (or whatever other monikers that a specific region might use), and then enter the annals of the Pokémon Hall of Fame. Beyond this, you might unlock a new area with challenge battles/scenarios, or, in the case of Gold and Silver, you travel to an entirely new region with its own trainers and points of interest. 
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will likely come with some impressive extra features after the credits roll. Moreover, a new trailer and press release revealed Ramanas Park, an endgame nature preserve of sorts where you can catch legendaries from across the entire franchise.

For three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend's PS5 (that I, err, 'borrowed', as sadly Elden Ring's closed network test isn't available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.

If you elected to get into the test, I hope you get in. First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way – this text contains lots of information and lots and lots of spoilers.

Anime and brawler fans alike came together to either relive their favorite battles/fantasy fights across myriad series or embark on a new, ambitious fighting experience touting a sizable roster at release. I might not have purchased Jump Force when it launched back in 2019, but I remember throwing together A Short Bio Of Every Jump Force Character as a Game Informer intern. I was impressed with the sheer amount of licensed anime shows that were slated to appear in the game (and exhausted by the end of writing all those dossiers).

As technology evolved, so did the scope of digital worlds. Now players are regularly treated to expansive environments filled with quests, interesting characters, and horizons that stretch further with every console generation. These experiences consume dozens if not hundreds of hours, and as more of them flood the market, knowing which titles are worth the time investment has become crucial. To that end, we’ve assembled a list of 10 great modern open-world games available today to help make what can be a paralyzing decision a little easier.

I have never hated a game that I also find immensely fun, but somehow Riders Republic pulled this off. Ubisoft's open-world action sports game begins with a promising premise: you, a voiceless action sports aficionado, arrive at Riders Ridge, a mecca for shredders everywhere. Somehow, against all laws of national parks and state regulations, multiple states' worth of national parks –  including Mammoth and Yosemite – have been reappropriated by the action sports industry for the explicit purpose of hauling ass.

And you have to undertake it several times! The packing, the unpacking, the stuffing of old newspaper in gaps between fragile plates: it's all hell. And comes with the creeping realisation that your life has as much meaning as can be physically stuffed into a few cardboard boxes.
An extra special high-five, then, to Unpacking, which not only makes this stressful event a delightful puzzle, but also demonstrates that your life and things actually have incredible meaning.

Opak je ale pravdou, podporu AVX-512 je možné softwarově zapnout, jediné co je pro to potřeba, je vypnutí úsporných x86 jader (značených E).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You could argue Playground Games have just made essentially the same game at least three times in a row with Forza Horizon now, but while every previous edition had a few things you could point at to show how it was imperfect, you can’t do that here. Forza Horizon 5 is as close to flawless as any racer has ever come. For this level of quality to successfully cover such a massive and ambitious game world is a monumental achievement and should be celebrated with some kind of festival. A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.

These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey podcast fans. Mum’s away this week, which means the inmates have taken over the asylum once again. The temptation was to play another round of Sweeten The Deal, but instead Nate and I were good little podcast boys and delivered a surprisingly on point discussion of our favourite videogame adaptations of literary works. Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.
There’s also a micro Cavern of Lies in which things get biblical.

Amazon say they've banned many players who were spamming chat advertising their illicit services. They also blasted a blog post talking about many of the issues concerning players, explaining things, detailing plans for fixes, and other welcome news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll admit I misjudged Forza Horizon 5 – not just the extent to which I’d enjoy it, but how much its searingly shiny visuals could justify the significantly heightened PC requirements. Well, lock me in one of this game’s hundreds of boots and take me away, because it’s both tonnes of fun and genuinely, magnificently gorgeous. Here’s how Forza Horizon 5 runs on PC, and which settings to tweak if you want a performance boost without cutting too deep into that top-notch fidelity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software and Bandai Namco have treated us to a new Elden Ring gameplay trailer, which showed off 15 glorious minutes of exploration. All I wanted was one laugh and I got it, from a rotund POT-BOY at that. Plus, it was narrated by a guy who sounded suspiciously like SoulsTuber VaatiVidya as the Tarnished trotted and fought and summoned and stealthed. Undoubtedly a showstopper of a trailer, but the higlight for me was how good the action sounded. And boy, it sounded good didn't it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're not too busy fawning over that new Elden Ring gameplay trailer (I don't blame you, it's very exciting), then I have some more exciting Soulsborne news for you - a PlayStation 1-esque demake of Bloodborne is coming out in January next year, and it looks excellent. Bloodborne PSX turns FromSoft's gothic action-RPG into a low-poly spookfest, complete with crackly old sound effects and 16-bit music.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darkest Dungeon 2, the sequel to Red Hook Studio's gothic roguelike, is a somewhat familiar affair. It's dark, it's tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we're leaving the Ancestor's squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they're excited to be working in early access again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is a free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO that came out to great acclaim in Korea back in 2018. Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we've had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon's own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

But Arte's upcoming puzzling game, How To Say Goodbye, looks like a refreshingly playful take on loss. Not to mention that it’s a feast for the eyes. I mean, just LOOK at it.

It will present you with some of your fave maps from the likes of Bad Company 2 and the Battlefields of old, then let you tweak them as much as you please by adding various vehicles, rules and more. I'm personally hoping to see plenty of oldies with 2042's sweet new grappling hook thrown in. Every map could be improved by a grappling hook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now you’ve probably heard about how Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs shake up the previously stagnant Core line. Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.
