        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you progress through Luma Island's main campaign, you'll uncover numerous blueprints. However, some, like the Flour Mill, are hidden behind specific prerequisites. So, if you're eager to unlock the Flour Mill blueprint, here's the path to your next farming triumph.


How to unlock Flour Mill blueprint in Luma Island


The Flour Mill blueprint unlocks from the Cook Profession. You can access this career during the game's beginning stages, where you can purchase a Profession Permit for free. But, if you have already gotten ahold of a different job, you can still buy another permit for 500 gold the second time. Afterward, it'll cost you 10,000 gold for any additional careers, and there's no limit on how many you buy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Angelina vs Rosemonde Kouassi Showdown SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can obtain one/couple of special cards for your Ultimate Team squad. 


The latest Showdown SBC features an upcoming NWSL contest between the Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit. Both items will be eligible for future upgrades based on the result of the contest, so let's take a look at how you can unlock the cards to make them part of your Ultimate Team squads. 


EA FC 25 Angelina vs Rosemonde Kouassi Showdown SBC tasks


The Angelina vs Rosemonde Kouassi Showdown SBC are having two special challenges. Both challenges have two tasks, and here are their conditions. 


Angelina Showdown SBC


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 2 - Brazil



Min. 1 Players from: Brazil


Min. Team Rating: 83



Rosemonde Kouassi Showdown SBC


Task 1 - 82-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 83



EA FC 25 Angelina vs Rosemonde Kouassi Showdown SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete both challenges for cheap. 


Angelina Showdown SBC


Task 1 - Top Form



Any 10  82-rated items


Any 80-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - Brazil



Any 9 83-rated items


Casemiro 84


Any 81-rated item



Rosemonde Kouassi Showdown SBC


Task 1 - 82-Rated Squad



Any 10 82-rated items


Any 80-rated item



Task 2 - Top Form



Any 10 83-rated items


Any 82-rated TOTW item



Both items are expensive in their existing ratings and overall. However, one of them will receive a +2 upgrade, which will make them a bargain at the current completion price. My bet will be on Angelina, but the last two Showdowns have ended in ties, which means they will end up with a +1 upgrade each.

Usually, fodder challenges are easy to complete, and you can finish most of them for free. While the rewards aren't always great, it's not the case. Completing the challenge will reward you with a Rare Players Pack, which usually costs 50,000 coins. Let's look at how you can complete the latest fodder challenge.

The only difficult part of this challenge is the chemistry requirement, which might be slightly tricky. Hence, you can always use the market to get a few items that will help you to complete this fodder challenge.

Odgaard ST 73


Dorgu LM 64


Pickett CM 72


Weatherbolt CM 77


Kastanos RM 73

As I said, you'll get a Rare Players pack. This pack includes 12 player items, with all of them being Rare. One of them is guaranteed to be rated 83 or higher, and chances are that you could end up with a promo item/walkout after completing the challenge. 


Hence, make sure to complete the SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. You can also save the reward pack for upcoming promos. Rumors have it that the FC Pro Live promo is coming soon, and it will have some amazing items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flint is a useful resource in Towers of Aghasba as it is needed to make all sorts of important crafts in the game. Here's where you can find it in abundance.


How to find Flint in Towers of Aghasba


At the start of the game, Flint is an unobtainable resource because you need to craft yourself a Pickaxe to start harvesting it. A bit into the main story, you'll be given the recipe to craft a Stone Pickaxe via the Craft menu. This menu can be accessed and used from anywhere in the world.


To craft a Stone Pickaxe, you'll need Stone, Stick, and Fiber in specific amounts:

2 x Stick - Picked up off the ground.


3 x Stone - Picked up off the ground.


2 x Fiber - Harvested from wild bushes on the ground



Once you have your Stone Pickaxe made, you now can gather Flint. Flint is harvested from Boulders found scattered around the wilderness.

The amount you obtain depends on the quality of the Pickaxe you use. With the Stone Pickaxe, you'll only obtain about one or two per boulder, but there are always plenty of them scattered around.


What is Flint used for in Towers of Aghasba


Screenshot by Destructoid


Flint is used to create several useful items, and you'll need a lot of it throughout your time in Towers of Aghasba. Early on, you'll use it to craft early-game weapons such as Spears and Arrows. You'll also use it to create basic tools/structures like the Construction Table and Standard Mining Hut. Flint, as a material, may become less valuable as your technology advances, but it is still a highly useful resource worth stockpiling.

They come directly from the King of the mysterious Capital and involve shipping items out of town. Effectively, Crown Requests turn you into a one-man export business.

While he may seem aloof initially, it’s easy to see why this “fixer-upper” catches the eye of so many players.

The best way to build up your friendship and eventual romantic connection with any villager, Sebastian included, is to learn their favorite gifts and throw them in their general direction whenever the chance arises. However, it can be hard to do this when a villager’s movements appear completely unpredictable. 


Thankfully, each villager has a set schedule, so you can track their movements throughout the year. If you want to buy Sebastian’s love with daily gifts, here’s how you can find him at any time.

It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

It’s been a stellar year for RPGs on the Switch, with even Mario managing to squeak out three of his own within 12 months and a heavily anticipated remake of a Famicom classic hitting shelves this month with Dragon Quest III Remake. But among all these heavy hitters, be sure not to overlook the humble 8-Bit Adventures 2, as it’s possibly among the same ranks for the right player.
Developer by Critical Games, and a sequel to — you guessed it — the original 8-Bit Adventures, this is a love letter to classic titles like Chrono Trigger, Mother 3, and even (as noted by the developer) Final Fantasy X - heartfelt influences the game wears on its sleeve with pride.

For those wanting to quantify the performance difference between eight and twelve memory channels with AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" processors, here are some benchmarks for showing the workloads that can really benefit from all 12 memory channels and other workloads where eight memory channels can be largely sufficient if looking to minimize costs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Black Friday gaming deals have already started to roll out ahead of the festive season, and you can make the most of it by picking up at least a few Ubisoft titles to make the most out of your potential savings.


The French gaming giants currently have a website-wide sale, and there are huge discounts across different games. From recent launches to older titles, there's a wide array of choices for you to pick. Whether it's for your collection or to gift to a loved one, the current Black Friday gaming deals are too good to miss.


Best Ubisoft Black Friday Gaming deals


Almost every available game on the website is currently having a discount, and here are some of my top picks. These picks aren't ranked in any order, and you can pick the one you like.



Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora ($28 instead of $69.99) - A pretty great deal considering the age of the game. It isn't an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but the discount makes it worth your time and energy (and wallet).


Assassin's Creed Mirage ($20 instead of $49.99) - My favorite Assassin's title in the last ten years, and the discount makes it an even better pick.


The Crew Motorfest Deluxe Edition ($24 instead of $79.99) is an underrated racing gem, and the Deluxe edition includes some unique extras.


Riders Republic ($5 instead of $39.99) - A massive discount as part of Black Friday gaming deals on one of the most fun extreme sports simulators on the market.


Anno 1800 ($10 instead of $59.99) - One of the very best town-builders available at a deep discount.



You can further increase your Black Friday gaming deal savings with the loyalty units program if you have previously purchased titles from Ubisoft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest entry in the Shiren the Wanderer series made its way to Nintendo Switch in the west back in February. Now it has its eyes on a PC release, with Spike Chunsoft lining up a Steam launch for this winter.


When Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island first debuted on Switch, it brought some updated features along with it. In addition to some quality of life updates to exploration, the roguelike made it even easier to stream with an enhanced Live Display Mode.


All of the free feature updates will be available on the Steam version when it launches. Spike Chunsoft also plans to bring the Plus Pack — paid DLC that introduces 10 new dungeons and more — to Steam.

If the music of Shiren the Wanderer has you tapping your toes through each dungeon, the digital soundtrack is also coming to Steam soon. Spread across three discs, the soundtrack includes a whopping 109 tracks that span 330 minutes of jam time. The Serpentcoil Island soundtrack will also be available on iTunes, YouTube Music, and other platforms through noisycroak Records. 


As for the aforementioned free update features, they include more dungeons and playable characters. You'll be able to tackle the six new dungeons and the playable Kokatsu Shiren and Tatsumi Shiren from the start. If you're a fan of roguelikes, there's a lot to chew on in what serves as a pretty solid entry into the wider Shiren series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the rabid world of Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, your guns/weapons will also erode over time if you don't take good care of them.


While there are over 30 weapons present inside the game, you'll want to repair your guns to preserve them. To do so, you'll want to find Technicians who are present inside the Zone. Interacting with them will help you to repair the damage your weapons might have taken on your adventures.


How to find a Technician in Stalker 2


You will be able to find a Technician in settlements. The earliest place you'll be able to find one is in Zalissya. Once you've survived the first set of monstrosities in the Zone, you will meet someone named Lens. He will be located in the building next to Warlock's Bar, and he will repair your weapon's durability in exchange for money.


Interact with Lens to open the Technician menu and pick a weapon that has broken. You'll be able to repair the gun if you have the required resources.

Should you repair weapons in Stalker 2


I personally believe that it's better to let your weapons go unrepaired when you're just getting started. Except for the Skif's Pistol, all weapons cost money to repair. Once you've completed the first upgrade, Skif's Pistol will also cost money to repair.


Repairing will have made sense, but you can also find new weapons in the world. Just switching them will be a far more convenient option and save your resources in the process. However, feel free to repair one if it becomes your favorite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kingdom Hearts 2 Timeless River world has always been black and white as it's inspired by the first Disney cartoon Steamboat Willie. However, the world received a Technicolor mod on Saturday that gives it a colorful tone. 


Created by danimalforlife on Nexusmods, all of the character models and the world's environments are in color. Sora wears his signature red outfit from the first game, while Donald and Goofy are in their classic blue and green get-ups. As the trailer that danimalforlife has showcased demonstrates, it's quite a vast difference from the original black and white look. 


"Everything from the textures, to journal history, to pictures, has been given color," explains the modder in the Nexusmods listing. 




This mod is only available to PC players. You'll need to use KHPCPatchManager and OpenKH to turn on this Technicolor style in Timeless River. Thankfully, Nexusmods claims that the files are clean, as the virus scan claims they are "safe to use." Nevertheless, this Kingdom Hearts 2 Timeless River mod is impressive for those who love the beloved Disney series.


Recently, Steamboat Willie has been claimed as fair use. This means that anyone can use the assets of the cartoon for their project. However, it may get tricky as you have to specifically use this version of Mickey and not the modern interpretation. 


Some games have taken the old-school animation art style and made them their own. Cuphead successfully grabbed the attention of many with its difficult gameplay and eye-popping art style that looks ripped from the early 20th century. Mouse: P.I. For Hire is also going old-school with black and white graphics with a first-person shooter. It's inspired by the hand-drawn rubber hose animation and jazz soundtracks of the era. It releases sometime in 2025.

Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Dawn meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a shocking and slightly confusing turn of events, Final Fantasy XIV has announced that there is a mobile version of the incredibly popular MMO on the way. It's officially licensed by Square Enix, but being developed by Lightspeed Studios. 


I have to admit, FFXIV Mobile wasn’t exactly at the top of my wishlist or expectations for 2024, but this is not an entirely unexpected announcement. Back in August, a leaked document revealed the title on a list of licensed games heading to China. This official announcement is simply confirmation that it will also be headed to the west at some point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re probably all past "And in the game" jokes by now, but it is fitting that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl is about venturing into a shattered world and enduring the worst of its logic-defying hardships to find the treasures within. This is a bold, uncompromising survival FPS that can easily capture you for days on end – but I can’t invite you back into the Zone without hammering in a few hundred warning signs reading "DANGER: BUGS". In Ukrainian, obviously.

A new report from Reuters has emerged that reveals Sony is potentially in talks to purchase Kadokawa, a Japanese media conglomerate that serves as parent to dozens of entertainment companies.
In the gaming space, Kadokawa owns Spike Chunsoft, Acquire, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and FromNetworks, while also owning a majority stake in FromSoftware alongside Tencent and Sony. We imagine that FromSoftware is proving particularly attractive for Sony, since the studio is responsible for the likes of Elden Ring, Bloodborne, Dark Souls, and the Armored Core franchise.

One of the biggest surprises in Nintendo's storied history came in June 2021 when Metroid Dread was finally unveiled for the Switch. Up until that point, the game had fallen into legend, with many fans conceding that it simply didn't exist.
One of the most significant catalysts for fan anticipation came via Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, released for the Wii in 2007. Although series producer Yoshio Sakamoto had already been attempting to create a sequel to Metroid Fusion, with apparent evidence cropping up via internal documents, it was Retro Studios' third Prime entry that really set pulses racing. A piece of lore from the game stated "Experiment status report update. Metroid project 'Dread' is nearing the final stages of completion".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2015 a flight by Germanwings carrying 144 passengers and six crew crashed into a mountain in the French Alps. Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: "I hope this hurts."

Remember back in September when Warner Bros. revealed the first trailer for the Minecraft Movie and everyone lost their minds because it didn't look great? Well, the second full-length trailer is now here and it looks... better? We guess.
Prepare yourselves, folks, it looks like the live-action adaptation will feature some Steve lore. The trailer kicks off with a peek at Steve's backstory — "As a child, I yearned for the mines", heh — showing us how Jack Black's protagonist got to the blocky world in the first place. At least, it kinda explains it. There's only so much realism you can pour into a product like Minecraft at the end of the day.

We checked for more codes.




In SU, playing on private servers is the only way to play certain game modes and fully customize your experience. However, they aren't cheap, and instead of creating one, you can join a server that already exists. To do that, you'll need the Shonen Unleashed private server codes we listed right below.

Keep in mind that whoever enters a private server in case it's empty gets to be the admin of it until the owner of the PS enters it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If rumors are to be believed, the FC Pro Live promo is returning to EA FC 25, and the entire team has been supposedly leaked online.


This promo made its Ultimate Team debut last year, and it seems to be returning this time before the start of the FC Pro Open. EA Sports has remained tight-lipped, and as of this writing, there's no hint about which campaign is coming next after Track Stars. However, the rumors have shed light on which footballers might be getting special cards as part of the upcoming promo.


Complete list of EA FC 25 FC Pro Live player leaks


Here are all the cards expected to be part of the upcoming promo. (Leak courtesy of @AsyFutTrader)



Sam Morsy


Lorenzo Insigne


Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain


Jérôme Roussillon


Emil Forsberg


Nathan Aké


Nawaf Al Abed


Stian Gregersen


Gabriel Jesus


Exequiel Palacios


Igor Silva


Xavi Simons


Hassan Tombakti


Ryan Gravenberch


Sacha Boey


Ramon Hendriks


Fábio Carvalho


Jamie Bynoe-Gittens


Federico Redondo


Karim Benzema


Wout Weghorst


Sofyan Amrabat


Victor Osimhen


Ferdi Kadıoğlu



If the FC Pro Live promo works similarly this year, all the items will be live cards. In simpler words, they will be recipients of stat, playstyle, and, potentially, role upgrades in the future. The cards will be represented by the athletes who will participate in the FC Pro Open tournament.


While a bulk of the items arrived in packs last year, a few were also released as SBCs. They may follow the same pattern this time around, and it will be interesting to find out more about the promo in the upcoming days.

And yet, I persevered, booting it back up and returning to my government-mandated shift atop a quiet mountain.
Ultimately, I gave Threshold chance after chance because I was totally taken by my shift and my immense desire to find out just what I was actually doing. Anyway, it's time for me to clock off! I urge you to take over until I'm back. It's worth it.

Developed once again by Asobo - otherwise celebrated for their stinking rat hordes - it builds upon the 2020 game by "[taking] advantage of the latest technologies in simulation, cloud, machine learning, graphics and gaming", in the words of the launch announcement release.
We've got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of "machine learning" technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off.

Yes, LEGO Horizon Adventures has let Aloy and co. out of the Sony playground and onto Nintendo systems for the first time, and now it's your chance to let us know what you make of it.
The game launched last week, shrinking the action-adventure series into the brick-based shenanigans we'd expect from a LEGO title. There's approachable combat, light-hearted comedy, heaps of customisation and (rather surprisingly) it's all wrapped up in a visually stunning package on Switch.

If you've been a part of the Nintendo gaming community for a while, then chances are you're well acquainted with 'DK Rap', the charming introductory theme tune seen in 1999's Donkey Kong 64. It's gained significant notoriety and love over the years, though many fans do concede that the song isn't actually that good.
Well, it's good now, folks. Almost 25 years after its debut, DK Rap has been remade, courtesy of original composer Grant Kirkhope and rapper Substantial, bringing it fully up to date, albeit with one eye firmly on the past. Indeed, one commenter on the YouTube video said it had been given the '3rd Strike' treatment, and we have to agree with this assessment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I've never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot 'em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: "ah, that was good."
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, the company behind music streaming app Musi sued Apple for breach of contract, following the removal of its app from the App Store. Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision.

It's like the "glass half empty" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the "bar", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. "A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please," I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha "prelude": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve "bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards" or risk "intense scrutiny" from the government.

In brief: they've recorded developer commentary; they've added Steam Workshop support; Episodes One and Two are now part of the package; and there are some bug fixes and new graphics options.

Grab it before the end of the weekend (November 18th at 6pm GMT) and it's also free to keep on Steam.

It was also complaint-provoking in the fairly long period where I didn't understand what it's trying to do. Reaching that point, luckily for you, means we can cut out a lot of the "confused whingeing" subsection of those notes. Though it still has its shortcomings, I've come to appreciate that I was reading Kingdoms all wrong. Although it talks big about characters, politics, and religion, they're not what it's about. It's about building.

It's part of a "restructuring" that'll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in a press release yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it's an intentional move that'll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers.

At this point it's clear that they can either choose Nintendo, or Switch emulators, but they can't have relationships with both. At least not in public. During the last few hours Nintendo began targeting Pomelo, a popular Switch emulator for iOS devices. Like similar emulators before it, Pomelo's disclaimer against piracy is redundant. Thanks to its family tree, it has nowhere left to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been 'out' of strategy autobattler Mechabellum since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back in September. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as "a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Rue Valley you role play a guy with poor mental health. He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say "lol, it me" with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter "ugh, it me" and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: running away is the best feeling in videogames. More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap "should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it." But do you?

Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you'll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I've found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as "co-developers" on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is facing criticism in Spain and Italy for alleged anti-piracy failures. The latest claim accuses Google of ignoring notices that aim to remove pirate IPTV providers from search results. So here's the thing: why would a company take down 10 billion URLs from search but suddenly start acting differently? The public labeling of Google as "grossly negligent" deserves context too; two weeks ago, Google's diligence prevented one of its accusers from deindexing its own website.

"I didn’t even know what a Neo-Volkite pistol was until five minutes ago, but now this whole game is trash until I get one!." As promised in the roadmap, the last big update added a whole new Operations map, complete with a gargantuan new pseudo-boss in the form of a hierophant bio-titan. It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

The game is launching a "Classic" mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first Overwatch launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

As reported by Polygon, that's an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of The Crew. They're suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the racing game's servers, rendering it unplayable.

The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children's book about a nice elephant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After DAZN received a warning for the blunder that saw Google Drive blocked in Italy, a company behind a smart TV video player app had a DAZN-initiated blocking decision revoked after a successful appeal.

"This" has changed a lot over time: from producing CD and DVD coverdiscs, to writing for a magazine, to editing magazines and a website, to solely editing a website, to managing several websites. Sprinkle podcasts, videos, events and a lot of other things in there and "games journalist" doesn't really cover it. 

One of the only constants is that I read a lot of writing about video games. 

Dapper gent Oli Welsh wrote for Polygon about the fan reboot of City Of Heroes. We briefly covered fans getting an official license earlier this year, but Oli went and spoke to the folks making it all work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.

There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GeForce Now, Nvidia’s PC-focused game streaming service, will begin calling time on its most muscular of power users. A post on the GFN subreddit announced the introduction of a 100-hour monthly cap (or "allowance"), effective from January 1st 2025 for anyone who signs up after that date. Existing streamists, or anyone who signs up by the end of 2024, will get a year’s grace period before the limit kicks in from January 2026.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could tower defence be the ultimate "it's Friday and I am here in body only" genre? I haven't really thought about it before, but Rift Riff's effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new open world game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Putting aside my natural annoyance at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foxhole is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don't play it. It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

True, occasionally my children say things like "I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer", but it is the nature of children to rebel.

Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. "[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets," said creator Eric Barone in a xeet. When asked the lore-accurate cause of this problem, he blamed: "a strange rash".

There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.
You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

Více erudovaný divák si může říkat, že to je odvážná hra s žánry a možná dokonce i nastavování zrcadel něčemu. Každopádně je to originální zážitek, který skoro nenudí a vypadá až překvapivě výpravně (vzhledem k omezenému rozpočtu). (Ilča 100 %)]]></summary>
