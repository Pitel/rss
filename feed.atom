Destructoid has been known for its iconic robot mascot, Mr. Destructoid, for almost two decades, so it's strange that there has never been a list here featuring of the best robots in gaming. Well, today, we are fixing that by talking to you about the most beloved walking and talking machines from throughout gaming history. From a certain lombax's robotic pal to the most adorable cat (that isn't a cat), here are the 10 best robots in gaming, ranked.

Feel like you've played one too many dull Doom clones in your time to really be bothered trying another? Well, may we suggest you get your glad rags on and give Mopeful Games' Fashion Police Squad a whirl, it's absolutely fabulous, darling!
Sashaying onto Switch in a very silly burst of colour and humour, this is a quirky delight of an indie first-person shooter that starts off feeling a little too basic but gradually adds enough components to its core gameplay to make it well worth getting stuck into.

Trading Posts are now live in World of Warcraft, and it might be confusing in terms of discerning what they actually do, and where to find them. Since they're found in separate capital cities, each faction will have to access their own Trading Posts. Here's where to locate them!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOhJEqTBPPY
What are Trading Posts?
Think of Trading Posts as an extra in-game season pass of sorts, opening a new path to more cosmetic items. After logging in on a monthly basis, you'll get 500 currency for the Trading Post.
Here's the full description from Blizzard:
"A new feature is making its way to World of Warcraft on February 1 — the Trading Post! Complete monthly activities to earn currency toward decking out your characters in cosmetic transmogs, pets, and mounts— with new items and activities introduced every month."

[gallery link="file" size="large" ids="360885,360887,360886"]
Where to find the Alliance WoW Dragonflight Trading Post
You'll find the Alliance Trading Post in Stormwind, very close to the Mage Quarter in the southwest portion of the city. Its coordinates are 51.4, 71.7.
A full visual guide can be found in the gallery above.
[gallery link="file" size="large" ids="360888,360889,360890"]
Where to find the Horde WoW Dragonflight Trading Post
You'll find the Horde Trading Post in Orgrimmar, east of the embassy, in the southern portion of the city. Its coordinates are 48.7, 76.4.
A full visual guide can be found in the gallery above.

        <updated>2023-02-01T21:00:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross your fingers and catch them all!
In the early days of the anime, Ditto was a little awkward with its shape-shifting. It could perfectly pull off every other detail except the face! It was almost horrific when the Pokémon would turn around and have this blank face, but at least it was easy to tell that it was Ditto. In the games, this little quirk is not present. If you're searching for a Ditto in Pokémon GO, unfortunately, there's no way to distinguish one in disguise from just a normal Pokémon. So how in the world do you catch one?
Honestly, you just have to get lucky! That's a sucky answer, I know. Unfortunately, you won't know if a Pokémon is a Ditto in disguise until you catch it. Only once it is safely captured in the PokéBall will a little question pop up. Then Ditto's true form will be revealed. Of all of the Pokémon to catch, that has to be the most exciting then!
These tricky little blobs are pretty rare, and their shiny counterparts are even rarer. Don't worry though, a shiny Ditto will not be disguised as a shiny Pokémon. You don't have to be afraid that when you finally catch a shiny you've been looking forward to it will turn out to be a blue blob of putty.
Niantic, the team behind Pokémon GO, doe not release an official list of Pokémon each month that are likely to be the shape-shifter. The whole idea is to have the illusion that it could be any of them. However, some sites, such as IGN, have a running list of likely disguises each month based on anecdotal evidence. People catch Ditto and seem to find monthly patterns, which makes sense from a tech standpoint.
You can't really train Ditto, and it's useless in battles, so you might as well just enjoy the lottery. Maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you won't. If you want more concrete tips on catching Pokémon in the mobile game, we have guides on how to catch Leafeon and Glaceon as well as how to catch Kecleon.

If you're on the lookout for bright and bubbly games about exploring a colourful world and making friends in a small town, then boy is this year a good one for you. But today we're talking about Mika and the Witch's Mountain, a fantasy adventure game about a delivery witch who carts packages around on her broom.
If this gives you Kiki's Delivery Service vibes, then ding ding ding, you nailed it — there's more than a little bit of Ghibli magic built into the DNA of Mika and the Witch's Mountain. But with Wind Waker-like art and a cast of diverse characters to befriend over the course of this coming-of-age journey, there's evidently more than enough of its own special sauce that hundreds of people have already backed the game on Kickstarter less than 24 hours after its launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time for fisticuffs
Something of a hidden gem has finally received an English localization, albeit from fans. Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman Zero (hereby known as Shockman Zero) is an entry in the Shockman series of games. While the series is better known for its entries on the PC-Engine/Turbografx-16, it got its soul Super Famicom release in 1997 via the Satellaview. Over here in the west, we only received Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 2 in 1992 as Shockman, though it later saw re-release on Nintendo’s Virtual Console service on Wii and Wii U.
The Satellaview was an early digital download platform for the Super Famicom, which meant that after that service went offline, the title was no longer available. However, it got re-released in cartridge format via Columbus Circle in 2017. You can still find it available in some places if you’ve got a Super Famicom to stick it in.
[caption id="attachment_360788" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Romhacking.net[/caption]
Shockman Zero is a delicious mix of Mega Man-style platformer and beat-’em-up. It’s as if the Blue Bomber defeated Fist Man and learned to throw hands. It has a distinct Japanese flavor that reminds me of Gunstar Heroes. It’s also a co-op, so you can smite baddies with a friend.
The translation comes courtesy of homebrewers Svambo and Anonymousse However, as this was a Japanese-only release previously, this might be the closest we ever get to an official translation. That is, unless a publisher wants to assemble all these games in a collection, which you could absolutely count me on board for. Stranger things have happened, like the upcoming Jajamaru Collections, for example.

PQube has announced that it will be handling the western release of Inti Creates' Gothic Gals with Guns actioner Grim Guardians: Demon Purge — The publisher will launch the cool-looking title digital on consoles on February 24, with a range of physical releases also in the works.
Standard boxed editions of Demon Purge will be made available on PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch platforms this spring, while a special Collector's Edition is expected to launch in summer 2023. This latter edition will include a boxed physical edition of the game on PlayStation or Switch, alongside a 40-page artbook, a sticker set and key ring, art cards, and even a fun origami set, representing the magic of our monster-mashing Kazimono sisters, Shinobu and Maya.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeN47PDxyiQ&ab_channel=PQube
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is a pixelated 2D adventure that marries a Castlevania's Gothic aesthetic with the run 'n' gun chaos of a Gunvolt. One or two players will lead the Kazimono sisters deep into the dark dungeons of a demonic castle, determined to purge its evil from their village school. Younger sibling Maya will be looking to bring down a battalion of hellish opponents with her lethal *checks notes* origami skills, while her older sister Shinobu is, somewhat more traditionally, going with good old-fashioned lead — delivered accurately and with speed.

Inti Creates' stylish-looking title shifted onto my radar at the end of the era, thanks to its cool pixelated visuals, cheesecake anime style, and interesting mix of magic and bombastic action. I'll be keeping an eye on this one, and I will hopefully find the time and opportunity to check it out for all of you folks right here at the good ship Destructoid. Lock 'n' load... and fold, I guess.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge launches February 24 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

The last time Pokemon Home got a major update was all the way back in October, but as of today, version 2.1.0 has hit mobile devices. This February 1, 2023 update addresses Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, but it doesn't quite add full Home support just yet.
Primarily, it looks at adding ranked battle info in the mix, as well as battle results from Sword & Shield (remember those?!). The catch is that you'll need to link your Home account to a Nintendo account with data from the newest generation: otherwise you won't be able to view said data. This is alongside of the typical "other issues/various fixes" vaguery in many AAA franchise patch notes.
As a reminder, full Scarlet & Violet access is still on track for "spring 2023" according to several listings on The Pokemon Company websites. It can't come soon enough! So far in terms of "off book" Pokemon releases we've gotten Charizard, Cinderace, and Greninja: as well as the full evolutionary lines for all three.
Pokemon Home version 2.1.0 full patch notes:
Added Ranked Battles information from Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to the Battle Data feature.
If you've linked Pokémon HOME to a Nintendo Account with data from Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet, you'll now be able to view results from your Ranked Battles in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.
You can view your battle results from Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield by choosing View Past Battle Records.
Other issues have also been addressed in order to ensure a user-friendly experience.

Hi-Fi Rush occupies an increasingly rare space in the big-budget video game industry: that of colorful, goofy, and light-hearted titles. For its 10 or 11-hour runtime, it has more in common with a Saturday morning cartoon than a thin attempt at gritty, prestige television, like most triple-A games these days, and that's easily its biggest strength. That its gameplay and combat are a unique melding of rhythm and stylish action games is merely the cherry on top.

Devolver Digital has announced that the latest entry in the Shadow Warrior series is getting a glow-up in the form of a definitive edition on February 16. Bringing forth some performance upgrades and new features, Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition could be seen as the next-gen version. Existing owners of Shadow Warrior 3 will be getting a free upgrade to the new version.
Originally released in 2022, Shadow Warrior 3 took series protagonist Lo Wang back to his single-player roots after the more four-player co-op-focused Shadow Warrior 2. While it’s a more linear take than Flying Wild Hog’s previous games in the revival series, it introduced more movement options with dashing and wall-running.

The headlining features are a survival mode, hardcore difficulty, and new game plus. Survival mode unlocks after you’ve beaten the main storyline and offers up some weapon skins if you can, uh… survive. Hardcore difficulty is, as the name suggests, a more challenging way to play through the game. Meanwhile, New Game Plus is a little less clear, with Devolver Digital saying that it allows you to “Enjoy additional challenges, rewards, and skins to give Lo-Wang that much-needed confidence boost.” They haven’t really said if you get to keep your upgrades for the second playthrough.
Along with these additions is hero mode, which introduces a life system to the gameplay. There is also a chapter selection, allowing you to replay your favorite slices of the game.
In terms of stepping up to the current generation of consoles, on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, there will be a performance mode for 60fps gameplay, or you can trade that for 4K visuals and 30fps.
Shadow Warrior 3 is currently available for PC, Xbox One, and PS4. The Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition upgrade will add native PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions to the mix on February 16, 2023.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Scott ponders how Mario's nemesis number 2 deserves more respect...

In the conversation of all-time great video games you have many Nintendo faces who show up near enough every time; Super Metroid, Ocarina of Time, most main-series Super Mario games. And while all of those live up to their high praise and deserve to be mentioned amongst the greats, there are many Nintendo titles that unjustly don't get mentioned in that conversation. Games like Rhythm Paradise Megamix and Kid Icarus: Uprising, which — despite them being tremendous experiences — very rarely make the cut. While I could argue with you over how fantastic those two games are, I’m here to talk about another, which, despite a cult following and even receiving very positive review scores at the time, is rarely brought up in all-timer conversations: Wario Land 4.

New evidence has been uncovered that suggests Billy Mitchell did indeed cheat to attain his record-breaking Donkey Kong scores — the ones which Twin Galaxies removed from its record boards because they were allegedly achieved via emulation rather than original arcade hardware, and for which Mitchell is suing the record-keeping company.
As revealed by Karl Jobst on YouTube in the video at the top of the page, previously unseen photographic evidence shows what appears to be a non-original, potentially eight-way joystick as opposed to the four-way stick of the original cabinet. This difference makes it easier to perform certain moves and would give anyone using it an unfair advantage over someone using original hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh yeaaah, dig it!
The release of WWE 2K23 is fast approaching its March 17, 2023 date with retail, and to get you in the suplexing mood, 2K Sports has released a trailer showing off its WarGames mode. This mode features two rings, side-by-side within a steel cage, and has two teams facing off with each other with three or four members a piece. The members of each team are let into the cage in an alternating fashion, and the winning team is decided by pinfall or submission once everyone is inside.
WarGames started off with Jim Crockett Promotions, which would become WCW. It would continue appearing throughout WCW’s run, which ended in 2001 when WWE (WWF at the time) bought them out. WarGames was then brought back in 2017 with the NXT brand, albeit with some minor changes.

With the inclusion of two rings, this is actually a pretty big addition to the series. I expect to see many limitations in terms of what venue and mode it can be played in, but it could be a fun way to mix up multi-player. I just don’t want to see what the load times look like when you have two teams full of custom wrestlers.
More importantly, though, the trailer shows that “Macho Man” Randy Savage is once again on the roster this year for WWE 2K23. He looks about the same as he did in WWE 2K22, but my enthusiasm for the release would be significantly diminished if he wasn’t in it.
WWE 2K23 will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on March 17, 2023. It will arrive in Standard, Deluxe, and Icon Edition flavors.

The Zelda timeline is a difficult beast to get your head around. There are various different threads with Link at a different stage in his heroism, things that are canon and non-canon and always the promise that the next game could come along and shift everything about (we're looking at you, Tears of the Kingdom).
For the most part, the timeline excludes most of the Zelda spin-off sources (TV shows, manga, graphic novels and the like), though this isn't to say that there are no interesting facts to be gained from these formats. Take the following images from 'The Perfect Zelda Fan Book', a Japanese guide for A Link to the Past which also contains a short manga for the first three games in the series.

The Bunker offers a different spin on the Amnesia formula. Set during World War 1, players control a French soldier who gets separated from his comrades and trapped inside a military bunker. Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares. Check out the original reveal trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a candle in the wind
Microsoft has chosen to remind us of the ephemeral nature of digital games by announcing that they’ll be delisting 46 games from the Xbox 360 Marketplace on February 7th.
Thankfully, most of these titles are already available elsewhere or in a physical format. If they’re available on the Xbox One or Series X|S marketplace, they will remain available there. Also, if you have already purchased them, you will still have access to them after their removal through your download history.
The list of affected games are:
Aegis Wing
Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood
Assassin’s Creed III
Assassin’s Creed IV
Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD
Blood of the Werewolf
Blue Dragon
Breakdown
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
Call of Duty: Ghosts
Castle Crashers
Cloning Clyde
Counter-Strike: GO
Dark Souls
Darksiders II
DAYTONA USA
Defense Grid
Eets: Chowdown
Far Cry 2
Final Fight: Double Impact
Iron Brigade
Jeremy McGrath’s Offroad
Jet Set Radio
Left 4 Dead
Left 4 Dead 2
LIMBO
Lost Odyssey
Mass Effect 2
MONOPOLY DEAL
Mutant Blobs Attack
N+
Outpost Kaloki X
Peggle 2
Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds
Prince of Persia
R.U.S.E.
Sega Vintage Collection: Alex Kidd & Co.
Skate 2
South Park: The Stick of Truth
Spelunky
Splinter Cell: Conviction
Star Wars: Battlefront
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2
The Orange Box
The Raven: Episode 1
The Witcher 2
It’s perhaps not a surprise that Microsoft would eventually look to sunset the Xbox 360 Marketplace, but it’s a sad reality. Better solutions need to be brought forward to preserve digital-only titles. But for now, if you want digital versions of these titles in your library, you’ve got about a week to jump on them.
More details can be found through Microsoft's official support.

If you've been in the biz of reading game reviews for a while, you'll know that an Edge 9/10 is about as rare as a calendar month without a Nintendo Direct rumour. But voxel crate-burning puzzle game Bonfire Peaks managed it, impressing Edge's reviewers with its 100+ puzzles and gorgeous island ruins. Forgive us for not getting our own review up — we must have burned the review crate by accident...
Bonfire Peaks is now getting a three-part DLC pack called Lost Memories, which will be released episodically throughout 2023. Part One, which is roughly a quarter the length of the base game, will arrive on Switch on March 2nd, with the second and third parts following later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA and FIFA set to part ways
Electronic Arts announced its financial earnings for its third quarter of the fiscal year, revealing that the latest, and last, entry in its long-running FIFA franchise, FIFA 23, is on track to be the best-selling release in the franchise's entire history.
Speaking in a conference call, transcribed by VGC, EA CEO Andrew Wilson noted that North American sales of the football sim are up a huge 50% on last year's release, and as such the title is "pacing to be the biggest title in franchise history". As we previously reported, Electronic Arts FIFA 23 had an incredible launch week, racking up an incredible 10.3 million players within one week of its September 30, 2022 launch date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tIW1X2dv0c&vl=en&ab_channel=EASPORTSFIFA
In a strange irony, what could prove to be the most successful Electronic Arts FIFA title of all time will also be the last collaboration between the game publisher and international football's statutory body. As of next year, Electronic Arts will launch its new brand, EA Sports FC, while the Federation Internationale de Football Association itself is hoping to find success with its own football simulation series.
Despite the insistence by FIFA president Gianni Infantino that the new, official FIFA game will be "the only authentic, real game", and "best one available for gamers and football fans", I think we know where the development talent and marketing savvy really lie. And, given the skyrocketing success of FIFA 23, The FIFA federation may soon regret pricing itself out of one of — if not the — most consistently performing franchise in the entire history of video games.
FIFA 23 is available now on  PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

I've been doing the third one for about a year, because it's, I think, six thousand pieces. I say "i think" because it's been long enough that I can't remember if I told the game to generate it as five or six thousand. But it's a lot of thousand.
I really like jigsaws (I am in the middle of doing a real life one that is a big copy of the London Underground map) but, even though I have one of those special mats to do puzzles on so you can fold them away, they're quite inconvenient. At the same time, though, there are very few digi-jigsaws that capture the kind of tactile experience of sifting and sorting through pieces. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams really does, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revisiting Minecraft to discuss whether it deserved the GOTY award back in 2010 is a hard task, in the same way that discussing the importance of sliced bread is hard. It’s so significant that, when ranking the significance of other similar things, we all forget it until someone goes “wait wot about Minecraft” and then everyone unleashes a collective “oooo yeahhh”, guaranteeing it the top spot. To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.
In fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft. If everyone brings one thing, we can have a show-and-tell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane’s co-op, vampire huntin’ shooter is only a couple of months away, but there's some eyebrow-raising news in Redfall land. On top of being a vampire-filled hellscape, Redfall will also require an always-online connection, even when playing the game in single-player without buddies. This comes courtesy of a Bethesda FAQ page that states a “persistent connection is required” for co-op and single-player, and that a Bethesda.net account is also necessary to play the game. Many co-op and multiplayer games have required a persistent connection as of late, but it’s disappointing in Redfall’s case since the game is playable alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I loved Obsidian’s medieval mystery Pentiment when it released last November, and part of my admiration was for its incredible art style. It was like the dev team had nicked a bunch of 16th-century manuscripts, scanned the delicate pages, and then fully animated them to life.
Pentiment was clearly made by a team who had a deep love for the time period, and the same can be said for Inkulinati, a 2D turn-based strategy game that also uses illuminated medieval drawings. But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update 1.03
I haven't really been having much trouble with Dead Space on PS5 (outside of a few times I had to reload checkpoints); but folks have reported issues with stuttering on several platforms, as well as out-there problems like Twitch streaming bugs or various PC graphical anomalies. While the development team is tracking all known issues here, the recent 1.03 patch addresses some problems on PC and PS5 (with Xbox arriving later this week).
EA has been fairly vague with what patch 1.03 fixes exactly, but suffice to say many players have been responding positively to it. This is especially the case on PC, where the option to disable VRS alone has helped the stability of that platform tremendously.
Full Dead Space 1.03 patch notes
Disabling VRS is now possible on PC
Addressed PS5 stuttering
Addressed the black screen bug
General stability and performance fixes
A Dead Space Reddit community member has also provided a workaround for PC stuttering issues, if you're still having them:
Making sure power profile is set to AMD Performance Mode (it stutters on AMD Balanced)
Disabling Exploit Protection in Windows for "Dead Space.exe" (need to add exception)This is very common resolution of stuttering in DX12 games, Horizon Zero Dawn had the same problem.
Disable GPU scheduling (I've checked that during game GPU load is ~90% while CPU is ~60%, so I guess it's fine to do scheduling on CPU)
Disabling Adobe Creative Cloud

Atari has revealed that Akka Arrh, the company's once-lost psychedelic shooter, is launching on Switch on 21st February.

His company Llamasoft is responsible for many Atari games such as Attack of the Mutant Camels, Llamatron, the Tempest series, Gridrunner, and (more recently) multiple iOS and Android titles.

Instead of focusing on one theme and yapping on about it for a very long time, we're now splitting the pod into two segments: the first half on the hip and happening, the second on an FPS genre or subgenre that we're unfamiliar with. Our first port of call? theHunter: Call Of The Wild.
In our first sessions with the game, we both concluded that A) deer are incredibly athletic; and B) we're the most impatient people, perhaps ever. More than that, though, we hadn't realised how important it was to fixate on your prey. Not like, track them down. But like, track them down, you know?

The hype is real. It's official folks, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is only 100 days away at the time of writing, launching on the Nintendo Switch on May 12th, 2023.
We're obviously very excited here at Nintendo Life, and we have lots of hopes and dreams as to what we'd like to see from the direct sequel, including which elements should be brought over from Breath of the Wild, and which should perhaps be left just where they are.

Yesterday, we told you about the upcoming Street Fighter game that's launching on mobile. Today, it's Tomb Raider's turn. Lara Croft is set to return to iOS and Android devices this month with Tomb Raider Reloaded. Featuring the voice talents of Keeley Hawes and a look that harkens back to the golden era of this franchise, Reloaded sees gaming's most famous treasure hunter pillaging more ancient ruins in search of stuff to keep at her mansion. This time around, the locations she'll explore–which include famous locations like St. Francis' Folly and the Lost Valley–are procedurally generated. That's right, this game is a roguelike, and as you can see from the Tomb Raider Reloaded trailer below, it doesn't look too bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU9LTV1qvY0
After having Lara Croft go through more "realistic" adventures, it's nice to see her back doing what she does best: fighting dinosaurs. Developed by Emerald City Games in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics – Eidos, Tomb Raider Reloaded will feature all the acrobatics Lara Croft is known for, as well as classic enemies, traps, and puzzles. Players will be able to upgrade Lara with new equipment and XP, and like every other free-to-play game on mobile, the developers hope to keep you booting the game up daily with events and challenges. Cellist Tina Guo, who was a featured soloist on the Grammy-nominated Journey soundtrack, is spearheading orchestral recordings of classic Tomb Raider songs for the game.
Tomb Raider Reloaded will launch worldwide on February 14, 2023. You can download it for iOS or Android, and if you have a Netflix subscription, you can access the game without any of the ads and microtransactions found in the free-to-play version.

This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days' notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development.

But when Death realises how much his underlings have gone off the rails in his absence, he takes matters into his own bony hands, and undertakes an adventure through the departments of Death Inc. to remind his subordinates who's boss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy is finally out next week, after multiple delays that pushed it out of its original 2021 release date to 2023. And you can prepare the game's release with a new gameplay launch trailer released by developer Avalanche Software today. 
The trailer features roughly two and a half minutes of new Hogwarts Legacy footage, including a mix of both cinematics from the game and gameplay. We see Hogsmeade, professors, students, and plenty of Hogwarts, of course. 
Check it out for yourself in the Hogwarts Legacy launch trailer below: 


"Hogwarts Legacy invites players to embark on an epic journey as a fifth-year student at Hogwarts, gifted with a rare ability to tap into ancient, powerful magic," a press release reads. "Guided by the Wizard's Field Guide and unique instruction from professors and other characters, fans will uncover a compelling storyline filled with thrilling challenges and mysteries."
For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month ,and then watch this cinematic tour of the Hogwarts castle grounds. Check out Hogwarts Legacy's PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that.
Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game), and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4. The Switch version of the game will be released on July 25.]]></summary>

Developer DevM Games has announced that the wacky 3D platformer Super Adventure Hand will be making its way to the Switch later this year, sometime in Q3 2023.
In Super Adventure Hand, you play as a, um... hand, and you need to find the rest of your body and reattach yourself, because that just makes sense, right? What follows is perhaps one of the most insane platformers you'll have likely seen in quite some time; one in which you'll need to avoid deadly obstacles like chains and sawblades all while customising your hand with fabulous nailpaint.

Exotic (unique) weapons in the Destiny series have always been a way to add more flavor into the game: and that's especially the case with marquee expansion-centric exotics. Bungie just showed off seven more that are arriving in the mix with the Lightfall expansion, and things look promising so far: especially from an aesthetic perspective.
[gallery link="file" columns="7" size="medium" ids="360761,360762,360763,360764,360765,360766,360767"]
Here are the exotics shown off in the newest Destiny 2: Lightfall trailer, as well as how they work:
Final Warning (Charged tracking rounds)
Deterministic Chaos (Rhythmic debuffs)
Cyrtarachne's Facade (Grappple gives woven mail)
Abeyant Leap (Barricade spawns additional lashes)
Quicksilver Storm (Grenades create tangles on kills)
Swarmers (Destroying tangles spawns threadlings)
Winterbite (Freeze enemies with frost orb)
Expect more exotics to show up as the seasons progress, as well as raid-specific gear that will be kept secret until the raid itself hits.

Keep moving forward
Looking back on the last few years of Destiny, it's been a wild ride. One of the most off-the-rails tracks was definitely Destiny's foray into the Stadia realm (with hiccups): followed by its recent crash. I know some of the playerbase has been worn out by the last few expansions, but the vibrant neon hues of Lightfall could go a long way in terms of bringing me back.
We'll see how it turns out on February 28!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valiant Hearts: Coming Home, the sequel to 2014's Valiant Hearts: The Great War, is now available to play for all Netflix members. 
This Netflix-exclusive game can be played by any subscriber on iOS and Android devices. The sequel brings players back to World War I "for a dramatic narrative game following four interweaving stories of friendship, survival, and sacrifice amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war." Valiant Hearts: The Great War was a surprise hit back in 2014, garnering attention and storytelling praise from critics and players alike. 
Check out the Valiant Hearts: Coming Home release trailer below: 


"James joins the Harlem Hellfighters to search for his heroic older brother Freddie, while Anna tends to the wounded and broken," a press release about the game reads. "Ernst, a German driver, and George, a British aviator, each face their own challenges, and Walt, the canine companion from the first game, is back to aid players in their progress through exploration, puzzle-solving, and action sequences." 
Ubisoft says original core members that worked on Valiant Hearts: The Great War at Ubisoft Montepllier in 2014 have returned to develop Valiant Hearts: Coming Home in collaboration with Old Skull Games.
This is the first of three Ubisoft mobile games coming to Netflix. The next game is Mighty Quest, which is also due out this year and will bring Netflix subscribers a "roguelite-inspired hack-and-slash adventure." The third game will be an Assassin's Creed mobile game to coincide with Netflix's live-action Assassin's Creed series.

Confirmed in a tweet from the official @FireEmblemJP Twitter account, the 'Special Vocal Edition' CD will contain the full renditions of the game's opening and closing numbers ('Emblem Engage!' by RYO and 'Fiery Bonds' by Rainy) and will also come with a Blu-Ray disk for some bonus content.

This news was part of EA's Fiscal Year 2023 Q3 financial results released yesterday, in which the company revealed that it is also delaying Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to April.
EA says it is ending Battlefield Mobile, which hadn't been fully released yet (although many had played through betas), as part of a "pivot from the current direction to best deliver on our vision for the franchise and to meet the expectations of our players." The company adds that it is hard at work evolving Battlefield 2042, which launched to disappointment from fans, and in "pre-production on our future Battlefield experiences at our studios across the globe." 
As for Apex Legends Mobile, EA says that despite the game's strong start, "the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations" of its players. 
"At Respawn, we aim to provide players with games that are consistently outstanding," a statement from Respawn reads. "Following a strong start, the content pipeline for Apex Legends Mobile has begun to fall short of that bar for quality, quantity, and cadence. It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players." 
All real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores. From now until the game's shutdown on May 1, players can spend their existing Syndicate Gold and continue playing the full game. EA says it will not be providing refunds for money spent on Apex Legends Mobile in its FAQ, which answers other questions you might have here.

Capcom has updated its "Platinum List" depicting the veteran studio's best-selling title titles of all time — And despite several position swaps, the list's Top 20 remains completely dominated by two of the publisher's most consistent and loved franchises: Resident Evil and Monster Hunter.
Various entries in the premier survival horror franchise take up a total of seven slots in the Top 20, spearheaded by 2017's Resident Evil 7: Biohazard at No.3, 2019's Resident Evil 2 at No.4, and 2009's Resident Evil 5 at No.6. The series' most recent entry, 2021's Resident Evil Village, sits at No.8 with an impressive 7.4 million total sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.
“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”


When the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release.

Japanese toy mannufacturer Takara Tomy has revealed a new model in its popular 'Licca-chan' doll range based on Nintendo's Super Mario franchise (thanks, Automaton).
The release marks an official collaboration between Takara and Nintendo and features the doll wearing Mario's iconic red and blue overalls and hat. Also included is a cute little bag that's based on the yellow question mark block from the game series, along with a set of small paper accessories that you can whack into the bag itself. There's also a background piece that includes official Mario artwork, including Peach's castle, a Pirahna Plant, and more.

Greek mythology might not be the first thing to come to mind when you think of a vertical-scrolling shooter, but that didn't stop Namco from releasing Phelios in 1988, and it hasn't stopped Hamster from adding said title to its arcade collection this week (from 2nd February).
There's probably many out there who haven't stumbled across Phelios before (it spent a fair amount of time as a Japanese exclusive), so we'll give you the rundown. In this vertically-scrolling shooter, you play as Apollo (god of, like, everything), riding on his Pegasus to rescue the goddess Artemis. As the genre suggests, nay requires, there are a whole bunch of mythological beasties for you to take out along the way and a boss battle caping-off each level.

Did the combat hold up? Were they pleased to be dragged into a co-op session with me? Yes... and no. We had fun, but it didn't come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.

Electronic Arts is shuttering development on two of its mobile projects. Apex Legends Mobile is shutting down, and development on Battlefield Mobile is coming to a halt.
In an update posted today, the publisher characterized this as a "strategic decision." In regards to Apex Legends Mobile, EA says that despite the strong start, the "ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations" of players, and a mutual decision was made to sunset the mobile game. Apex Mobile was in development with Tencent subsidiary Lightspeed Studios.
Meanwhile, Battlefield Mobile was still in development. The decision was made to pivot from the current direction towards one that will "best deliver" on EA's vision for the Battlefield franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iron Galaxy’s Rumbleverse, its pro-wrestling-flavored battle royale, is shutting down next month, only seven months after its full launch last August. 
Though Iron Galaxy doesn’t plainly state the reason for Rumbleverse’s demise, a blog post somewhat hints that a lack of substantial players may have played a role, stating in part:
“When you work on a video game, you imagine the community that will show up to play it someday. For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”
Rumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. 
Rumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strut Your Stuff
If you have your eye on Street Fighter 6 newcomer Manon, then you aren't alone, as the dancer, model, and martial arts master has turned more than a few heads since she made her presence known as part of the upcoming scrapper's roster — Capcom released a new matchup of the French fighter in action, alongside the debut of her in-game theme.
https://youtu.be/nkmtV54XsJo
You can check out the fight above, which sees Manon severely outweighed and outgunned by another SF6 newcomer, Marisa. Still, with a  mastery of poise and balance, as well as her innate acrobatic ability, Manon still manages to get more than her fair share of licks in — demonstrating her deceptive reach, a physics-defying arsenal of grabs and throws, and a frankly bizarre "splits-slide".
Manon is definitely shaping up to be one of SF6's most interesting newcomers, from both a design and gameplay perspective.
Manon - Walk With Grace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k5XctUu0Dw&ab_channel=StreetFighter
Manon's theme, "Walk With Grace" is a smooth, modern effort, clearly composed to reflect not only the character's personality but also the many strings in her talented bow. The tune starts out with a melody as mysterious and as intriguing as the woman herself, before transitioning to a rhythmic "stride" — a beat that conjures up visions of confident models powerfully marching down a catwalk, or the red carpet. As a hybrid superstar, Manon has been afforded a tune that is a blend of her talents, synergizing together her celebrity status, her graceful motion, and her natural, somewhat aloof, sense of mystery.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Be sure to check out the themes for Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Jamie, Juri and Kimberly, and Blanka and Dhalsim, in our previous articles.

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Hero Cal Kestis, now a full-fledged Jedi, still fights to survive against the Galactic Empire alongside his allies BD-1 and Cere Junda. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The use of third-party tools in Final Fantasy XIV has been a hot-button issue for a while, and a recent clear of the MMO's newest Ultimate content has breached the topic once again.

In the letter from the producer, Yoshida cites the controversy surrounding the recent world-first clear of The Omega Protocol (Ultimate). Ultimates are Final Fantasy XIV's highest tier of content, and the race to be the first to clear it is intense, much like in other MMOs.

Load up your boomstick and oil your chainsaw arm, as developer Saber Interactive has announced that its getting ready to launch an all-new gore-filled endeavor for its sloshy scrapper Evil Dead: The Game — The "Splatter Royale" mode will be launching on all platforms as soon as this Thursday, February 2.
Splatter Royale, as you might have guessed from the moniker, is Evil Dead's unique take on the "Last Person Standing" Battle Royale genre enjoyed and popularized by such titles as Fortnite, PUBG, and Call of Duty Warzone. In the case of Ash Williams & his wild-eyed, tool-toting pals, Splatter Royale will see up to 40 players come together to throwdown in a hyper-violent, sinner-takes-all massacre.
https://twitter.com/EvilDeadTheGame/status/1620200430532976641?s=20&t=bJM2_lv6cwemhDjJ77Q2KQ
Saber Interactive has not offered up much information about this new mode at the time of writing, but one can assume that Splatter Royale will allow players to choose from a selection of Evil Dead: The Game's varied roster of survivors before fighting it out tooth, nail, and shovel in a bloodthirsty effort to be the mightiest Deadite slayer of them all. I got Mia!
Once Saber Interactive fully lifts the lid on Splatter Royale, we'll be sure to give you a heads-up on all of the head-cleaving details. Evil Dead: The Game is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

In the episode, Mike was being pressured by his three older brothers to evolve his Eevee the way that they evolved theirs. Each brother had a ridiculous hairstyle that matched some of the simultaneously cutest and coolest Pokémon I had seen: Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. In the end, Mike chose to not evolve his precious companion, and we all understood.
But you can make a different choice than Mike. In fact, you have way more options than he did during that episode. There are currently eight different evolutions of Eevee, colloquially called Eeveelutions. W…]]></summary>

We are still a couple of months away from the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie on 7th April 2023, but that means that the publicity can only increase from here. Remember that brief period of trepidation where none of us knew what the movie would look, sound, or even remotely be like? Ah, what sweet bliss. Now, we know all of the above and (to the amazement of many) we are almost 100% on board with it!
The most recent trailer brought with it even more game references as we got an extended look at Mario's fight with Donkey Kong in which the plumber dons a Cat Suit, presumably due to the appearance of a Super Bell. While the ensuing "meow" was enough to send a shiver down our spines, we have to admit that the idea of suits and power-ups appearing throughout the film is a pretty darn cool one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s big Marvel Snap update added the much-requested (and much-delayed) battle mode for friends. But it also made some changes to a few cards, including a surprise buff for Wolverine and a much-needed nerf to The Leader, a card many claimed was too OP and unfair in its previous state.

Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries looks set to stay working on the Halo franchise. But a new report details some big internal shifts at the company, including layoffs and a change in engine. All the while, the studio seems to not be actively working on any new story content for Infinite itself.
Bloomberg reports that 343 Industries will continue to work on Halo. This is in line with a statement from studio head Pierre Hintze, which said 343 will develop Halo now and in the future.
But while the franchise is staying with the studio, Bloomberg's article suggests that at least 95 people at 343 Industries lost their jobs as part of the recent Microsoft layoffs. This list, according to a spreadsheet seen by the outlet, contained …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.
“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”
Support for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.
【Important】 Service Termination Announcement

January 30, 2023
Crimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's "various circumstances" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.
If you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.
Do you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

That's why I thought I should tell you that these WH-1000XM5s are discounted to £249 on Sony's UK site when you use code UPGRADE50 to knock £50 off the price. This is the first time they've dropped to this level, and for a go-anywhere set of headphones they might just be worth a look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everybody pour yourself a Mystery Drink
Square Enix has registered with the Japanese Anniversary Association to request January 31 is officially recognized as "Final Fantasy VII Day".
January 31, 1997 is, of course, the fateful date that saw the legendary and genre-defining RPG hit Japanese retail stores. FFVII would synergize a combination of dramatic storytelling, beloved characters, a then-unheard-of world scale, and the massively popular Sony PlayStation console to spotlight a title that would, eventually, lead a global renaissance for the entire RPG genre — one that has only grown in popularity in the ensuing decades.
https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1620255927075995648?s=20&t=buig4p_njufMyjYewXWS6g
"The day that Final Fantasy VII came out, was not just a significant day for the Final Fantasy series, but also marked when so many big things started moving for those of us who worked on the game," wrote FFVII director Yoshinori Kitase in an anniversary message. "I remember being overwhelmed at the breakneck speed with which video game technology was evolving, but also dreaming big things for the future. With the establishment of this official anniversary day, I will now always remember these things, and hold them dearly in my heart."
Final Fantasy VII's legacy lives on in the many re-releases and spin-offs that have hit the market in the past 26 years, not to mention a plethora of merchandise, including model kits, plush toys, figures, statues, and clothing. The world of FFVII has been repeatedly visited in titles such as PS2 release Dirge of Cerberus, the beloved PSP spin-off, Crisis Core, and, more recently, the highly acclaimed Final Fantasy VII Remake, which sees the iconic adventure and its memorable cast of characters return in a fascinating, eyebrow-raising retelling of its (literal) revolutionary narrative.

Loop8: Summer of Gods is a game I have been looking forward to since I first caught wind of it nearly a year ago. From Xseed Games, Marvelous, and developer SIEG Games, Loop8 follows the exploits of protagonist Nini as he navigates life, friendship, and a demon invasion in 1980s Japan. The game takes place over the month of August in the quaint country town of Ashihara. The town is one of the last sanctuaries on Earth from the demon invasion and Nini, blessed with the power of Demon Sight, can reset time to the beginning of the month each time he and his friends fail to fight off the demon horde.
Originally planned to release in North America this spring, Xseed Games confirmed this morning the title is aiming for an early summer release. The announcement comes with the debut of a new trailer that focuses on the slice-of-life aspects of this sci-fi RPG adventure.

I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much on this one, but I'm really digging everything about Summer of Gods. With so many talented people on board for the project, including veterans of games like Lunar, Grandia, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin, and the Ace Attorney series, it's hard not to be excited about things to come.
I'll find out whether the game can live up to my lofty expectations when Loop8: Summer of Gods launches on June 6, 2023, for Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that 2023 was poised to be a big year for the Street Fighter franchise, thanks in large part to the impending launch of Street Fighter 6 this summer. However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.
Street Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.


"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters," Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. "We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.
Pre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.]]></summary>

Fighting games and phones might not seem like the most likely of allies, but the genre has thrived on the platform over the years with popular and expansive releases like Injustice 2, Power Rangers: Legacy Wars, and Skullgirls Mobile. The Street Fighter franchise is no stranger to the format, having released an excellent port of Street Fighter IV Champion Edition to iOS and Android several years ago. Next month, Ryu and company will return to mobile devices with Street Fighter: Duel, a free-to-play RPG that brings together 40 characters from the fighting game franchise in a new format that focuses on building teams of fighters.
So, you know, it sounds like most other mobile RPGs. And while the trailer below doesn't showcase any of Street Fighter: Duel's actual gameplay, if you go to its product page on the App Store or Google Play Store, you should see one screenshot that'll give you an idea of what it looks like in action. Maybe I'm looking too much into this, but I can almost see some inspiration from the wonderful Project X Zone games that have sadly been on ice since 2016.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9evri9ezo
Like with most other mobile RPGs you can download these days, Crunchyroll Games is promising PVP and a new story mode that'll no doubt find plenty of reasons to keep the same group of people constantly at odds with one another. If you're interested in Street Fighter: Duel, preregistration has opened on the App Store and Google Play Store. If anything, I'm sure this game will tide people over until the next "real" Street Fighter game launches this summer.
Here's to hoping it doesn't disappear in less than a year like Puzzle Fighter did. I'm still miffed about that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Highway to hell?
Given the critical and commercial success enjoyed by Life is Strange back in 2015, creating a compelling direct sequel can’t have been easy for developer Dontnod. Yet just three years later, players were surprised with a brand new story that was every bit as emotionally affecting as the first, if not more so. It boasts a plot that was both intimate yet grand in scope, taking two core protagonists on a road trip from hell after a tragedy tears them from their comfortable home life. In 2023, though, as the last main part of the Life is Strange puzzle to come to Switch, does the game still hold up? Well, yes… mostly.
Life is Strange 2 for the Switch contains all five episodes that were originally released over a staggered period of time back in 2019, as you would hope. Each episode will last you a couple of hours or so, so you’re looking at roughly 10-12 hours to complete the whole package, give or take. It uses that time pretty effectively, using the episodic structure to maintain a decent sense of pace throughout.

It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.
While Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

According to Bloomberg, 343 is developing Tatanka with Certain Affinity, who has helped develop various Halo games for more than 15 years. The project reportedly started off as a battle royale but has potentially evolved in different directions.

Following a recent Bloomberg report that stated Sony had told supply partners to prepare for a reduction in display panel orders, alongside word that the company had halved its shipment forecast as a result of disappointing pre-order numbers, Sony has refuted the claim in a new statement to GamesIndustry.biz. 
The publication reports that "PlayStation says it has not cut production numbers for its upcoming VR headset," touching on Bloomberg's report. Playstation told GamesIndustry.biz that it is "seeing enthusiasm from PlayStation fans for the upcoming launch, which includes more than 30 titles such as Gran Turismo 7, Horizon Call of the Mountain, and Resident Evil Village."

Vid bud Liam touched on the visual upgrades in his review, but since it’s been shaking my bones even harder than the original did, I wanted to dive even deeper into the mottled flesh of the modernised Dead Space to examine how all those new polygons and effects aren’t just there to please nerds. They do, in fact, make the remake scarier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've come to regard the four main games in the Life Is Strange franchise as kind of like the siblings in a big family. There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.
Then there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2005, Resident Evil 4 changed the face of survival horror. The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. 
We visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.
Issue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue! This massive spread reflects on the last year in games, featuring Top 10 lists from both the staff and our readers, our individual category awards, editor picks highlighting exceptional titles that didn’t crack the top 10, as well as the staff’s personal top 10 lists. On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

Print subscribers can expect their issues to arrive in the coming weeks. The digital edition of this issue launches later today for PC/Mac, iOS, and Google Play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Friday afternoon, 40 developers from Ubisoft Paris gathered to strike in the first labour stoppage of Ubisoft’s history. It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s "words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc," and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.


12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.

As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.
Battle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.

Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I'd be a bit disappointed. It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.
Forspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.

"In Avatar Generations, players assemble a team of iconic Avatar heroes and adversaries as they explore a dynamic map of the Four Nations," a press release reads.

Then, in September, the ESA revealed that E3 2023 will take place from Tuesday, June 13, through Friday, June 16. 
Now, IGN reports it has learned that PlayStation, Xbox, and Sony will be skipping E3 2023, a major blow to what was supposed to be E3's big comeback. The publication also reports that these companies won't have a presence on the Los Angeles Convention Center showfloor, either, which is where game companies typically have large (and flashy) booths where people can preview games and learn more about what's in store.

You’ll need to wait a little longer to help Cloud and friends clean up the city, as we don’t have a release date for the free Midgar Special Request DLC yet. The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.

It's got USB-C charging, KVM functionality, FreeSync/G-Sync... and it cost $1499 when it launched two years ago. 
Now, you can pick it up for $729 at Newegg when you use code JAN2548, an outstanding deal for a monitor of this size and quality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless is coming this fall, and this time it's injecting the series’ absurdity with a dose of classical Japanese history. 
This latest installment in the wacky strategy series unfolds in the feudal Japan-style demonic realm of Hinomoto. Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. 


Disgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. 
Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”


Thief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.

In a series of tweets published last Friday, Microsoft’s chief communications officer Frank X. Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision," but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker. Either way, it’s a toffee popcorn-worthy accusation in the ongoing drama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's not muck about here. Homeworld is essentially just Battlestar Galactica, if it were a real-time strategy game that jumped through a hyperspace gate exclusively onto PC. There's still much more to Relic Entertainment's sci-fi take on the plot of exiles returning home, though. When Homeworld's Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.

Hellcard will continue the story of Book Of Demons when it launches into Steam early access on February 16th, but instead of slicing up devil flesh in traditional hack and slash fashion, this time you'll be building decks of cards to tackle each dungeon layer as a roguelike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After weeks of speculation and leaks last year, a Dragon Ball Super collaboration officially went live in Epic Games' battle royale, Fortnite, in August. It brought Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Beerus to the game alongside a Kamehameha mystic item for use in-game and the Nimbus Cloud. Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite's battle royale island with "Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super" on it this morning, alongside tomorrow's date. This means we'll be seeing some (hopefully new) Dragon Ball Super content drop into Fortnite tomorrow.

As for what to expect, that remains unknown. Given the various characters in Dragon Ball Super, it could be anybody. But Dragon Ball mainstays like Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks, and even popular villains like Frieza, didn't make an appearance in Fortnite last year, so here's hoping we see all or some of them in the Item Shop tomorrow. There's also the possibility that we get some Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero content considering that movie hit theaters last August and was quite successful. 
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because the Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super collaboration begins tomorrow. 
Who do you hope to see added to Fortnite tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake feels like a game of yesteryear, in both good and bad ways. It’s a nostalgic romp through themed levels that feel more inspired than just another platforming tour through Bikini Bottom. It does a great job highlighting why people that grew up with SpongeBob SquarePants loved the show, and why people still love it today. At its best, the gameplay is decently fun, but at its worst, it’s mindlessly dull. This, coupled with a few bugs, like one that caused music to disappear completely, or…]]></summary>

Alongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar's Sanji, Emily Rudd's Nami, Godoy's Luffy, Jacob Gibson's Usopp, and Mackenyu's Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew's ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: 
While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven't seen Netflix's One Piece show in motion so here's hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. 
Wersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching's family. 
In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog's 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. 
I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU & Naughty Dog family! 💔

January 29, 2023
Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv's depiction of her character in HBO's The Last of Us over the past two few weeks.

Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.
To be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.

This fictional news segment highlights the efforts of Spider-Man, Kratos, Ratchet and Clank, the Eikons of the upcoming game, Final Fantasy XVI, and more from other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Returnal. However, amidst the clips, there are two shots that show what appears to be a young woman in a mysterious cave holding a torch as she approaches an ancient relic, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong. 
Released during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow "?" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. 
Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: 


As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7. 
For more, check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach.

Today is that long-awaited day, as one of the most beloved and influential games from its era is available now on both platforms. While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version. I played a decent chunk of both versions to see which one I prefer to play in 2023.
When GoldenEye 007 launched in the late 1990s, I played it obsessively both solo and with friends for months upon months. During that time, I accomplished all the missions on 00 Agent difficulty, unlocked all the cheats, and played through hundreds (if not thousan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO's The Last of Us is getting a second season.
Nearly three weeks after the premiere of the first episode, HBO has revealed that The Last of Us will return for a Season 2. Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. 
Check out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: 
The journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d
January 27, 2023
As for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. 
Episode 3 of HBO's The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. 
While waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. 
What do you think Season 2 of The Last of Us will cover? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that's jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick. Both games are being developed with input from veteran Far Cry series developers Ubisoft Montréal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It turns out Forspoken has bigger problems than some badly-landing bantz. The PC version absolutely brutalises low-end hardware, an issue compounded by its high yet often unhelpful system requirements, and framerate drops and stuttering remain common even on some of the best graphics cards around. Your best chance of a smooth ride in Forspoken lies in lowering some graphics options, so I’ve been trying them all out to see which are the best settings to cut down – as well as which ones you can afford to keep high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We kick off 2023's inaugural episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, by doing some - rare - forward thinking. That's right, Hayden gets genuinely excited over a couple of his most anticipated FPS games of the year, and I realise that I'm less "excited" and more "intrigued" by what's on offer. The consensus? We hope there are some strong surprises.
And we've started two new things! We're breaking the pod into two segments for the foreseeable future, with one half focused on current FPS stuff, and the other on games less-travelled in the space. Our first target? Deer in theHunter: Call Of The Wild.

If you too wish to once again to CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS and are uncertain about ponying up £50, here's how to get the original working well on PC.

Xenotilt transports the silver sphere action from the occult cathedral surroundings of Demon’s Tilt to a floating space hulk called the Samaritan. Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action. You can see just how hostile Xenotilt can get by watching the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Above the Berlin Samurai Museum's gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
From what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space’s Isaac Clarke is clearly a man of many talents. He’s a systems engineer by trade, so he knows his way around the dense innards of space vessels. He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!
But did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac's many talents and see what a hard worker he is.

Cook Serve Forever looks more ambitious again. It's a new game from the same developers with similar combo-tapping food prep at its core, but set in a new solarpunk city. As of today, there's a demo you can play and an early access release date set for April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shoulders Of Giants is out today on the Epic Games Store. When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of "What the hell is this?", which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: "Wooooaaaah."
Consider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.

Your opinion on whether that is a good thing or not will depend on how you feel about the endeavour of remaking games from fifteen years ago in the first place. As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.

Like a necromorph reanimating the dead, Motive Studios has revived Dead Space and made it stronger and more terrifying than before. This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the element…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.
It’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.

Omega’s card, aptly named Essence of the One-Winged Angel after his Final Fantasy-inspired finishing move, can slice foes with a powerful, wide-reaching attack using his angel wing. 
To learn more about the announcement, I sat down with Omega to chat about his Trooper card’s origins, his long-standing love of the series formerly known as Yak…]]></summary>

Earlier this week, I reported on the possibility of this new take on Dead Space getting an alternate ending. The Reunion ending was leaked by an achievements list for the remake, but now the Dead Space Twitter account has confirmed that the game does indeed feature a secret ending. That’s not all, either.

Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any ge…]]></summary>

After repeatedly stating that this evening's Xbox Developer Direct would feature just four games, it turned out to contain four. Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It's a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there's an even bigger surprse.

The bigger surprise is it's out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Xbox and Bethesda's Developer_Direct live stream, Tango Gameworks surprise announced its next title, Hi-Fi Rush. And if you know anything about the studio's previous games, it's a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. 
Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game's soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games' Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. 
Check out the trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang's latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.


If you're unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. 
In the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team's base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.
A blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.]]></summary>

In part because it was exactly the kind of game that could be found in the software section of your local supermarket, and in part because it appealed to dads, who would buy it and then their bored kids would play it in lieu of any other options.

Well, I'm the dad now, and the "full remake" Pharaoh: A New Era has a release date of February 15th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. 


These aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.

While the chain’s distinctive rocket doesn’t feature in any of the snaps, all taken by J. Carson in New York state, you can clearly make out the Red Rocket branding on its sign and bright red atomic fuel pumps. The whole look is very post-apocalyptic, dilapidated with beaten up 1950s-style American cars parked around the forecourt.

Quickly covering herself – and preventing an online outbreak reminiscent of a scene from the show and/or game – Ramsey stressed that the show being renewed was still a decision for the suits at HBO. “There's nothing confirmed yet so we'll have to wait and see,” she said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed back in September that the classic N64 game, GoldenEye 007, was coming to Switch, complete with online play. Microsoft announced that same day that GoldenEye 007 was coming to Xbox as well, although this version of the famed game would not feature online multiplayer like its Switch counterpart. 
Neither announcement included a release date, but today, developer Rare revealed that GoldenEye 007 launches this week, on Friday, January 27. The Switch version will be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack memberships, but you can purchase GoldenEye 007 individually on Xbox and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass as well.


Interestingly, the Xbox version, despite not featuring online functionality, will include improved control options (like dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
If you own Rare Replay on Xbox, you will gain access to GoldenEye 007 for free.
"Enter a world of espionage as Bond in GoldenEye 007," a press release reads. "Your covert operation to stop the GoldenEye weapon satellite spans the globe – you'll infiltrate underground bases, charge through a military train, and slink around the depths of a jungle. Along the way, M will brief you on your objectives and Q Branch will support your efforts with an array of gadgets, but the ultimate success of this mission is yours alone."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most new visitors don’t know about Mrs. Riddenbutter’s, but you should do yourself a favor and enjoy some of her hospitality and a tankard or two of her ale. Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.
