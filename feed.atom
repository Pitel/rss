        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiplayer shooters have become defined in recent years by the methods they use to withhold power from players, whether that’s a hero shooter's unlocks and battle pass or a survival shooter's vast map of scattered goodies. Even before these systems became du jour, however, shooters often required you to be good at them before you unlocked their real pleasures, whether by perfecting your rocket timing in Quake or memorising level layouts in Counter-Strike.

The Finals' real master stroke, I think, is that it has found a design that lets it be generous with power - even while containing an unlock system, a battle pass, and a not insignificant skill floor. Those things aren’t an obstacle between you and the childish joy of smashing the world to bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced that it is remaking the first saga of One Piece, and it's doing it with one of the best animation studios out there. 
Over the weekend, Netflix released a minute-and-a-half video celebrating the 25th anniversary of the One Piece anime, revealing in it that Wit Studio, the team behind Spy Family and the first three seasons of Attack on Titan, is producing "an all-new anime adaptation of the One Piece manga starting from the iconic East Blue saga." It will come to Netflix, although the company hasn't said when to expect it. 
Check out the announcement for yourself below: 


Notably, the East Blue saga is the first sage of the One Piece manga and anime, covering 100 chapters and roughly 60 episodes, respectively. This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. 
Beyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn't revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's One Piece Odyssey review.]]></summary>

Cave, a shoot-'em-up developer assembled from the ashes of Toaplan, was preparing to fold in 2001. The arcade scene was moving in new directions, relying on increasingly ostentatious Taikan cabinets to compete with the emerging technology of home consoles. For Cave, the 2D shoot 'em up, no matter how unerringly creative, was struggling to make the bottom line sing, and it was in large part thanks to Taiwanese company IGS that they survived another decade. Cave was so impressed with IGS's PolyGame Master arcade hardware and the bastard Donpachi entry they had created for it, that they licensed the tech to have one last charge - events that would deliver DoDonpachi DaiOuJou, its suffix loosely translating as “blissful death”.
Tsuneki Ikeda, lead programmer, video game auteur, and then the company’s public face, lamented that he could never make anything as impressive as Ikaruga. He was wrong. Over time, DaiOuJou stands not only superior to Treasure’s polarising genre hybrid, but is considered by enthusiasts to be one of the greatest games ever coded. It’s the shoot-'em-up equivalent to Capcom’s Super Street Fighter II Turbo or SNK’s King of Fighters ’98: a signifying work that does not date, and compels people decades on to play for fresh achievements. In 2015, at Shanghai’s Lie Huo arcade, the expert DaiOuJou players casually ripped through its two loops like tin foil, cigarettes dangling idly from their mouths. When questioned, all were unanimous in citing it as the apex of the bullet-hell sub-genre. And they were right. Although its difficulty is a high bar, learning to play it is also to understand its genius.

According to his recent Tweet, his peers, colleagues, and relatives expressed doubts concerning his plan to go independent. It appears that it wasn't that they had no faith in his abilities. Instead, it was because they held the belief that it "was impossible without the financial and organizational strength of a company." Despite this, Kojima proved that it is "an old-fashioned way of thinking."

It should be noted that Kojima wasn't facing unanimous discouragement, and there were a few who believed in his ideas. As…]]></summary>

Ever since the release of the Pokémon GO Plus wristband, there have been a handful of 'auto-catching' imitators keen to bring something new to catching 'em all. But many of these (including the catchily named Pokémon GO Plus +) have suffered from the same issue: after a while, they will disconnect from the game.
For the most part, until now this problem was only remedied by manually reconnecting the device, but Brook Gaming's Pocket iRecatcher is on the way to make this necessary step a little more automatic.

Atlus has announced that the Persona 5 series has surpassed an incredible 10 million copies sold worldwide. Now, the obvious caveat here is that we're talking about several games rather than just one, with the series comprised of the original Persona 5, its comprehensive Royal sibling, Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona 5 Tactica.
Still, 10 million is nevertheless a commendable feat and just goes to show the sharp increase in the franchise's popularity. Switch owners had been clamouring for Persona 5 for years before it was finally confirmed to launch on October 21st, 2022. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden followed in January 2023 before Persona 5 Tactica launched across all platforms on November 17th, 2023.

As a fan of the series, Dream Team's concept piqued my curiosity. To my surprise, I'm subscribed to Apple Arcade, allowing me to download the game without forking out any cash. What I discovered is a sterling Sonic platformer that'll unfortunately fly under the radar for most, despite providing the kind of gameplay fans are always desperate for.

Developer: Hardlight 
Publisher: Sega
Released: December 5, 2023

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Super Mario RPG first dropped, it showed the kind of magic that could happen when two of the biggest names in gaming — Square and Nintendo — combined their powers. The recent remake is a great reminder of how those creative decisions can introduce new players to a genre that otherwise never clicked for them.


I used to be among that crowd, appreciating the idea of role-playing games without ever quite grasping what made them work. Not to out myself as a Dumb Gamer™, but going from reflex-based to menu-based action was jarring for me. When you're a kid who almost exclusively plays platformers, beat 'em ups, and run-and-gunners, it can be difficult to make the leap to RPGs. It certainly wasn't for lack of trying, either.

What’s the meaning of life? Are we alone in the universe? How do you know if the fridge light goes off after you close the door? It’s questions like this that have driven humankind to explore the planet, the cosmos, and ourselves. And the kitchen. This irresistible drive of curiosity and the addictive high of discovery are what Outer Wilds captures so well, letting this indie game put big-name space exploration titles to shame.
Mobius Digital’s mesmerising cosmic adventure that is Outer Wilds first landed on PC and Xbox in 2019 to serious critical acclaim. Receiving plaudits around the internet and a Best Game BAFTA to boot, it’s no surprise that it topped stacks of game-of-the-year lists. It’s been a long wait for Switch gamers hoping for a port, but it’s mostly good news: the indie masterpiece has kept its magic in the jump to Nintendo’s portable – albeit with a bit of a technical struggle. The Echoes of the Eye DLC has also found its way over as part of the Archaeologist’s Edition, although we received the base game for review.

With the collapsing force of the star and the growing instability brought on by the Warp, evacuations were ill-advised. Still, I could try to save the nearby planet's population, but allies noted that the Warp had likely corrupted them. Alternatively, a member of the Adeptus Mechanicus asked if I'd consider diverting resources to save a piece of sacred machinery.

The little blue guy known as Mega Man (along with his various associates and related robots) has had a very long and storied career in video games. Since the NES days, he's starred in some absolute classics of the run-and-gun genre, although for every incredible game or spin-off experience Capcom has delivered, there have arguably been one or two titles that either didn't quite hit the mark or — more often — felt a little too familiar. With so many games in the Blue Bomber's back catalogue, it can be hard to know which ones are the cream of the crop. Well, that's where we come in.

The original Mega Man series is well known for its punishing difficulty, particularly for newcomers. With time, patience, and persistence, it is relatively easy to learn the ropes and get through each entry with little fuss, but if there’s one thing the original franchise lacked — particularly on the NES — it was a tutorial. You were simply thrown into the ring with a selection of six to eight stages to choose from, and that’s about it.

Although the Mortal Kombat 1 team has shown strong support for the Switch version of the game so far with updates and all the DLC, it seems the cross-play feature might be skipping Nintendo's hybrid system.
In a live stream earlier this week, NetherRealm confirmed cross-play was coming on February 2024 to PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Unfortunately, there was no mention or reference to the Switch version of the game.

Sea of Stars arrived on the Switch earlier this year in August and featured a segment in it where Khalil showed up as a non-playable character known as "Jirard the Constructionist", who the main heroes of the story could interact with. This decision follows Khalil being accused of "charity fraud" last month.

Gaming's the new kid on the block, and it seems pathologically obsessed with clinging onto Hollywoodesque tropes and presentation styles. Nevertheless, with its flourishing popularity, the gaming industry does occasionally show deep-seated desires to forge an independent identity.



FMV games complicate the situation further. They're not quite movies, as you're invited to interact with the story. On the other hand, when you have live-action scenes in your game, it's understandable to feel like you're engaging with the work of folks who'd much rather be on film sets.

Fans of 2D platformers in the Metroidvania mould aren't exactly lacking for excellent examples of the genre. It feels like every other game launching at the moment is either a roguelite deckbuilder or an explorative action platformer. It's a brave developer who dips a toe into this particular genre pool; with so many great alternatives available, merely 'competent' just isn't going to stand out in the crowd.

It's GOTY time, lovely people.
Looking back over the last 12 months, it's been an incredibly fruitful year for gamers. Industry-wide layoffs in recent months have been a sobering counterpoint to the glut of great games for anyone who cares about the talented people who crafted them and the future of the medium, and the pandemic-related backlog of projects which seemed to flush through in 2023 made it difficult to keep tabs on everything we would have liked to, but it's been a good year for anyone just playing video games, with Switch enjoying an excellent seventh cycle.

South Florida was my home, and feeling its vibe is rare unless I visit family. That is, until I saw the long-anticipated trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI. I've watched it more than a few times now, and my only thought is, "Yeah, that's Florida."

I was probably 7 at the time, and I wrote to Shiny Entertainment asking them if they were going to make an Earthworm Jim 2. Amazingly, they wrote back. Not just some pre-formatted response, either. They actually answered my questions. I wish I still had that letter.


After Earthworm Jim 2, Shiny adopted a no-sequel policy. Earthworm Jim 3D wasn’t developed by Shiny, and as an N64 owner, I wouldn’t play another game by the developer until 2003’s Enter the Matrix. At that point, Shiny had been sold to Infogrames, and their last years …]]></summary>

The world of Dota doesn't have a Santa Claus, but it seems that Wraith King is stepping up to fill his shoes nonetheless, and his "Naughty List" includes thousands of accounts that have been positively unsportsmanlike.


Indeed, the Frostivus 2023 update that rolled out incorporates a hilarious surprise for smurfs and other bad actors in Dota 2. Some of these players were surprised to learn that the specific Frostivus bundle in their Armory was not a gift chest featuring cosmetics and the like, but a "highly toxic lump of coal," with punishments ranging from behavior score penalties to main account bans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari and Mega Cat Studios have released Food Fight: Culinary Combat, a multi-player reimagining of the somewhat bizarre 1983 arcade game, into Early Access. The catch is that, right now, it’s exclusively available on the Atari VCS.


As a note of disclosure, I did a stint with Mega Cat Studios writing for their blog and for a still unannounced (and maybe canceled?) game. They weren’t working on Food Fight at the time, as far as I know.




By the looks of things, Food Fight: Culinary Combat doesn’t really have anything to do with the 1983 arcade game. Maybe. It’s hard to tell. It’s the type of trailer that cuts so frequently that you don’t get a very good look at things. There is a single-player mode, and maybe you fight chefs, or perhaps instead, it’s zombie food.

Dragon Quest possesses so much history that any new game carries a degree of raised expectation. Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince delivers many of the conventions I’ve come to expect from the series: the vibrant opening song, the charismatic Slime, and the emotional storytelling I already associate with the franchise. But this game goes beyond those well-treaded territories, offering an intelligent and elegant yet simple approach to combat and dungeon design that makes it a solid spin-off experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In sad news for anyone who enjoys fan games and remakes of retro titles, Nintendo has shut down a fan-made The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening PC port. 


Eurogamer reported on this disappointing turn of events for the Zelda fangame community, and reiterating its features only makes its loss sting. The Link's Awakening PC port included some lovely features, including supporting up to 120 frames per second, widescreen, and zooming options that could let you see virtually the entire world map at once. That still doesn't change how ardently protective Nintendo is over its properties, so it called for the game be pulled from Itch's pages.


According to the Nintendo representative who sent the notice of infringement, "It has come to our attention that the following game, https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd, offered on Itch.io infringes and makes unauthorized use of Nintendo’s copyrights in The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening video game."


Any downloads for the Link's Awakening port are no longer available on its Itch.io page. Its takedown is a shame, but not a surprise.




Nintendo is infamous for its ironclad control over its IPs, with well-documented fights with other fan projects. There are plenty of cases in the past of projects like this gradually picking up internet infamy, then receiving a cease-and-desist.


While Nintendo's within its legal rights to go after these projects, it's sad to see interesting projects like these go. Link's Awakening is still available on Switch, either through the remake or Switch Online's Game Boy collection.

        <updated>2023-12-15T19:53:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is now available on Xbox Series platforms, but don't expect the game to make its way to Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service anytime soon.


In a recent interview with IGN, Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke confirmed the company has no plans to release its award-winning title on Game Pass, citing the game's sheer scope as a factor for this decision.


"We made a big game, so I think there's a fair price to be paid for that, and I think that that is okay," Vincke said. "We don't charge you any micro-transactions on top of it, so you get what you pay for. Upfront, it's a big meaty game. So I think that should be able to exist as it is. This is what allows us to continue making other games."


With the average Baldur's Gate 3 playthrough running for at least 50 hours (according to player data aggregated by HowLongToBeat) Vincke definitely has a point there. My own run took me 107 hours, and I  ignored a whole bunch of side quests and points of interest in Act 3.


Larian doesn't seem inclined to give up Xbox's market potential for a Game Pass deal with Microsoft, and given the game's overwhelming success, it's no wonder.




Still, Xbox fans might find it disappointing that the studio is dismissing the possibility altogether. Vincke, who recently released his full Game of the Year acceptance speech, certainly isn't mincing words when he talks about knowing what their game is really worth. 


While Baldur's Gate 3 took home multiple trophies at The Game Awards and has received a lot of acclaim, it's easy to see how some might still be wary of spending $70 if they're not not an initiate of the CRPG genre or Dungeons & Dragons itself. 


A Game Pass demo might have gone a long way toward alleviating those fears. But as of now, Larian has no plans for one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a decade in Early Access, Planet Management God Simulator The Universim is finally set for its full 1.0 release. Developer Crytivo revealed today that the God Sim will leave Early Access on January 22, 2024. Alongside a ton of improvements, the full release also introduces the space age which gives players access to advanced technology including the all-new planet cracker. 




A decade of features


The God Simulator has been in development for ten years now, including a successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2014 that got almost $400k in backing. With the full release of The Universim, players will be able to explore an unlimited amount of space and colonize as many planets as they wish, each with their own conditions and challenges. Some planets will be abundantly resource-rich providing a great opportunity to expand and prosper with your civilization. Over 600 new voice-over lines have been added to enhance the now-completed storyline. 


The Universim has become quite popular among the simulation community, with over half a million Steam wishlists and over 6,000 reviews giving it a Very Positive rating.


I played The Universim years ago and loved it, and with all the content they've added in recent years, this is the perfect time for me to give it another go. If you're looking for a multi-planet faring God Simulator, you should definitely check it out.


The Universim fully releases on PC via Steam on January 22, 2024.

Earlier this year, Hideki Kamiya shocked his fans by announcing that he would leave PlatinumGames. Now unemployed, he's spent much of his time watching streaming content and creating YouTube videos, but after sitting down with IGN, we now have a clearer picture of why he left the company.
He's touched on this before, of course, stating in a previous YouTube video that "I left the company because I wanted to follow my beliefs as a game creator and to choose the path I think is right and move on". There's not a lot to go on, admittedly, so this new statement brings a bit more clarity on Platinum's role in Kamiya's decision:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil 4 being nominated for several categories at The Game Awards 2023 shows that remakes are still very much in vogue. It seems evident that we should never forget the classics. And that's exactly what this one modder is doing with the original RE2.


Perhaps in an attempt to blend modern Resident Evil with the retro installments, Itch.io user PerroAutonomo has been remaking the second game in the series. Only, they aren't updating the visuals or the cheesy dialogue. No. They're sticking with how the original 1998 release looked, but have made it into a first-person shooter.




The above video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil does a half hour playthrough of the demo. As for when the full thing will be released, PerroAutonomo's page says they may not finish it, and the current build "has many errors" (translated by Google).


Complete with fully remade cut scenes


The footage shows how authentic this unofficial remake is. It endeavors to keep the visual style of Resident Evil 2 but chooses a different perspective. We get to see a lot of the game from new angles never seen before, and even though it's a fan project, it's still impressive to see.


As Capcom marches forward with its iconic survival horror series, we welcome whatever's on the horizon. With more Resident Evil remakes being confirmed, everyone's going to be wondering which one's going to get the remake treatment next.


We may well get to see a fresh take on one of the spin-offs, such as Code Veronica or Umbrella Chronicles. Or maybe RE5 will get another crack at not being a disappointment. Time will tell on that front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Via Twitter, Square Enix has announced that the latest in the SaGa series, SaGa: Emerald Beyond, will launch on April 25, 2024. It’s coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.


While a new SaGa entry was talked about as far back as 2021, SaGa: Emerald Beyond was only officially announced in the September 2023 Nintendo Direct. It’s the latest from the long-running series, dating back to 1989 with Makai Toushi SaGa or The Final Fantasy Legend. You don’t have to have been following the series since then, as this one is supposedly standalone.




SaGa: Emerald Beyond is an RPG where you take control of six protagonists and explore 17 interconnected worlds. It features a branching storyline based on the choices you make. The combat is turn-based, with a great deal of emphasis put on the timeline, which tracks turn order. From the look of it, it’s similar to Fuga: Melodies of Steel, where your success is determined partially by how you can maximize your speed while delaying the enemy.


I’ve never gotten into the SaGa series, mainly because I don’t really know where to start. I’ve played The Final Fantasy Legend, but dropped off partway through. I’m not sure sequentially is the right move here. However, SaGa: Emerald Beyond looks rad as heck, with some great character design and imaginative worlds.


SaGa: Emerald Beyond releases on April 25, 2024 on Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just Steam that has sale events, albeit those are the ones most PC gamers think of. Other outlets such as GOG also put some deals on as well, and the CD Projekt-owned distribution site has recently started its winter sale.


If you head over to Good Old Games, you'll see a host of titles that are currently on offer. The event is going until January 4, so you've got some time to get a few downloads in around the Christmas period.




As for what's on offer, there's a veritable bevy of classic/retro and more modern releases. For example, the original Mortal Kombat games are currently 75% off, as is the complete Yakuza series. The remake of System Shock is 35% off and, naturally, Cyberpunk 2077 and the DLC are discounted at 50% and 15% respectively.


Yes, of course Skyrim is in the sale, too


All-in-all, there are around 6,000 games that are part of the winter sales event. Oh, I could list off many more examples, but I'd be here for quite some time.


Suffice it to see, there's quite a few that I'll be tempted to pick up between now and January. I was pleasantly surprised to see the Myst 30th anniversary collection at nearly 60% off. Not because I'm a fan of Myst (have never played it), but because I don't think I even knew it was that old. Time is fleeting, etc.


Anyway, as we approach the end of 2023, all the gaming platforms and websites will be putting on their own sales. Look out for the Steam winter event next week. Admit it. That's probably what most of you are waiting for.

In an X post made by the PowerWash Simulator account, a gift has arrived for those who wish to clean a bit more. Players on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam can access a new free level on December 14, 2023, and Switch players can get in on the fun on January 8, 2024.


PowerWash Simulator brings Santa's Workshop to life


The level itself is a small but densely packed affair, with plenty of nooks and crannies to blast clean. I hadn't touched PowerWash Simulator since the SpongeBob SquarePants DLC back in June and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it all came back to me. Before I knew it, Christmas had been saved and my trip to the North Pole could be written off as a business expense.


Every one of PowerWash Simulator's offerings, both free and paid, has been an utter delight. Santa's Workshop is no different and offers plenty of reasons to boot up the relaxing title and spray away the gunk.




With the Warhammer 40,000 DLC being delayed to 2024, this bite-sized DLC should hopefully be enough to tide players over. Either way, if you've been wanting a break from other titles or even want to take power washing into the third dimension, PowerWash Simulator has you covered. Just make sure you wear the proper PPE when cleaning Cloud's Buster Sword in the Seventh Heaven Bar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A pair of 2D horizontal shoot 'em ups are gearing up for another revival courtesy of ININ Games. The publisher announced plans to bring both The Legend of Steel Empire and Over Horizon to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in early 2024.


The Switch version of The Legend of Steel Empire will touch down first on Switch in January, then PS4 at a later date. Following the 1992 Sega Mega Drive and 2004 Game Boy Advance Steel Empire games by HOT-B, this one is an HD remaster based on the PC version with some additional features. These include reworked controls, high-definition visuals, and a leveling system that boosts both your strength and the resilience of your enemies depending on how many items you collect.


Also included in the physical Steel Empire Chronicles from Strictly Limited, The Legend of Steel Empire will be available physically and digitally on Switch. Here's a trailer: 




Over Horizon is a spiritual successor of sorts, with development from HOT-B and the co-director of Steel Empire. This entry wasn't released outside of Japanese and PAL territories, so fans of the series around the world will soon be able to check it out on Switch and PS4. Over Horizon is currently penciled in for sometime in early 2024 for both platforms. 


If you're looking for the most comprehensive collection, that Strictly Limited release still has a handful of LE Switch versions in stock. It includes the Steel Empire HD remaster, as well as the Mega Drive and Game Boy Advance versions, and the NES version of Over Horizon. You won't find the 3DS version there, though, so you'll have to stick to the second dimension.

Hell's bells, now I feel old. If you're unfamiliar with it, it's about a girl named Anna who must escape from a mysterious island, but the whole game is presented like you're reading a book - only one that you can click on and prod with your fingers to reveal new puzzles within that text. It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. 
Once you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller.

Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To celebrate Doom's 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS's influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as "boomer shooters" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.
I reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.

More specifically, Rocket Arena will come to an end at Noon PT/3 p.m. ET on March 21, 2024. As for why, the team doesn't really address that in its announcement but presumably, it has lost the player count needed to sustain its live-service, multiplayer model. 
Rocket Arena will be sunset on March 21, 2024 12:00 PM PDT. We’ll have some community events leading up to the date.

I've played just a handful - certainly, far from enough to pronounce myself any kind of expert - but I do feel like I've played one of the best in the shape of Siren, a Doom II total conversion from Dithered Output, the first episode of which can be downloaded free from Itch.io.


The mod's overall vibe is encapsulated, I think, by the sentient vending machine you meet a short way in, just round the corner from a rec room that contains a disembodied head on tentacles, and down the corridor from a tiered canteen full of ghouls and unsympathetic men with shotguns. You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? "No."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven’t been keeping up with player reaction to the latest Twar and Twarhammer games, but it seems players are none too pleased with Creative Assembly right now. In a rather dramatic open letter, the company's vice president Roger Collum has acknowledged that Total War: Warhammer 3’s Shadows of Change add-on and the recent historical strategy outing Total War: Pharaoh did not ship in a desirable state, with complaints ranging from wobbly execution to overpricing. The studio will try to make things right by offering partial refunds to Pharaoh owners and giving away DLC on top of the usual updates.

I believe that these two examples form a representative sample of what mods are: quality of life improvements, and Shrek. Doom’s modding community, known by its file package WAD, is the Ur modding community. Thanks to John Carmack’s lightning-fast engine, creating levels and content for Doom has been accessible for 30 years. WAD devs have gone on to become fully-fledged game designers, and some WADs have been released commercially. The breadth and depth of this community formed the bedrock of game developers. And yet even with this pedigree, MyHouse.WAD is a miracle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to 3D Realms founder Scott Miller, the Danish development company is the latest to be hit with layoffs from parent company Embracer Group. Miller confirmed that several sources from the company told him that at least half of the company had been laid off. 3D Realms has had quite a few recent releases including Ion Fury: Aftershock, RIPOUT, The Kindeman Remedy, and Kingpin: Reloaded. Embracer Group acquired 3D Realms in 2021.


When will it end?


This continues the almost weekly trend of Embracer Group enacting layoffs, with over 900 employees losing their jobs just this year at the hands of Embracer. According to an interim report by Embracer, the layoffs are due to a reduced number of projects across the board. All while posting a 13% increase in net sales this year.


Of course, Embracer Group is just a piece of the story. According to VideoGameLayoffs.com which tracks layoffs across the industry, over 9000 jobs have been lost this year. From small indie companies to massive industry giants, it's been a rough year for the industry all around.

In a blog post, Naughty Dog explains it made the “incredibly difficult” decision to cancel the project after it apparently became so big that the studio realized it would need to devote precious resources to support it post-launch for years to come. When faced with the reality of having to become a studio solely dedicated to supporting a live service game or to continue making single-player experiences, it chose the latter. 
Here's Naughty Dog's full statement:

The project has been in development for some time, with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann taking the stage at Summer Game Fest 2022 to talk about it. Outside of concept art, the multiplayer endeavor has been mostly quiet, with the team saying it needed more time earlier this year.


In today's statement, the studio explains some of its reasoning behind the decision to call off The Last of Us Online. The multiplayer team had been in pre-production since the studio was working on The Last of Us Part II.

The new RPG from Larian Studios had a thunderous launch out of Early Access in August, and has since taken the world by storm, even securing the Game of the Year trophy at The Game Awards 2023.


With all that acclaim and widespread popularity, you are likely to have a Baldur's Gate 3 fan in your life. Maybe you, yourself, are one. And it's that time of year where we celebrate, gather together, and exchange gifts. It's festive and terrifying.


Don't fret too much, though. I've been scouring the internet for my own BG3 indulgences to shove underneath the tree, and have surfaced with a few I'm willing to share here. (For everything else, consult your local fic author and/or commissioned artist…]]></summary>

Fortunately, the best titles in this field are (usually) exceptions to this norm.


When done right, a good live service game is like a second home. Ideally, these games are hubs where you can party up with friends and enjoy new content and features at a steady pace. If the presence of microtransactions and paywalls are kept in check, these titles can offer unforgettable experiences. Of course, I imagine some of you will argue that certain picks below don’t meet that bar. But that’s why we’re here to choose which ongoing game is the best of the best.

I was wondering how I missed the announcement, but apparently, the heads-up was only given on December 11. Cosplay Club is a single-player, turn-based RPG where you get powers from the costumes you craft. In that sense, it reminds me of Costume Quest, but there seems to be a lot more customization here. You’re able to craft your own Magical Girl costume, and you gain new parts that expand the customization.


Cosplay Club takes place in the Chroma Squad universe, where the eponymous squad saved the world. Truly, the two games share a similar narrative foundation, as both are about costumes and imagination leading to real empowerment.

Fortunately, we saw some truly incredible remakes in 2023 that actually do justice to their source material.


The distinction between a “remake” and “remaster” became especially blurred in 2023. In some cases, we saw some really comprehensive remakes. These titles reimagined the games they're based on from the ground up, adding so much new stuff that even longtime fans had no idea what to expect. Conversely, we saw some remakes that felt more like very pretty remasters. These were games that worked overtime to feel as much like the original titles as possible, often focusing on visuals and music over sweeping gameplay changes.

I’m a fan of the Total War series and Warhammer 3 in particular, but I’m clearly out of the loop. I checked into what caused this and, wow, it’s quite the beehive. In terms of Pharaoh, the game has largely been seen as not really iterating on the series and generally being disappointing overall. For Total War: Warhammer 3, a lot of discontent has been brewing under the pricing scheme for the game’s terrifyingly abundant content packs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Blade was one of the most exciting reveals from the Game Awards. Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.
Luckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:

Concept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane's environmental design, and Blade's positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane's games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition didn’t launch in the greatest state, but after months of fixes, the game has been deemed ready to launch on mobile devices. The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.
Like all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.


Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. 
In addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release. You can watch the game’s debut trailer here.]]></summary>

That might seem like an odd thing to say about your own company's activities. But when you look at what Nightdive have done in the last twelve months, it's less surprising. In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. 


In short, it's been a busy year for the remastering maestros. In the wider context of 2023, which has been simultaneously a banner games and a deeply worrying year for the people making them, I wanted to know how Nightdive view the last twelve months, and what the audience response to these projects means for the studio's future.

Unfortunately, the developer won't be able to hit that deadline, as it posted this update on social media yesterday.

Unfortunately, all that we can really recall is the occasional watch party, and maybe Keanu Reeves was there at one point? Was mostly just trailers, let’s be honest. Thus we also consider the events that replace it (with a side-chat on this year’s Game Awards), and how we’d design our own glittering showcase o' games.
We also share what we’ve been playing this week, make a single non-PC game recommendation (that also represents the strangest coincidence in EWS history), and take another look at the Lenovo Legion Go. Last time I talk about the Lenovo Legion Go for a while, promise.

I appreciate that a PC gaming site might not be the most natural home for this information, considering both that these are not technically gaming CPUs and that that Meteor Lake’s most hyped-up feature is more of a productivity aid: a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for client-side AI work. However, as the new H-series parts also integrate Intel Arc graphics for the first time, there is some interesting potential for them to transform lightweight ultrabooks into viable gaming laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game openings have always been a source of fascination for me. As a player, you're excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you'll see, the challenges you'll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they've never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? 
In revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it's clear that even id's iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it's tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn't just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom's rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.

Earlier today, word got out that A24 and Kojiima Productions were partnering up for a live-action feature film adaptation of Death Stranding. News of this partnership came by way of a new A24 shirt adorned with some strands from Death Stranding; the t-shirt's description revealed A24 and Kojima Productions had entered an official partnership.
At the time, official channels for Kojima Productions and A24 had not said anything regarding this partnership. But now, the official A24 Twitter account has confirmed the partnership. 
"It's official: we've partnered with Kojiima Productions on the live-action feature film adaptation of Hideo Kojima's acclaimed video game, Death Stranding," the tweet reads.

As a child, my family didn't have much money and I didn't get my first laptop until I was 16. Thus, I missed out on a lot of what are now considered PC staples. With dread, I'm often met with the accursed exclamation, "You've not played insert game before?" followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work?

But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESA hasn’t been able to open the doors to the highly regarded in-person convention.
However, Keighley is the driving force behind Summer Game Fest, a newly established but increasingly successful showcase effectively competing with E3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Othercide from French developer Lightbulb Crew is one of my favourite recent tactics RPGs. It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.
But I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.

        <updated>2023-12-13T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.
Now, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption. Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. 


In the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is "nope" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game analyst group Circana has released its November 2023 U.S. Video Game Market Highlights report and in it, the company reveals that, unsurprisingly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III was the best-selling game of the month. It launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on November 10 and is already the second best-selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
The annual Call of Duty game always sells extremely well – it has taken the top spot of November for five years straight – so today's results are no surprise. However, what's new this time around is that Modern Warfare III is now an Xbox-owned game, after Microsoft successfully completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Also, notably, despite Modern Warfare III reviewing poorly – it has a 56 on Met…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in just over a month, on January 26, 2024. As the release date nears, developer Bandai Namco has been releasing more and more about the latest entry in its flagship fighting series. We learned about newcomer Reina last month, and recently went hands-on with the game, too – read Game Informer's Tekken 8 preview here. Now, Bandai Namco has revealed the first gameplay trailer for its "mechanized space ninja" Yoshimitsu. 
It did so with a new Tekken 8 gameplay trailer that shows Yoshimitsu ripping and slicing through various fighters in the game's roster. This ninja is no stranger to the Tekken series, having appeared in every mainline numbered Tekken game since the series' start – he's actually my favorite fighter, and for money, this is his best look yet. 
Check him out in the Tekken 8 Yoshimitsu reveal and gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yoshimitsu unsurprisingly relies on his ninja sword to do a lot of damage to enemy fighters. And he does so with the speed the character is known for. 
Tekken 8 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Tekken 8 fighter reveal trailers for characters like Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, Marshall Law, Jun Kazama, and Reina. After that, read Game Informer's preview thoughts of Tekken 8 after playing the game for a couple of hours.

It announced this by way of a Starfield subreddit comment from the official developer Reddit account, as reported by IGN. The team says it's working on other things, too, like quest fixes, hotfixes, and more. 
It says players can expect a rollout of fixes and updates roughly every six weeks, although if something can be corrected with a quick hotfix, it might launch those in between the six-week waits.


While bug and progression fixes are nice, it's the new ways of traveling and city maps that has me most excited. Traversing Starfield's cities is fun, but actually learning them is quite difficult without a map. And I'm hoping the ne…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War  Ragnarök's Valhalla DLC is out now on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, less than a week after it was revealed at The Game Awards 2023. It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's "Show Me Mastery" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. 
"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. 
There is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.
December 12, 2023
God of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it's safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. 
You can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Consider yourself warned! This book contains scenes of graphic violence!" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. "Knee-deep in the dead!" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.
The cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve "Body Bag" Behling and Michael "Splatter" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: "Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'"

I think that the popularity of "looting", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.
I distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mouse, an upcoming classic first-person shooter sporting a vintage rubber hose animation style, turned heads in May with its first look at gameplay. Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.
The noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.
Mouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. 


Mouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It joins the growing ranks of confirmed 2025 titles such as Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Big Walk, Usual June, and Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.]]></summary>

It seems genuinely historic, to me: a tech company formally giving their workforce a say on the adoption of tools that continue to feel like  a pretext for efficiency-minded "restructuring".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years ago, developers Fntastic debuted their "open world survival MMO" The Day Before with a fairly lengthy trailer (which has since been scrubbed from their official YouTube channel, but it's been preserved by IGN and Gamespot). It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.
Now, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would've rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.

There's never been a better time to get into Ace Attorney. Developer-publisher Capcom has spent the last few years remastering and re-releasing every game in the series, and with the Apollo Justice trilogy, you can now play every mainline game on modern consoles. And even though the three games in this collection are unchanged story-wise, after going hands-on, we can comfortably say that they've never felt better.
The collection contains three games: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice – …]]></summary>

The first E3 took place in 1995 and the last in-person conference happened in 2019. The 2020 event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but E3 returned for one last bout in 2021 with an all-digital event.

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. 
It was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too.

"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close," ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. "We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners." 
Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business "has blossomed in different ways," noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. "That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways."

Following the events of Tekken 7, the stage for Tekken 8’s story is set up to be perhaps the most over-the-top yet. In the six months since the defeat of Heihachi Mishima, his son, Kazuya Mishima, has installed a reign of terror over the planet using his devil powers. And while the setup is, quite frankly, a lot to take in, if the first four chapters I played are any indication, the level of spectacle and bombast reaches new levels in Tekken 8’s Story Mode.
The first chapter opens with Lars Alexandersson on a high-tech plane. He mentions the mission is to take down "evi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hasbro, the parent company behind Wizards of the Coast, which itself is responsible for both Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, is laying off 1100 employees, as reported by Dicebreaker and The Wall Street Journal. The company, which is also behind the Transformers franchise (toys and other media),  announced this decision yesterday, on December 11. 
Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks called the need for layoffs in an email sent to staff a "lever we must pull to keep Hasbro healthy" and "a last resort." As noted by Dicebreaker, Cocks became CEO of Hasbro in February of last year and earns roughly $1.5 million in salary in the position – his total earnings for 2022 amounted to $9.4 million, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of course I was going to insert myself into the recent Tribes 3: Rivals alpha playtest – as a Tribes: Ascend player who’s mourned its demise for years, the reveal of a new, heavily Ascend-inspired ski-shooter was like seeing a long deceased pet rabbit miraculously come back to life. Cured, judging from Rivals’ more palatable monetisation plans, of the myxomatosis that killed it in the first place.


From what I played, Tribes 3 can definitely bring back happy memories of zipping around, nicking flags and copping Spinfuser blasts, and the finished article may well have the chops to create some new ones. At the same time, the playtest build was conspicuously short on much of what makes Tribes really feel like Tribes.

        <updated>2023-12-12T13:29:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terra Nil, the "reverse city builder" from developer Free Lives and publisher Devolver Digital, is coming to Switch next week. More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. 
While many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. 


As you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one. 
If you're unsure whether or not the game is for you, read Game Informer's Terra Nil review to learn what we thought about it. Listen to us talk more about it on this episode of The Game Informer Show after that. 
Are you going to check out Terra Nil on Switch next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Fntastic, the studio behind The Day Before, announced yesterday that it was shutting down. It said at the time that servers for the game, which launched last week on December 7, would remain operational but that the future of The Day Before is unknown. Now, less than 24 hours later, The Day Before is no longer available for purchase on Steam (although you can still visit the page). 
Plus, anyone who purchased the game is eligible for a refund, according to Fntastic. 
"Answer to those who ask for a refund," a Fntastic tweet reads. "[We and publisher Mytona are] currently working with Steam to allow refunds for any player who chooses to request one, regardless of the game time. Fntastic received $0 and will receive nothing from The Day Before sales."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The party poppers are out, the finger food is ready and waiting to be served, and the guest list for Doom's 30th birthday party is well and truly set. Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth's orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let's face it. Doomguy wouldn't be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He'd be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he'd be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. 
So Doom's hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they're having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn't know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000. Here's every classic Doom enemy ranked on a scale of the most miserable wallflowers to the life and (undead) soul of the party.

Apologies, I realise that reference is more appropriate to Paradox's other recent strategy release, Star Trek: Infinite, but I don't know the Stellaris fiction well enough to think of an appropriate in-joke. If you are similarly lacking in Stellaris knowledge, please rejoice in the fact that Nexus is a stripped-down, sped-up, turn-based version of the legendary space sim, which emphasises snappy tactical and strategic relationships over backstory.

Honestly, the idea of remastering an alt-history "199X"-style homage to Half-Life and Doom does a number on my sense of time - which multiversal branch are we in now? Still, those gibbable demon Klansters certainly look swish. Find a comparison trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC back in February – you can read Game Informer's Hogwarts Legacy review here. Now, as 2023 comes to a close, Google has released the top 10 trending searches in games on Google over the year and in the top slot is Hogwarts Legacy.

While many were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and information about the game, there's no doubt some of the Google searching for this game stems from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it's based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it. Nonetheless, it was the subject of many top trending searches on Google. 
As for what that means, Google describes it like so: "This data shows the top trending searches in the U.S., which means the 'trending' inquiries are the searches that had such a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2023 as compared to 2022." 
With that in mind, here's the top 10 trending searches in the U.S. for games on Google in 2023: 
Hogwarts Legacy – Our Review
Connections (if you, like me, didn't know what this was, it's a New York Times word grouping puzzle game) 
Baldur's Gate 3 – Our Review
Starfield – Our Review
Diablo IV – Our Review
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Our Review
Atomic Heart – Our Review
Dead Island 2 – Our Review
Sons of the Forest
Mortal Kombat 1 – Our Review
And here are the top 10 trending searches in the world for games on Google in 2023: 
Hogwarts Legacy
The Last of Us
Connections
Battlegrounds Mobile India
Starfield
Baldur's Gate 3
スイカ ゲーム (a Japanese puzzle game known as Suika Game or Watermelon Game)
Diablo IV
Atomic Heart
Sons of the Forest

It was nominated for Best Family Game at The Game Awards 2023 – check out all the winners here – and now, Dlala has revealed it is launching new content this week. 
More specifically, the Keeper Up update will go live in Disney Illusion Island for free on Wednesday, December 13. It includes new time trial challenges, quality of life updates like an improved map, and more. 

"In this fast-paced new experience, players must try and beat the clock and show off their parkour prowess, thanks to a set of new challenges arranged by the 'Mavens of Monoth,' a group of 'old Monoth' enthusiasts who want to see if anyone knows how to navigate these lands better (and faster) than them," a press release reads. "Upon entering a course, a timer will tick away as players scramble to grab collectibles through remixed areas of the world, making their way to the finish line in the best time possible." 
Elsewhere in the Keeper Up update, Dlala studios says Disney Illusion Island will receive "a host of quality of life updates, including new accessibility features, new gallery unlocks, and an updated map." 
Disney Illusion Island is available exclusively on Switch, and the new Keeper Update goes live this week on December 13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden is a game of twos. It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.
A spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her "Ascend" to the afterlife.

Perhaps it's unsurprising then that a major German PC retailer recorded the 7800X3D as massively outselling any other processor on the market as of late. 
As of today, the best prices available in the UK and US are at Overclockers (£330) and Amazon ($358). Both retailers offer the CPU with a free copy of the truly stunning Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game.

But with the start of this new chapter, the team also launched three new experiences within the Fortnite launcher.

The third and final new experience of Chapter 5 (so far, at least) went live over the weekend – it's called Fortnite Festival and is basically Rock Band-lite but in the universe of Fortnite. 
It launched Saturday, December 9, and allows players to use their various Fortnite skins and cosmetics on the Main Stage and Jam Stage to perform songs like The Killers' "Mr. Brightside" and Lady Gaga's "Bad …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. 
At the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date.

I badly need Crawford's thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment's Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.
In this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you're an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that'll be added on the road to 1.0. Here's the latest trailer.

Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.
Yet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”

There has been some negative feedback, however, from players upset that player movement is now slower than it was during the beta.

Except, it's not slower, say the developers - there have been no changes to the movement system at all. Instead they're investigating why it apparently feels slower, and say they've found the culprits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I helped a friend spec out a gaming PC to play Baldur's Gate 3 and other triple-A releases, and we opted for a machine with an RTX 4070 Ti graphics card as that fit within her £2000 budget and allows for excellent performance with gaming monitors up to 4K while leaving enough cash free for a high-end CPU and other nice components. 
Today though, you can pick up a pre-built RTX 4070 Ti gaming PC for way less than that - just £1299 - when you get it from Stormforce Gaming in the UK. This build includes a 12th-gen Core i5 processor, 16GB of DDR4 memory, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD and a 750W power supply, all for £500 off its listed price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning, in the cold, post-Game Awards light of day, it became apparent to me that, incredible as it seems, some of you out there have taken Geoff Keighley at his word that The Game Awards is something more meaningful than a flashy ad show to make money. I can't really blame you for being an open-hearted optimist, but must ask: have you never watched The Game Awards before? I have, and this year, despite not having had to stay up until 5am covering it, I'm grumpy enough to point out that we don't actually have to be nice about the great, clomping shiny trainer of marketing in 2023, the year everyone was laid off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27, but shortly before its release, developer Remedy Entertainment revealed that it would be getting a New Game Plus mode with an alternative narrative and nightmare difficulty, amongst other things. During The Game Awards 2023 last night, Remedy, which picked up three wins during the show, revealed that "The Final Draft" update, which includes the aforementioned New Game Plus mode, goes live next week. 
More specifically, The Final Draft hits Alan Wake 2 on Monday, December 11. It features a new ending to the story of Alan Wake that Remedy says will spark speculation and theory crafting among its most dedicated fans. Plus, there's new lore to find in the form of new videos and manuscript pages. 


"Players will retain all Weapons, Charms, and character upgrades earned during their first playthrough," a blog post about The Final Draft reads. "They should come in handy when you seek the ultimate challenge of trying out the new Nightmare Difficulty level. Brace yourselves for intensified enemies, strategic gameplay, and an adrenaline-pumping experience that will push your skills to the limit." 
You will find all of your unlocked weapons in the first available shoebox for the characters, so don't expect to immediately start the game with all of your weaponry. 
Remedy says The Final Draft update also includes numerous bug fixes and slight performance optimizations that will be further detailed in the complete update notes, which go live alongside the update on Monday. 
The Final Draft update for Alan Wake 2 goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Monday, December 11, on all platforms where you can play the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards 2023 was a massive night for games, with more than 30 announcements, premieres, and more. It ended with developer Larian Studios taking home the Game of the Year award for its critically acclaimed RPG, Baldur's Gate 3. Shortly after the win, Larian revealed that the game was now available on Xbox Series X/S, meaning it's finally playable on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
 

Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke tweeted, "I had one job and that was to announce this if we won an award – sorry all but happy it's out there," meaning this might have been meant to be an on-stage announcement. Nonetheless, everyone's happy Vincke and the team took the extra time to praise its team of developers and thank fans for the reception during the Game of the Year award acceptance speech instead. 
Xbox players, it’s party time.

More than a year later, developer Interior/Night is bringing the game to PlayStation, but you'll have to wait just a bit longer to play it.
That's because As Dusk Falls hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 7, 2024. Interior/Night announced this news during The Game Awards 2023 tonight. It will also launch on the Epic Games Store and GOG on PC the same day. The studio released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement, and you can check it out for yourself below:


This new PS5 version of As Dusk Falls includes new exclusive features like haptic feedback and touchpad controls. Plus, a new audio description accessibility feature will be available on all platforms in March.
"In this uncompromising crime drama of betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience, players explore the entangled lives of two families across decades, starting in 1998 with a robbery gone wrong in small-town Arizona," a press release reads. "The story can be replayed to discover the vastly different outcomes depending on the decisions taken. As Dusk Falls has an innovative multiplayer mode supporting up to 8 players locally, online, or as a combination of both, using controllers or the companion app for Android or iOS." 
As Dusk Falls won the Games For Impact award at last year's Game Awards. For more about the game, read Game Informer's As Dusk Falls review.

They're called Echoes of the Fallen and Rising Tide, and the former is available to play right now.
Echoes of the Fallen adds new story chapters that takes place before the finale of Final Fantasy XVI. Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.
Zau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.

The world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.
Salim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.
The trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.]]></summary>

There have been beta sessions before now, but the game is getting a full, proper launch next Summer. The exact date is up in the air still, but according to a blog post from the developers, it will be announced as soon as they can pin it down. Check out the latest trailer below.


In The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants – a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets. Your goal is to defend the planet from invaders called Colossi using the game's third-person shooting and RPG mechanics. The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.
There's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Check it out for free when it launches simultaneously on all of those platforms in Summer 2024.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-08T03:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sharkmob, makers of the battle royale Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodhunt, have revealed a new open-world extraction shooter called Exoborne.
The game is a tactical shooter set in an apocalyptic Earth that is being torn asunder by extreme forces of nature, such as massive tornadoes and lightning storms. These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. 


Exoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). 
The gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.
Characters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.
Exborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.]]></summary>

The ambitious space-exploration title promised a universe of possibilities and has since become the poster child for bouncing back from a challenging launch period.
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first teaser trailer, Sean Murray and Hello Games returned to Geoff Keighley's stage, now called The Game Awards, to give a brief retrospective and tease what's next. After a rundown of the last 10 years of active development of No Man's Sky, including several free updates, improvements, and expansions, the trailer teases big plans for 2024, with something that appears to involve more intricate space stations within the game.
Check out the No Man's Sky 10-Year Anniversary Trailer for yourself below: 


No Man's Sky was released in 2016 to mixed reviews but received myriad updates and improvements in the years since, delivering something beyond what was even promised in the lead-up to launch. Today, it is widely praised by critics and fans and is put forward as the foremost model for how to improve a game after a rocky launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years we've published many articles detailing abusive content removal demands and more generally the staggering volume of takedown notices received by the likes of Google and  YouTube. A common complaint by users of these services is the difficulty in finding a real person to discuss their issues when things go wrong. That's something unlikely to change anytime soon because content is being taken down like never before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
