        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["But each collection will continue to grow".
Nintendo has pumped out classic games for its Switch Online service on a consistent basis. There's kind of a pattern, but that doesn't necessarily mean fans should expect the same thing when it comes to the newly released retro libraries.
Axios Gaming co-author Stephen Totilo reached out to Nintendo following the launch of the new Game Boy and Game Boy Advance services for Switch Online to ask it how often fans could expect games to be added to the service. In short: "There is no set schedule for new releases, but each collection will continue to grow."

Video game companies have to deal with a lot of things behind the scenes, and one story that's recently come to light isn't pleasant at all.
According to a translation by Nintendo Everything, Japanese media outlet Kyoto Shimbun reports the arrest of a "36-year-old female permatemp on suspicion of intimidation" on 9th February 2023 for allegedly sending death threats to a Nintendo executive in June last year.

Nintendo surprised pretty much everyone earlier this week when it shadow-dropped Metroid Prime Remastered after years of ongoing rumours.
While most people are satisfied, it seems not everyone out there is happy. Former Retro studios engineer Zoid Kirsch, who recently mentioned how he wasn't very impressed with the quality of the doors in the remaster, has now voiced his frustration about the game's credits - noting how it does not include the full original credits.

It was one-of-a-kind until yesterday, when Double Fine released PsychOdyssey, a 32-episode documentary series charting the creation of Psychonauts 2. Each episode is typically between 20 minutes and an hour long, and I've had a great time watching the first three so far.

Wetrix was an easily overlooked little puzzler. Released in 1998 for the N64 before getting ported to PC and Dreamcast, it was unconventional, to say the least. While the name is probably supposed to remind you of Tetris, there’s a lot more to it than trying to wipe out a wall of tetrominoes. The goal is to wall up areas to hold water, and doing a good job rewards you with ducks. I think we can all agree that ducks are a pretty great reward. They’re like chill geese that won’t drag your child away.
If Wetrix was easily overlooked, its 2000 sequel blended in with the carpeting. Despite enjoying the original and knowing the existence of a follow-up, I only recently got around to trying it. That’s because it’s not named Wetrix 2 in North America. It’s Aqua A…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rules are simply, yet frightening...
Having treated us to a couple of bonafide back-to-back classics in January, retro-loving publisher Hamster is kicking off the new month with something especially obscure for the Arcade Archives, with the arrival of Seta/Allumer's digital card game Magical Speed, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Hitting the Japanese coin-op scene in 1994, Magical Speed is an anime-infused version of the classical "Speed" card game, which sees two players go head-to-head in a race to shed their respective hands as quickly as possible. Players simultaneously attempt to match cards in their deck with the top card in a central pool — constantly pulling from a side deck in a bid to be the first to deplete all cards in hand. It's simpler than yer boy is making it sound, but perhaps not so much when presented in Japanese by shouting anime characters

Magical Speed, which was generally presented in cocktail cabinet form, follows the rules of the tabletop classic but adds cutesy characters and a thin "adventure" storyline, as a hero makes their way through a fantasy kingdom, taking on a variety of opponents. As this Arcade Archives release represents the Japanese ROM, there is no English localization, although an English manual is included. While perhaps the nichest Arcade Archives release in some time, this obscure oddity is worth a look for traditional card game fans. Who knows, you might end up searching for cocktail cabinets on eBay.
Magical Speed is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uh… Hmm…
Mr. Pink, the developer behind Golden Light has announced his latest project, Holy Ocean. It’s shaping up to be – how do I put this politely? – a game.
Holy Ocean is described as an open-world FPS where you explore an ocean of meat on a bicycle. Along the way, you discover islands that look like human body-parts while fighting creatures and bosses. It sounds like Rose, a side character from Golden Light and protagonist of the side-story, Golden Light of Rose, will play a central role. The world is said to be “handmade” and “fully destructible.”
[embed]https://youtu.be/YuYipiUeXjk[/embed]
Mr. Pink has been noodling around with a few concepts lately. He’s shown off a bit of Holy Ocean previously under the name “Goldendola.” Aside from that, Mech Punk is another unique one available on Steam Early Access. He’s also demonstrated a concept for a dog-walking RPG. Sounds like a good way to stretch yourself thin, but Mech Punk gets updated so often, I don’t know how he has time to sleep. I guess a person needs to keep themselves occupied after fleeing Russia.
Golden Light was one of my favorite games released in 2022. The dark-weird, meatpunk style of Mr. Pink is an aesthetic I can get behind, so I’ve been keeping an eye on what’s being worked on.
Holy Ocean is available to be wishlisted on Steam. No release window has been set.

Good morning, friends, and welcome to this week's edition of Whatcha Been Playing? It will be something of a shorter affair this time around, as I'm still technically off work — an endeavor that I have only been somewhat successful in maintaining. But, even when I'm not supposed to be here, I'm still gonna rock up for WBP? Not only is each and everyone one of you more than worth the time and effort, but, hey, I got a streak to maintain. So thanks for showing out this Saturday, and here's to a fine week for you all.
to say...
Playing games for review. I guess that still counts as work, right? But time, tide, and embargoes wait for no man, and thus I've been bouncing between two games in lieu of upcoming reviews. The first is 110 Industries' silly slasher Wanted: Dead, which you can read all about next week, while the second is Inti Creates rat-a-tat-tat anime actioner Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, which is still a little ways away. I have much to say about both of these titles. Still, I'm afraid you'll have to hang on for the obligatory designated timestamp to pass before I can spill the beans on these particularly unique releases.
I love you...
Anywhoooo, I only have a mere two days left on my holiday — a holiday that has whizzed by at ungrateful speed — and thus I better get to trying to enjoy them. I will, of course, be sure to dive into all of your comments, so join the point and tell the community Whatcha Been Playing? There's sure been a lot of news and excitement so far this year, and hopefully, you've found something to get your gaming brain in gear for 2023. Tell us all about it, and share your thoughts. The World wants to hear it. And if it doesn't, we'll just force 'em to listen anyway. We Shall Not Be Denied.
Have a wonderful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.

Phew - this was a pretty busy week, huh?
To kick off the week, we took you through some of the highlights from Nintendo's latest financial report for Q3 of fiscal year 2023. This included the rather stupendous new sales milestone for the Switch, with the console now exceeding Game Boy and PlayStation 4 total sales. We also learned that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had reached twenty million in sales, Splatoon 3 ten million, and Bayonetta 3 one million.

Remember that rumoured Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model that leaked at the end of last year? Well, there's seemingly been a small but significant discovery.
Twitter account Nintendeal has noticed the symbols featured on the 'leaked images' of the rumoured Switch match up with the iconography featured on the Collector's Edition of the game, which was announced earlier this week during a Nintendo Direct presentation.

The collaboration that created Double Fine Adventure is back with a new documentary. Today, 2 Player Productions and Double Fine Productions premiered Double Fine PsychOdyssey, a detailed documentary following the development of Psychonauts 2.
Up on both YouTube and the Internet Archive, Double Fine PsychOdyssey is 32 episodes long, with some pretty hefty runtimes. Alongside following the development of Psychonauts 2, there's also a mini-movie in the middle following Amnesia Fortnight, the studio's special brainstorming and prototyping event it holds every so often.
Much like Double Fine Adventure did with the development of Broken Age, Double Fine PsychOdyssey looks to be a pretty deep and also human look into the creation of a game. You can see a little bit of it in the trailer here.

Making the game
It's good to see transparency in how games are made, and how the people who make them go through the process. You'd be hard-pressed to find as interesting a subject as Double Fine, too.
The development of Psychonauts 2 took a while, and a lot happened for Double Fine over the course of it. Getting a look into how those events panned out, as well as how the team tackled making a sequel to the original Psychonauts, certainly sounds like it would be an interesting watch.
Most of the Double Fine PsychOdyssey episodes are pretty long, so settle in for a watch. But hey, with the weekend ahead, it seems like a great time to settle in and watch a game get made. Find all of the episodes in the playlist here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…]]></summary>

Alan Wake 2 is still in development, but it sounds like its pieces are coming together. Remedy confirms that Alan Wake 2 is fully playable, and will be headed into its polishing stages soon.
In a financial statement to investors, the studio confirms that Alan Wake 2 is coming together. Here's the comment from Remedy CEO Tero Virtala:
"Alan Wake 2 is in full production. The game will soon have all content in place, and it is playable from start to finish. We will then move onto polishing the experience."

The next Alan Wake game was revealed at The Game Awards 2021 and set for a 2023 launch. Now we're here, many months later, and it looks like Remedy is making good progress towards meeting that window.

I have a soft spot for naval warfare. I attribute this to either the hours I pumped into Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2 or that time my appendix decided it was time to come out while I had P.T.O.: Pacific Theatre of Operations rented on SNES. Pleasant memories.
I don’t, however, find myself drawn to naval simulators. I need some time to reflect on this thought, but in the meantime, Waves of Steel figured out a way to ramp over that barrier and into my heart. It just needed a way to make naval warfare more radical.

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…]]></summary>

Now (as is tradition) Nintendo has released an official infographic, showing everything that went down at the event.
Posted on Twitter, Nintendo is putting those aforementioned big hitters at the forefront alongside the upcoming Splatoon 3 DLC, but this isn't to say that there aren't goodies to be found on the later rows. We've got the surprise reveals of Professor Layton and the New World of Steam and Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, as well as all of the titles soon to get an expansion such as Fire Emblem Engage, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

The Harry Potter franchise has seen tremendous ups and downs: the likes of which stand out even among other multi-billion-dollar franchises. I remember reading the first book in a day (the first time I had ever done that) and witnessing the long lines at book stores every time a sequel would hit the shelves. With how fractured media is now, we may not ever see a collective phenomenon like that again in our lifetime. I also recall barely containing my laughter at an insanely convoluted plot point in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald; and, after hearing someone describe the core of Cursed Child, refusing to believe it was actually real.
Hogwarts Legacy lies somewhere in the middle of that wild ride.

It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the 'correct' solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. 
Then it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.

The Sheikah Slate. Breakable weapons of varying degrees of annoyance, and more. A change not often discussed was Link’s lack of a companion.
Since The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Link has generally travelled with a buddy that gives him advice — like how to target enemies — along with narrative exposition. In Breath of the Wild, Link adventured alone with only the odd suggestion from his Sheikah Slate, creating a breathtakingly lonely adventure. If what we’ve seen of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is anything to go by, we likely aren’t getting another buddy to travel with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All my friends are heathens
Saint Maker, the new visual novel from Yangyang Mobile, is set to drop on PC and Switch on February 22, 2023. The press release tells me that this date is significant because it’s Ash Wednesday, but as a Canadian, that just tells me that February 21st is Pancake Tuesday.
I probably lost a fair few of you at the word “Mobile,” but it’s necessary to highlight this game for a very important reason: Yangyang Mobile is the developer that brought us Perfect Gold, a game that came out in 2021 that I still haven’t shut up about.
[embed]https://youtu.be/pcLijhOfBbI[/embed]
However, while Perfect Gold was a beautiful yuri love story, Saint Maker has its sights set on horrifying you rather than warming your heart. It tells the story of Holly Beltran, who is attending a recollection at Saint Idelora’s convent when she starts witnessing strange hauntings. Saint Maker revolves around religious horror with a psychological twist. While there are interactive choices to be made, Yangyang Mobile has pegged the game at around 60,000 words and estimates it will take 4-6 hours to complete. Great information!
While I would have been perfectly content if Yangyang Mobile wanted to keep feeding me yuri romance, I’m down for a little variety. This isn't their first foray into the horror genre, as they previously released The Letter in 2017.
Saint Maker will be available on PC and Switch on February 22nd. It will be available for $13.99, but you can enjoy a 20% discount during its launch week.

Speaking pedantically, this isn't "as simple as it gets", but you'll get what I mean if I describe it that way anyway. You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way. These are far from my favourite genre, but I've played enough to realise I'm partial to a good one, and this is a great one.

Metroid Prime Remastered brings the GameCube classic to Switch in fine fashion. Retro Studios, with the help of multiple additional developers, has updated the original game significantly for the Switch, implementing revamped visuals, an expanded gallery features, and multiple new control options.
Of course, one of these control options allows you to effectively replicate the original 'Classic' GameCube controls on Switch with Joy-Con or a Switch Pro Controller. But what if you wanted to go all the way and use an actual GameCube pad with Metroid Prime Remastered? Could you really do it?

Just last week, Ubisoft delayed the game’s imminent Season 11 launch due to localisation issues that had been “impacting the experience for many players.” But in the process of fixing that issue, Ubisoft had accidentally “brought down the build generation system,” meaning that no updates were possible until the system was rebuilt. At least they’re being honest.

Big news for cooking fans in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Gameloft has said that one of the most popular features — limitless coal — is returning to Kristoff's Stall in the next update, which drops on 16th February.
Coal is used for cooking, and it's normally hard to get high quantities of this, so it'll be a huge help for those who use cooking to make big bucks in-game. That's not the only change coming to the stall, either, as Gameloft teased that Kristoff will also be expanding his item limits "across the board".

A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.
All of those parts are present, and as a bonus it's incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.
Of all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.

When I started the Octopath Traveler II demo from this week’s Nintendo Direct, I thought “well, this is certainly more Octopath Traveler.” I technically wasn't wrong, but I was massively underestimating what I was getting into.

This initially filled with me trepidation. Octopath Traveler is a game I like well enough. After all, I even got invested in the mobile spinoff last year. But it was a game that I took in bite-sized doses. I loved the artstyle and the battle system, but it didn’t have that special something that hooked me like the golden age RPGs it was trying to invoke. I was…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime example.
It’s difficult to believe now, but there was once a time when the notion of a first-person Metroid game seemed unfathomable. Prior to the release of Metroid Prime back in 2002, the franchise had been confined to the 2D realm, with complex environments full of secrets and hidden equipment that bolstered your abilities and combat potential as you explored. The idea that Retro Studios, an entirely new entity at the time, could not only successfully reimagine the franchise in a 3D space but also implement a first-person perspective was frankly absurd. Yet the team accomplished it spectacularly, crafting what remains to this day one of the finest GameCube games of all time.
Now, more than 20 years later, Metroid Prime has been remastered for the Nintendo Switch, and Retro Studios has proven why it’s consistently considered one of the most talented developers in the business (though the studio did have help from a number of other devs for this one). This is a stunning revamp from top to bottom, and although there are a few minor niggles here and there, we feel confident enough to say that Metroid Prime Remastered is a bonafide masterpiece and an absolutely essential addition to your Switch library.

But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.

Earlier this week we got a look at Nintendo's Q3 financial figures for FY 2023 and there were some big milestones crossed — Switch outselling the Game Boy, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe passing 50 million sales and much more besides. All this pointed towards a Q&A session with the company's directors that would be looking to the future of the console, unpacking what's to come next and maybe giving a hint at some projects in the pipeline.
Well, the Q&A has today been published and the contents are... not quite as fulfilling as we would have hoped.

When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.

We're still pinching ourselves that Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster is real. Revealed during the February 2023 Direct, the remaster contains both GameCube RPGs in one package. And, shortly after the collection was announced, publisher Bandai Namco published a short Q&A detailing what this remaster entails.
One point of contention many had with the first game, Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, is the voice over. The English dub has some notorious voice acting issues which sound like the voices have been recorded through a tin can. And in this Q&A, Bandai Namco has stated that the collection will only have Japanese voiceover.

Nintendo yesterday bolstered its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service with some new retro libraries. Now, following on from this, it appears to have updated its official "overview trailer" for the service in its homeland of Japan. Within it, you can see footage of the Game Boy Advance library.
In addition to this, it's also shown off some footage of the 2023 wave of N64 titles including games from the Mario Party and Pokémon Stadium series, as well as Excitebike 64. While there's not much remaining in this original wave of N64 games, it seems they are at least on course for a release in the near future.

Nintendo launched the long-rumoured Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance Switch Online libraries earlier this week. As usual, it seems Japan's offerings are slightly different.
In the Japanese versions of these apps, the Game Boy application has swapped out Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare with the 1989 release Yakuman (Mahjong). This title was originally a launch title for the system and was never made available outside of Japan.

I'm not sure when Radio the Universe first caught my attention, but it didn't look the way it looks now. The game's Kickstarter page went live in 2012, and backer rewards were expected to ship in 2014; that obviously didn't happen, and in the years since, I've gone back and forth on whether or not I expect the game to release at all. Developer 6E6E6E's updates have been infrequent and vague, and the last update to the game's itch.io page arrived nearly three years ago.
Part of me was very anxious when I heard that a Radio the Universe demo would be available during Steam Next Fest. I haven't spent a decade actively imagining the game, but I have been thinking about it for quite some time, and it's always tough for a game to live up to mounting expectations…]]></summary>

Likewise, the Octopath Traveler 2 demo which was released on console yesterday was nowhere to be found on PC.

Uh, until today. It's out on Steam now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maps, taunts and more in store for this summer
Sun, vacations, songs; there are plenty of reasons to look forward to the summer. Team Fortress 2 fans just got another reason though, as Valve has confirmed it's working on an update for Team Fortress 2 set to arrive this summer.
In a blog post across its channels, the TF2 team at Valve has put out a call for Steam Workshop submissions. Now, Team Fortress 2 has had many summer updates, and the last few have been largely focused on items. But according to Valve, this one's a bit different.
"The last few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates. But this year, we're planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update — with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?! Which means we need Steam Workshop content! YOUR Steam Workshop content!"

So yes, a full-on update is on the way for Team Fortress 2. Submissions for the Steam Workshop portion are open up to May 1, for this summer-situated (but not necessarily summer-themed) update.
Back to the fort
Team Fortress 2 is arguably a herald of a genre that would become the team-based hero shooter, adding individual skills and characters to a team-focused FPS contest. The result was a classic that garnered many, many fans over the years.
Still, the game languished over time, and last year fans rallied for a #SaveTF2 campaign, calling for Valve to address the botting issues that had run rampant through Team Fortress 2. Valve did respond, and started to take steps towards fixing the issues.
Now, Team Fortress 2 fans may actually have a new update to look forward to. I'm interested to see how large of an update this will be, but it's at least a pulse of life that might draw some lapsed fans back into the realm of Team Fortress 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An older Atelier entry gets a modern update
One of the earlier entries in the Atelier series is getting remade for current systems. Atelier Marie Remake reimagines the original Atelier Marie: The Alchemist of Salburg, and it arrives for Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC this summer.
The news arrived yesterday during the Japanese broadcast of the Nintendo Direct. While it wasn't shown in the English-language Direct, Koei Tecmo America has launched a site saying that the remake will arrive this summer. We reached out and a Koei Tecmo representative confirmed that this summer is the worldwide release window.
Here's the trailer from yesterday's Direct:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAfHby0zw74
The original Atelier Marie was the first in the now long-running Atelier series. First released in 1997 for the PlayStation, then later ported to Sega Saturn and Windows, it is the origin of the series. It follows Marie's quest to create something outstanding, to stand out in her class.
Back to the origin
With the Atelier series seeming to pick up steam in the west with each new entry, it's neat to see Koei Tecmo return to its roots. While Atelier Marie has seen many ports over the years, this starting slice of the series hasn't seen an official North American release yet.
For fans of the workshop-driven RPG series, this could be a good chance to see how it all started, but with a fresh update and look that adheres closer to recent entries like Ryza and Sophie.
Meanwhile, Atelier Ryza 3 was originally slated to arrive this month. But the team recently announced it's taking a one-month delay and pushing the third entry in Ryza's adventure back to March 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of them, actually
I will never say no to a rhythm game spinoff. I am, of course, a loud and unashamed fan of the genre. I'm always down for more rhythm games, but I'm especially fond of titles that recontextualize the music found in other games. I think nearly every video game would benefit from a supplemental mechanical examination of its soundtrack.
But obviously, some franchises are more suited to rhythm gaming than others. If I were to make a list of the greatest video game series soundtracks of all time, it would probably include Metroid and Halo, but those scores aren't exactly full of toe-tappers. So while I would play a rhythm game based on absolutely any soundtrack, I'd like to outline the franchises I think truly deserve the Theatrhythm treatment.

The Wolf Among Us is one of the most popular narrative games from Telltale Games, with a sequel hopefully coming in 2023. Players play The Big Bad Wolf acting as Sheriff in Fabletown, a neighborhood in New York City populated by famous fable characters. The game looks like a comic book and feels like a gritty noir detective story. But with talking animals.

They say it’s “falling” in love because you eventually hit the ground. If a recent bump has you feeling vindictive, Yacht Club Games might have the catharsis for you. They’re hosting a Valentine’s Day event through the Steam version of Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon that will give you the opportunity to squash your ex like the horrible insect they are.
The idea is simple. Send in the name of the object of your derision via a Google Survey I’ll link below before February 13th. All of the names will be collected and dropped into and upcoming preview update. Then, on Valentine’s Day, the Beetos that spawn will be renamed with monikers from the list of ex-lovers. That’ll teach them to play games with your heart.
[caption id="attachment_362484" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Yacht Club Games[/caption]
Here are the details:
Send us your ex’s first name via this Google Survey by 2/13!
We’ll input all of the submitted names into our upcoming Puzzler’s Pack DLC Early Preview update on Steam.
On Valentine’s Day (02/14/23), the squashing spree will begin!
This Steam-only event is all for fun, so we’ll remove all the names after the event. The event will officially end on 2/15/23!
The event is free, so long as you own Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon on Steam, so it’s the perfect time to get back at Chad for sleeping with your cousin at your grandfather’s funeral. Or whatever it is he did.
I don’t really have the need to squash any of my exes. They tend to range from, “well, that was unfortunate,” to, “I would rather just never see them again.” However, my dating life was rather uneventful, so maybe you’ve got someone who deserves to be flattened.
Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon is available on PC, Mac, PS4, and Switch, but the Squash your Ex event is exclusive to the Steam version.

Nowadays, PCIe 4.0 drives are becoming more common and PCIe 5.0 is on the horizon, but the SX8200 Pro - in a newer 2TB size - is still an awesome value for the performance on offer. It's down to £117 at TechNextDay when you use code TND-10, a healthy £35 below the next-lowest price at CCL.

Six months of patches and performance improvements later, and these GPUs look even better - especially as neither AMD or Nvidia has launched mainstream desktop graphics cards from their most recent generation. 
 Today, the cheaper of the two cards, the Arc A750, is available for £250 plus shipping at Overclockers UK, a steep £80 reduction from their £330 launch price.

We've seen the video game pricing debate play out time and again. Every time a studio bumps up the price of a major release, people comment on how things are getting out of hand, other people counter that video game prices actually rise very slowly relative to other luxury goods, and so on and so forth. Unsurprisingly, when Nintendo revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom would retail for $69.99, this debate returned. The good news is, you probably don't actually need to pay $69.99 for Tears of the Kingdom.

I’m very affectionate toward the N64 to the point where I consider it my main stomping ground. It wasn’t my first console, but something about it speaks to me beyond just nostalgia. Despite that, I’m quick to point out its shortcomings. The PlayStation, for being a much less powerful console at the time, has aged much more gracefully. The PlayStation’s visual quirks are often charming. Graphics on the N64 look like a dog has been licking the screen.
Nonetheless, the N64 had a personality, and it’s one that seems difficult to mimic successfully. As someone who is so well indoctrinated by the hardware and so familiar with all its eccentricities, I’m difficult to fool and jaded to the point where I’m tough to impress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A date with the night
As part of the February 8th Nintendo Direct, Motion Twin has revealed the release date for the DLC for the 2018 Rogue-Lite platformer, Dead Cells, will be March 6, 2023. Return to Castlevania makes the assumption that you’ve been there in the first place and takes The Prisoner to the world of Castlevania. There, you’ll team up with Richter Belmont and Alucard to take down Death and Dracula.
Considering that Dead Cells owes part of its “RogueVania” design to the seminal Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the crossover seems like a great fit. Not only that, but Konami and GuruGuru recently lifted a portion of Dead Cells design for GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon. First comes love, then comes marriage.
[embed]https://youtu.be/ZSZ0qY6FRgw[/embed]
The trailer shows off the inspiration. Music, locations, bosses, and weapons have all been lifted from the surrogate franchise and transplanted into Dead Cells. The lo-fi visuals really fit well with the Castlevania flavor. The appearance of Alucard and Richter is a welcome treat for fans like myself, and the boss battle against Dracula really takes me into Castlevania’s weird image of Romania.
I played a bit of Dead Cells as a point of reference for when I was playing GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon. Since I’m such a huge Castlevania fan, the Return to Castlevania DLC might be just what I need to dive further into it.
Dead Cells is available on mobile, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The Return to Castlevania DLC will drop on March 6th, and will run you $9.99.

Whenever there is a Nintendo Direct, it always pays to hop over to the Japanese YouTube channel afterward to check out some of the games that didn't make it into the English-speaking shows. Sometimes, the Japanese Nintendo Direct will have previews of games that eventually release worldwide. During yesterday's show, there were a couple of games in it that didn't show up in the western versions, including a new entry in the My Summer Vacation series.
Google-translated as Natsu-mon 20th Century Summer Vacation, the game puts players in the shoes of a ten-year-old boy as he celebrates a month of summer in a quiet seaside town. Like with other My Summer Vacation games, the boy will be able to catch fish and bugs to track in his journal. He'll also be able to take a train to another town, help out with a circus troupe, and visit a night market. Unlike past games in the franchise, this one won't rely on pre-rendered screens.

It is an absolute toss-up as to whether or not Natsu-mon 20th Century Summer Vacation will make it out of Japan. Last year, curious westerns were thrown a bone with the worldwide release of Shin-chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey-. While the Shin-chan character designs might have been a turn-off for those who don't care for the series, the gameplay was a delightfully laid-back experience. I'm holding onto hope that Spike Chunsoft finds a way to localize this charming-looking game in the future.
Just maybe give it a less ridiculous name this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot (most) of the magic games we're highlighting this week are in some manner lovely and nice, because witches these days tend towards the cottagecore (ily, Little Witch In The Woods!). It's nice that witches have changed in our minds to "unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]", when they used to be "unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil".
There's still room for witches with some threat to 'em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It's a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. "In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits," solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. "During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one's home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house."

If you've read any of my writing over the last eight-ish years I've worked here, you probably know I have a deep affinity for the Style Savvy series. The boutique management sim has had me wrapped around its finger since the original game debuted on the Nintendo DS. The game looked rough on the hardware, and the real-time clock didn't do it any favors, but it was fabulous nonetheless. The series really hits its stride when it jumped to the 3DS. Both Style Savvy: Trendsetters and Style Savvy: Styling Star ranked among the very best experiences I had on the console. I've been wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin' the series would show up on Switch, and while there have been a few fashion games over the life of the console, nothing has really grabbed…]]></summary>

It's been more than four and a half years since Altus dropped a short trailer that seemed to indicate the Etrian Odyssey series would live on in a post-two-screen gaming world. One of the most celebrated creations of the Nintendo DS and 3DS eras, it's been all quiet on the western from Atlus on the status of this series since that trailer dropped. During yesterday's Nintendo Direct, the developer made it loud and clear it hadn't forgotten about its niche dungeon crawler with the reveal of Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection.

Looking at both the popular upcoming demo list and the most wishlisted list, survival crafting game Voidtrain sits comfortably in second place on both. I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.
I thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it's actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain's Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.

It's been a rough couple of years for Level-5. Considered one of the stronger development houses in Japan, it's struggled recently to reach the worldwide audience it once did. It also bought Comcept for some reason. Anyway, the studio has seen just a few titles make it over the Pacific in the past couple of years, including Snack World: The Dungeon Crawl – Gold and Fantasy Life Online. Others, like new entries in its once-popular Yo-kai Watch series or its Megaton Musashi games, have stayed put in Japan. Add in the fact that Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road of Heroes has been terminally delayed over the years, and it very well seemed like the company was slowly wilting from this world.

On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.]]></summary>

The other entry, Baten Kaitos Origins, or Baten Kaitos 2 in Japan, takes place two decades prior to the first and follows Sagi, a spiriter with connections to both the Guardian Spirits and the Alfard Empire.

First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector's Edition. This bundle features the physical version of the game, an artbook with concept art, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges.

Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link's paraglider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream, the company gave a new look at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.  
You're going to immediately jump past this paragraph to the trailer below, so here are the quick bits you need to know: there's rail grinding akin to Sonic and Splatoon, a new homing arrow, a big, dumb goofy car Link can drive and a new hoverboard, and all around the game continues to look great. 
Here's the trailer:


While we're at it, here's a whole host of new screenshots. 

Tears of the Kingdom will be released on May 12, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has been very robust in its support of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, regularly bringing out new content for enthusiastic racers over the last year to keep the experience fresh. That trend continues with the upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4, which is targeting a release later this spring.
While we don’t have all the details, today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a look at the new course set on Yoshi’s Island, which looks just as whimsical and fun as that locale ever has. We also learned that Birdo is joining the roster of available racers – the one-time Mario foe first appeared in a Mario Kart game with Double Dash, and so this appearance is a return to the road.
Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service are able to access the new Booster Course Pass Wave 4 for no additional cost, but the pass is also available for separate purchase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp will be released on April 21, as announced today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream. 
Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was pushed to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn't happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay "in light of recent world events," perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time. 
Check out a trailer below.


Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a remake of the Game Boy Advance games Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. It's being developed by WayForward, known for its work on the Shantae series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a new look at Sabotage Studio’s Sea of Stars. This follow-up game to The Messenger is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI. 
Sea of Stars features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
The new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.
Sea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.
The game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.
Check out the new trailer below.]]></summary>

The news comes by way of today's Nintendo Direct. The cult favorite mystery game has been remastered in HD, and presumably, the gameplay has been reworked, given it was developed for the dual-screened DS. The Capcom-developed adventure game follows Sissel, who passes away under mysterious circumstances. It's up to his ghost to figure out how he died by way of solving puzzles.

Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.
We see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.
Nintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.]]></summary>

No date or details were offered for the second wave, but it showed a Squid Kid in what appeared to be a snow-covered city. It also seems to have a more melancholy, sad tone. The second wave will be called Side Dish.

Those were the words of Capcom's Yasuhiro Ampo, co-director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game's magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team's approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. 
Ampo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil. Their combined credits span the original 1996 game to titles such as Resident …]]></summary>

Well done you. This year, I ask you to decide between a cool (and sometimes practical) form of violence and a fun risk/reward element. What's better: throwing knives or active reload?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't mean to alarm anyone, but I think Urbo might be my Dorfromantik of 2023. It's a chill, citybuilding puzzle game from the devs behind the altogether more violent Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and it's all about building tiny little villages on top of rocky outcrops. Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It's very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since the first bundle arrived in 2014, The Jackbox Party Pack has been a staple in many households when friends and family come over. The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.
Like its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don't know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
On top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.
The Jackbox Party Pack 10 arrives on all major platforms this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken players still exploring Athia or those hoping to jump in the future should be happy to know that developer Luminous Productions has announced an impending patch to make the adventure smoother across the board. 
In a statement by game director Takeshi Aramaki, the update will improve Forspoken’s graphics, performance, and playability while also adding “general updates” and fixes to both the PS5 and PC versions. There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. 
“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
Forspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bullet hell shooters have never been one of my fortes in games. There is certainly something magical about watching masters of the genre weave effortlessly in and out of flying orbs in the likes of Gradius, R-Type and Ikaruga, but whenever I attempt to step up to the gamepad myself, my movements have always proven too flighty, too seized by panic, to make much headway with them. Enter The Knight Witch, which takes the thrill of the bullet hell shooter and wraps it up in a lovely Metroid-like-shaped package my brain can actually understand. It's a fantastic little game, and I'm only sorry we didn't cover it in more detail when it came out at the end of November last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends is going to look a little different in a week's time. Respawn have broken the mould a little bit with Apex Legends Revelry and the game's four year anniversary - instead of adding a new Legend as usual, they've spent their time elsewhere to bring a host of Legend meta and weapon meta changes, alongside the new Team Deathmatch game mode and improving player onboarding that we reported on earlier in the week.
Apex Legends Season 16 is going to break a surprising number of targeted adjustments to various different guns, Legends, and abilities. And all that on top of the entirely revamped Legend class system, which gives every Legend a brand new perk (or in some cases two!) to play with. Read on for a full list of all the major changes that are coming to Legends and weapons with Apex Legends Revelry.

It takes your mouse and turns it into a sword, or a shield, or an arm that's capable of swatting away an explosive potion. It may be like something you, dear reader, have played in the past, but me? Nah, never played anything quite like it! Well, that's a lie. If anything, it's the first fantasy RPG that's made use of my latent - and highly dubious - CS:GO skills and brought to mind a rhythm game called Osu! I am very impressed indeed.

The CMA say the buyout “could result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation for UK gamers.” Since these concerns are provisional, both parties will have a chance to respond before the CMA makes its final decision on April 26th. Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard believe the deal will encourage competition in the gaming space, rather than hinder it.

It’s a 19th-century witch sim being made by Emberstorm Entertainment, where you play as a traveling witch whose chosen mode of transportation is the legendary chicken-legged Baba Yaga house, which is the coolest thing ever.

Details on Reka are still super light, and the Steam page mentions a release year of 2024, but I’ve been following Emberstorm’s Twitter intently, looking at all the cool gifs for Reka and the house looks incredible! For one, it’s huge. It towers above the forest trees and looks like it could easily stomp unwanted visitors to death. When the young witch approaches the towering beast, it bends is legs to sit down, almost burring itself in the earth for her access to the house on top.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/02/08/cities-skylines-gets-remastered-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-next-week"/>
        <updated>2023-02-08T09:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.
This new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.
Perhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.
You can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.


Cities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.]]></summary>

The same is nearly true of this sequel set on the Red Planet, though its larger scope magnifies its problems. Thankfully, a captivating narrative does its best to keep this flawed mission on track.

Oh, what's this hiding down the back of the sofa? Why, it's Blade And Sorcery, a VR game about hacking people to death in a virtual environment. How fortunate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know, I always figured I’d be great at making potions. As a kid, I was obsessed with pulling things out of cupboards and combining them into a bowl. Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. 


As I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.

Tune in at 2 p.m. PST tomorrow, Feb. 8, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2023.
https://t.co/8ce3reaEig pic.twitter.com/Pmf41dQWIw
February 7, 2023
The event runs for around 40 minutes and will highlight Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. In terms of notable first and third-party exclusives that we already know about, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon fall under that range. It’s plausible we’ll also see one last push for indies coming to Switch soon, such as Have a Nice Death, Ib, and Storyteller. 
Given that this is Nintendo, it's always possible they'll announce a big game out of nowhere that winds up launching soon after its reveal. What do you expect/hope to see in tomorrow's Direct? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

It's a great DLC, not just because it has loads of nods to the older Tomb Raider games, but also because if you're just in it for the powerwashing, you've got some lovely levels to clean, with nooks and crannies and satisfying walls to scour. My favourite thing about it, however, is that it kind of canonically confirms Lara is an ass.

So, obviously, the natural choice to replace Commander Shepard is… Michael Scott? Someone made a video editing The Office’s nutty boss into scenes from the Mass Effect trilogy, and the results are hilarious.

The town is preparing for a festival and, as the newly appointed town witch, you need to pull your weight by brewing potions, giving tarot readings, and even leading a guided meditation session or two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy is prepping for release on February 10, but the provided review code allowed for a review embargo that was lifted earlier today. After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.
In that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix. For gamers familiar with the books or movies, it’s great fun to explore the massive cast…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending a couple of years coming together in early access, Darkest Dungeon II is ready to go 1.0 this May. Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by downloading a free demo today.
Darkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.
Heroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. 
You can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store. To learn more, check out our feature on the game's new hero, the Runaway and a list of its most challenging enemies thus far.]]></summary>

This season delivers several facets of new content, including a new Antarctica Control map, Asian Mythology theme, and a Kiriko Mythic skin. On top of that, Blizzard announced some unexpected additions to its Overwatch offerings, including the first IP collaboration as well as a web-based game to coincide with Valentine's Day.

Antarctica joins the map rotation in Season 3. While players are already familiar with Earth's least-populated continent through Ecopoint: Antarctica, this map features unique locations, including an ice-breaker ship and an underground drilling station. The map allows players to take the high-ground or sneaky flank routes to reach their objectives.

When asked whether players would be able to befriend NPCs like other Stardew-likes, Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström told us: "In short, yes. We don't have a full town like Stardew, but the characters that are there, you'll be able to get to know better and learn their stories."

Original story: A new week means one thing: another update on Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. According to a report from The New York Times, Microsoft is expecting the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to oppose the deal, after EU regulators issued their own antitrust warnings last week. Microsoft reportedly believes it can convince EU and UK regulators to accept their concessions and eventually approve the acquisition.

At a recent ID@Xbox showcase we attended last week, creative director and Wishfully co-founder Adam Stjärnljus acknowledged that Playdead connection, saying that both Limbo and Inside "had a huge impact on me". But he also said Studio Ghibli's animated film Spirited Away was another key influence, which, yep, that definitely tracks. 
"I was very inspired by Studio Ghibli films, and especially the film Spirited Away," Stjärnljus told us. "That's been kind of like a guiding star from the beginning in terms of tonality with this serious, emotional story, but [also] still, like, a fun quirkiness to it, and really this sense of exploring another world, which we really want."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night's Grammy awards ceremony was the first ever to include a category for the best score soundtrack for a video game, and last year's Assassin's Creed Valhalla expansion, Dawn of Ragnarok, took home the win. 
More specifically, the DLC's composer, Stephanie Economou, won the Grammy for her score in the game. Her other credits include Netflix's Jupiter's Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked "all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence," thanking them for "acknowledging and validating the power of game music." 


Variety also reports that prior to this year's Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show's score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012's Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Economou's Grammy was awarded during the main show's pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game's name last night is any indication.

Come and find out which ones have stood the test of time, and which, after reading this article, have been consigned to the smog-filled trashfire of future Earth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hesitate to call Potion Tales a shop sim or retail management game, because the economics of running a figuratively and literally underground magic potion shop seems a secondary concern next to making the potions and deciding whether you want to screw people over or not. If the answer to that last part is yes, you need to move on to the question of how.
In practice, Potion Tales is a 3D puzzle game. People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you're approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That's all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

Naughty Dog announced yesterday that their shroomy shooter has been delayed.

        <updated>2023-02-03T23:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, we saw a new teaser trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.
In this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.
To this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7. For more, check out our reaction to the last full trailer during a recent episode of All Things Nintendo.]]></summary>

This Duke wasn't the purple-shirted acrobat I'd known from Apogee Software's pair of platformers earlier that decade. He was brash, crude, and and didn't side-scroll anymore. It wasn't for me, so I moved on to other games. I still occasionally loaded up those earlier platformers though, wistfully remembering a time when Duke presumably used actual toilets when he needed to answer a call of nature.

        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

Capcom renovated Resident Evil 2 from the ground up into a modernized third-person action game. Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit my personal Game of the Year for 2019 to see how it holds up while discussing my Resident Evil 4 cover story.

Good gravy, did I love that case. Tightly proportioned without being too cramped for a full-size graphics card, maturely designed without looking dull, and hewn from some of most gorgeously textured matte steel I’ve seen on a piece of computing hardware. Don’t even get me started on the upgraded Source 340 Elite. It’s been years since these cases disappeared from sale and ascended to Component Heaven, and although it’s taken a few tries, there’s finally a new chassis that’s worthy of the legacy: the NZXT H5 Flow.

Historically, I have fallen hard for two kinds of VN: emotionally probing character dramas like Eliza and Watch Me Jump, or gentle and slightly silly comedies like Laura Silver and Camp W. The jokey dating-sim-but-everyone's-a-talking-table type vein never quite grabbed me. Unless Monster Prom counts? Hmm.

Raptor Boyfriend is more the lighthearted comedy kind, but with through lines on social anxiety and navigating confusing coming-of-age relationships. It is also not actually about having a raptor boyfriend.

Naughty Dog wants more time to polish up the PC port, as stated in a message posted to Twitter that you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
The Last of Us Part I launched for PlayStation 5 last fall and serves as a ground-up remake of the 2013 title. It features improved graphics, reworked controls, improved enemy A.I., and a remade version of the Left Behind DLC chapter. The remake helped usher in the premiere of The Last of Us HBO series last month, which has been heavily watched and received heaps of praise thus far. The show’s second season has already been confirmed.

I’m 21 and my knees click, which means I must be turning into stone faster than someone having a staring contest with Medusa. So, I vowed to exercise a few times a week. Then, during my first week back at work, vid bud Liam told me to try Age Of Empires II. Never before has a New Year’s Resolution been abandoned so fast. I really wanted to stick with it. Promise.
But! After my first match, the following 30 hours vanished quicker than the Galaxy Caramels in a box of Celebrations. I became obsessed. I mastered AOE II's low AI difficulties and quickly used the Advanced Techniques tutorial to learn build orders. Before I knew it, I had a Google Doc filled with step-by-step plans for various playstyles, the perfect strategies for any scenario. But that Google Doc ended up ruining everything for me. If that recent Xbox release with the good gamepad controls has you tempted to revisit Age Of Empires II on PC, do not make a Google Doc. You’ve been warned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last few weeks have been messy for The Day Before, the survival MMO that was Steam’s most wishlisted game for much of 2022. Last month, The Day Before’s Steam page was quietly removed from the storefront following a trademark dispute. Developer Fntastic also delayed the game from March 1st to November 10th at the same time, just days before they promised to show some raw gameplay footage of it in action. The whole debacle led to accusations on Reddit and Discord that the game didn’t even exist, but at long last, that promised gameplay video has arrived. And... it’s merely fine.

It's also getting a Steam Next Fest demo next week on February 6th, which gives you access to its chunky tutorial and the early portion of its campaign, plus the Historic Battle of The Battle Of Passchendaele, which is the mission I got a chance to play at the end of last year. As it turns out, I've also had a sneak peek at the Next Fest build, too, and there's a heck of a lot to sink your teeth into. Here's a small glimpse of what to expect.

There’s something meditative about being close to the water, waiting in silence for a catch, and mashing buttons to reel them in - plus I don’t need to deal with the horrendous smell from behind the safety of my desk. The indie game Dredge subverts what I like about fishing games, with an eerie eldritch horror waiting beneath the ocean’s surface. We won’t need to wait long before we see what's under there as Dredge releases on March 30th.

The studio announced in February of last year that Knockout City was going free-to-play and saying goodbye to Electronic Arts, who originally published the game as an EA Originals title, to self-publish the game's future content. That free-to-play launch happened last June with the start of Season 6 and now, Velan has announced that it will shut the game down in June of this year. More specifically, Knockout City will be shutdown on June 6.

It definitely comes from a place of accessibility, where an onslaught of timed bars and coloured symbols can be intimidating for casual players. But what about the rest of us who want to be pummelled to death in time with a catchy beat?
Good news! TinyBuild's new action-adventure game Rhythm Sprout: Sick Beats & Bad Sweets does not hold back. I'm not even halfway through the game and I’ve had my butt completely kicked by its barrage of oncoming beats, and all in perfect time to its soda-pop EDM.

WWE 2K22 relaunched the franchise on the right foot, and 2K23 aims to build upon that success. The improvements and additions from last year’s game remain intact and expanded in some cases. The legendary John Cena gives his blessing of sorts by gracing the game's cover and starring in the centerpiece Showcase mode. That’s all well and good, but the addition of the long-requested WarGames match may be 2K23’s most exciting bullet point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts has reportedly canceled a single-player game set in the shared Apex Legends and Titanfall universe. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that three people familiar with the matter say EA canceled the project, code-named TFL or Titanfall Legends, that was in development at Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment. Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. 


The publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. 
It's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title."
Word of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April.
