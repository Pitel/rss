        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[See what's next for RGG Studio
Another developer is joining the list of showcases set for next week. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the developer behind the Yakuza and Judgment series, is hosting the RGG Summit 2022 on September 14.
The RGG Summit will air on Sega's Twitch channel, going live at 19:00 JST. That's 10:00 UTC, or 3:00 a.m. PT for those on the west coast. East coasters have it a little bit easier, with a 6 a.m. ET air time.
For those who are awake and tuned in, the stream will have live English interpretation and subtitled assets for those outside of Japan.
https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1567830960133099520
No indication's been given yet as to what will be announced. Though, given the recent tease of some footage from the next Yakuza, that seems like a likely candidate.
The studio has confirmed it's working on the next Yakuza game already. It will be a follow-up to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, and it will retain a turn-based RPG approach.
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will also be without Toshihiro Nagoshi, who left the company and has established Nagoshi Studio under NetEase. It'll be interesting to see what's next for Ichiban and the crew, and the Yakuza series in general, if we get a glimpse during the RGG Summit.
Summer's end gaming news blitz
That's far from the only showcase next week, too. Next week is the 2022 Tokyo Game Show, and companies like Capcom, Square Enix, and Bandai Namco are all lined up to air streams.
Xbox and Twitch are also airing a showcase next week for ID@Xbox, too. This weekend will even have a Marvel and Disney showcase, and an Ubisoft Forward. Plus, the ever-present rumors of a potential September Direct (which may or may not be happening, who's to say).
With the holiday season just over the horizon, seems like we're getting one last wave of gaming news and announcements. We'll see what RGG Studio has in store next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think it has sommelier-m assist?
Train simulators, farming simulators, even goat simulators — here I was thinking we had exhausted all of the best simulator ideas. Well, Broken Arms Games is here to prove us wrong with their wine-making sim, Hundred Days, which is free on the Epic Games Store until next week.
The game is described as a "tycoon game with a narrative twist," and has three different game modes so players can personalize their wine-making experience to their preferences. For beginning players all the way up to experts, Hundred Days gives players complete control over their own winery — from which vines to grow to choosing which yeast and bacteria to add for the fermentation process to deciding on the bottling details.
Every choice you make along the way will determine the quality and quantity of wine that you end up producing, making Hundred Days the perfect choice for any prospective winery owners. There's even a couple of different DLCs you can purchase, like the Napa Valley expansion that allows players to "explore a new American wine region," and the Grape Lab expansion that allows players to "create and produce [their] favorite grape variety."

On top of the in-depth simulation mechanics, I also just love Hundred Days' art style. It's kind of cartoony and saturated with color, and I have to admit that seeing those deep purples does get me in the mood for a wine-making experience. Finally I will be able to live the glamorous Napa Valley fantasy that was instilled in me as a child after watching the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. I don't think the game allows you to play as a sexy Dennis Quaid who rides horses all day, but here's hoping that's the next expansion pack.
Hundred Days will be free to download from the Epic Games Store, along with a bundle for battle royale shooter Realm Royale Reforged, until September 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On a per-game basis
While not as high-profile as 1440p output and folder-esque Game Lists, there's a somewhat buried new PlayStation 5 feature this week that will come in handy if you're constantly digging through your trophy lists. With a newly-added toggle, it's possible to "automatically show information for all hidden trophies" for any given PS5 game.
Instead of inspecting each individual hidden trophy and pressing the Square button to show its name and criteria, you can now flip a switch for a game's entire trophy list.
As shown in my screenshot up top, you just need to head to your PS5 Trophies section and press the Options button while hovering over a game — you'll see a "Reveal All" toggle. This PS5-only feature was publicized by YouTuber Mystic (via True Trophies).
I'll definitely be using this going forward (as long as I don't forget that it exists). I've never been one to care about my overall trophy count — I try to focus on games that are already clicking with me and then pursue the Platinum if it's remotely reasonable.
It's nice that game developers can tuck spoilers away inside hidden trophy descriptions, but plenty of people are just going to want to look them up right away, even before the first playthrough is finished. As always, options like this toggle are appreciated.
Also, yeah, I started playing the PS4 version of Resident Evil. It has been sloooow going.

After setting the NieR: Automata fandom ablaze with a mysterious door, modders have made it so you too can venture beyond. The mod behind the NieR church mystery is available to download right now.
Back in July, a strange video caught on in the NieR community. One player said they had found a weird door in the Copied City section of NieR: Automata.
What stemmed from there was a few days of feverish speculation and secret-hunting, up until the folks behind it revealed all. It was not a long-hidden secret or tease for a new Drakengard. It was, actually, a mod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb_Xe1Y4m90
DevolasRevenge and the others behind the project confirmed it was completely in-game, and no editing was used. To show it off, the team confirmed it was going to release it all.
And sure enough, over on NexusMods, you can head over and download the NieR Automata Church right now.
Uploader DevolasRevenge recommends being around level 90 and removing chips like Overclock and Shock Wave. They also recommend the use of the NieR Automata Mod Helper, or NAMH, to install it.
Both NieR and far away
So while there isn't some giant secret at the end, it's at least an exciting development for NieR modders. The code's available to dig around in, and who knows? Maybe this will lead to some really cool stuff in the future. I was already floored by the use of the giant statues near the end of the video, and would love to see more like that made by the community.
Nier fans still have more to look forward to as well. The NieR: Automata anime is in production, and I've got some high hopes for that. And the Switch port of NieR: Automata is right around the corner too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beating out Blu-ray, CDs, and other platforms
The Entertainment Retailer's Association (ERA) has issued statistics charting the UK sales of all "entertainment products" for 2022 so far — and it seems that the British public cannot get enough of Nintendo Switch games, with their physical iteration being the highest-grossing media available on the high street.
Boxed Nintendo Switch titles have raked in a healthy £88.7 million (around $102m USD) in revenue since January 1, 2022, outselling PlayStation's PS4 & PS5 releases (£79.6 million) and Xbox One and Series releases (£17.8 million). Away from gaming, Switch titles even outsold other forms of physical media, including music CDs (£68.9 million), DVDs (£66.8 million), and Blu-rays (£52.1 million).

Interestingly, vinyl album sales have skyrocketed, and sit in second place with a hefty revenue count of £79.6 million. This is somewhat understandable, as much of the entertainment scene has made the shift to digital formats, whereas vinyl collectors are highly unlikely to make such a move to the digital sphere. Oh, and also, vinyl albums cost a fucking fortune.
"Vinyl’s rise and rise seems unstoppable," notes ERA CEO Kim Bayley. "For a 74-year-old analogue format to eclipse the digital-age technology of games platforms is quite extraordinary. 10 years into its long climb back to favour, the vinyl revival is most definitely here to stay."
Ironically, despite sitting on top of the pile, Nintendo Switch UK sales have actually decreased from last year, with sales down around 12% when compared to the same period in 2021. Of the aforementioned formats, only PlayStation games, Blu-ray, and vinyl saw any growth on the previous year's chart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shhh, I'm trying to clutch
There's nothing better than gaming with a group of friends, but the more people you add to a party, the more chaotic and noisy it can be. Xbox has released a feature to try and mitigate some of the extra sounds in the background, thanks to a feature called party chat noise suppression. It's supposed to specifically help remove noises like buttons clicking on a controller and breathing, in addition to other unspecified background noise.
Here's hoping it can block out the music my friends bump out loud while playing Call of Duty, but that feels like wishful thinking. This feature is coming exclusively to Xbox Series X/S consoles. Of course, you can also turn off noise suppression in the options menu by going to the guide, selecting Parties & Chats, then selecting Options, and finally untoggling noise suppression.
Xbox also says that while this feature is coming to Series X/S today, it'll be rolling out to other devices soon. We'll have to see what it turns out like in practice, but if it works well, I'm hoping PlayStation can get a similar feature soon, as it's my console of choice.

In the blog post announcing the noise suppression release, Xbox also highlighted another new feature: a button to jump right into a game from a shared capture on mobile and PC.
Basically what this means is that when you or your friends share screenshots or gameplay clips with each other via link sharing, you will now have the option to launch the game in question at just a click of a button. Thanks to cloud gaming, you'll be able to start playing the game right there in your browser as well.
The one caveat is that some games require Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for cloud gaming, but other than that this seems like a convenient addition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many coins you got left to toss?
As part of the investor call held yesterday by CD Projekt RED, the studio noted its continuing interest in its high-fantasy franchise The Witcher — Not only did the Polish developer announce that pre-production had already begun, but also suggested that the as-yet-untitled release is expected to kick off an entirely new "saga" set within the sex-and-monster-filled universe.
During the call, CDPR CEO Adam Kiciński was asked to elaborate further on his use of the word "saga" to describe the new title, which is currently in its pre-production stage. Kiciński then explains that CDPR sees the first three Witcher titles, (The Witcher, Assassins of Kings, and Wild Hunt), as presenting a single saga within Geralt's world, while the new title will be the first chapter of a whole new arc.
https://youtu.be/YXxF1HfPBoY?t=3031
It remains to be seen which lands, heroes, enemies, and narratives are set to make an appearance in the new games, but one can expect CDPR to give it their all with the new release — given the huge interest in The Witcher property following the globally successful Netflix series. In addition, CDPR will likely be looking to repolish its reputation, which took one hell of a ding in the aftermath of the Cyberpunk 2077 launch. CDPR had previously been viewed as something of a "can do no wrong" studio to many — a prestige that the developer will be looking to reclaim.
Of course, we are some years out from our return to the digital iteration of The Continent, so Witcher fans will, unfortunately, have to sit in their local tavern and Gwent it out until Geralt of Rivia (or whomever) is finally ready to draw their swords and venture into the great unknown once more.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is scheduled to launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X in 2022.

Likewise, Crystal Dynamics say they have taken "control" of its Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain games from their previous owner, Square Enix.

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genesect, Marshadow, and Volcanion
A Pokemon distribution is underway in Europe! If you're still playing Pokemon Sword and Shield (or have access to it), you can partake.
The Europe Pokemon distribution event: Genesect, Marshadow, and Volcanion at GAME (UK), Gamemania (Belgium/Netherlands)
Genesect, Marshadow, and Volcanion are all part of the same event, which is going on at the moment in several regions of Europe (listed above) until September 30. According to Pokekalos, it will be an in-store deal, and you'll get a receipt with the code for the trio. Again, this distribution is restricted to Pokemon Sword and Shield.
Once you have your code, you have until December 31 to actually put it in using the mystery gift system. There's another event possibly on the horizon, too!
Another event is on the books: a shiny Eternatus at GameStop
Details on the shiny Eternatus event are slim, but Pokebeach is reporting that GameStop stores are prepping for a GameStop distribution event (to be announced soon). While GameStop just secures a US drop right now, it could come to other regions.
Yet another event is live now
Also remember there's a code live now for Ash's Gengar! Oh, and there's going to be a Scarlet and Violet bonus distribution when it launches. Nintendo and Game Freak are getting everything out of the way before a new era begins, that's for sure.

A new ID@Xbox showcase is on the way. Xbox and Twitch are collaborating to spotlight a heaping helping of indie news on Wednesday, September 14 in the ID@Xbox Fall Showcase.
The event will air on Twitch, both through the /twitchgaming and Xbox channels.
Prior to the showcase, Black Girl Gamers will host a pre-show featuring the upcoming multiplayer deception game Eville. That will start at 9:30 a.m. PT / 12:30 p.m. ET, on the Black Girl Gamers, Twitch Gaming, and Xbox channels.
Then, the main showcase will start at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. Xbox says it's expected to run for over 90 minutes, and it will be open to co-streaming.
What's new in the world of indies
As for what to expect, ID@Xbox has already announced a few title appearing in the showcase. Metal: Hellsinger and You Suck at Parking will be in attendance, as will gameplay for the upcoming Ghostbuster: Spirits Unleashed.
There's also going to be announcements, trailers, deep dives and developer interviews. There will also probably be a fair amount of games announced as coming to Game Pass.
Traditionally, these showcases have spotlighted some pretty cool stuff. The ID@Xbox showcase this last March, for example, had Half Mermaid's Immortality, the fun escape room sim Escape Academy, and the powerbomb-RPG WrestleQuest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEStlPKIGL8
It's safe to say that something here will probably pop up and surprise someone. If you're looking at the fall games lineup and not really seeing anything that strikes your fancy, this might be worth a watch. You never know when a neat indie game might come out of nowhere and surprise you.
The ID@Xbox Fall Showcase airs on September 14, with the pre-show getting underway at 9:30 a.m. PT.

Player First Games has released the newest character for its platform brawler MultiVersus, which is currently enjoying a very, very popular open beta on PC and consoles — Climbing out of his ornate box and into your hearts, it's Gizmo, the cuddly critter from Joe Dante's 1984 classic, Gremlins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMQetKqvYYU
As we reported yesterday, Gizmo is a support class character, designed to help bolster the abilities of his in-match teammates. Gizmo's "Song of the Mogwai" sees our pal warble his cute little ditty, conjuring up music notes that can damage the opposition, while "Gizmo-a-Go-Go" sees the Mogwai cling to his partner, cleansing them of all current debuffs while hanging on for the ride. Of course, it would not be Gizmo without his iconic "Hunter's Bow", an improvised weapon utilized at the climax of movie sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch. The bow can also be charged for flaming Tippex glory.
Gizmo is available to purchase in MultiVersus today, and will be followed by further Season One characters at a later date. These will include Rick of Rick & Morty fame, DC Comics' anti-hero Black Adam, and Gizmo's arch nemesis, Stripe himself. As previously noted, dataminers have also discovered clues pertaining to further, unannounced characters, you can check out these spoilers in our previous article.
MultiVersus is available in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Electronic Arts is officially revealing its newest studio. Ridgeline Games is the Seattle-based studio led by Marcus Lehto, and it's working on a project set in the Battlefield universe.
Lehto's move to Electronic Arts was announced almost a year ago, in October. Today, we have confirmation of both the studio's name and its first project. Ridgeline Games is working on a narrative campaign, set in the Battlefield universe.
"It is a great honor to have the opportunity to collaborate with DICE and Ripple Effect and lead the charge on expanding the narrative, storytelling and character development opportunities in the Battlefield series," said Lehto in a press release.

Independent developer Vodeo Games has revealed that it will be closing its doors in the near future. The sad news was announced on Twitter just yesterday and comes less than a year after the studio's debut release, anthropomorphic adventure Beast Breaker.
"The story is unfortunately a familiar one for small studios," explained the studio. "Despite a year of avid efforts, we've been unable to secure funding for our next project from publishers and investors. As such, we've run out of funds and aren't able to keep the team together – and there is simply no Vodeo without our incredible team."

One of the best things about the Nintendo Switch is its region-free eShop. That means that you can buy or download games from any region, and play them with no issue on your console. It also means that you can access games that are region-specific, or prices and sales in one region but not another, as long as you know how.
But perhaps you've seen pricing in multiple currencies — dollars, Euro, and pounds, for example — and noticed that the prices don't seem to add up at all. It depends on the game and publisher, of course, and some of them are more or less the same across territories. Others, however, can be very different.

Splatoon 3 is king this week, as it's fully set for a September 9 debut following the Splatfest demo.

Unless you actually had the sudden urge to take up that eclectic mix of hobbies (in which case, boy do we have the game for you), it is most likely that you too were a sucker for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which proved to be a little pocket of comfort while everything else seemed very dark. Now that the world has begun to open up again, our Animal Crossing obsessions feel like a fever dream of an age gone by, but that hasn't stopped some fans from living the life that Tom Nook was so keen to sell.

Overwatch 2 is less than a month out, and today we're getting some mixed messaging about how its new heroes will roll out. It looks like Overwatch 2's heroes will unlock via the Battle Pass.
The Watchpoint Pack, the paid version of the upcoming free-to-play multiplayer portion of Overwatch 2, includes the first season's premium Battle Pass track. And a since-removed portion of that description (via Polygon) notes unlocking heroes via the Battle Pass.
Overwatch commercial leader and Blizzard VP Jon Spector addressed this on Twitter, describing it as "incomplete info posted early" about the Battle Pass. While details will be shared ahead of launch, Spector confirms that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Victory Road (Champion Rank), Herba Mystica (Path of Legends), School Troublemakers (Starfall Street)
Nintendo has finally detailed the three core Pokemon Scarlet and Violet storylines, and they'll deal with the following the classic Victory Road "I wanna be the best" journey, as well two other concepts called Path of Legends and Starfall Street. All of this is touched on in a recent trailer, but it's really broken down in a really detailed way on the official site.
Here's the gist:
"Three stories will be woven into your adventure while traversing the sprawling Paldea region. Along Victory Road, you will go to Gyms in different locations in order to achieve Champion Rank. On the Path of Legends, you can join Arven in search of rare ingredients. And in Starfall Street, you’ll challenge Team Star, a group of delinquents causing trouble for the school."

So everything is finally coming together. One core feature of this generation was the ability to tackle three storylines in any order, and now we have the full scoop on the themes and characters involved with all of them. Putting in Victory Road and a nemesis plot is a no-brainer and is kind of incorporated into every game anyway: but the third option of finding the Herba Mystica is intriguing (especially with the wrinkle of "Titan Pokemon" playing a part).
On paper, this sounds like a cool idea, especially for folks who only have time to pick the game up for moments at a time. Instead of working toward one lengthy and arduous storyline, they can attempt to finish three smaller ones. Of course, how well scaling mechanics are implemented remains to be seen.

I should have been able to resist the urge to download the game as I am not a fan of this particular offshoot of the city simulation genre.

If there ever was a genre that was perfect for Switch, it has to be roguelikes. The pick-up-and-play nature of them is perfect for getting a game in on your commute or on your work break. Another ironically great genre for a Nintendo platform is the First Person Shooter, thanks to the inclusion of gyro-aim. Mash these two together with a side helping of rhythm game and you get BPM: Bullets Per Minute; a game we were very excited to finally get on Switch. However, for as good of a fit as it is in theory, the little hybrid console that could struggles to keep up with this heavy metal hero.
BPM places you in control of one of the Valkyries of Norse mythology, as you battle through different realms such as Asgard and Helheim to defeat the Nidhogg. The catch is that everything you do in the game — from shooting, reloading, using abilities, and even jumping — must be done to the beat of the fantastic metal soundtrack. Much like the 'boomer shooters' that inspired it; BPM is tough as nails and lightning fast, requiring you to always keep moving or get sent back to Valhalla.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarök comes with a whopping 60-plus accessibility options, from auto-sprinting down muddy roads to noticeable direction indicators for combat sequences. Above all, a deeper level of customization lets players fine-tune their own wintry apocalypse. PlayStation enthusiasts might recognize the phrase “Play has no limits” from a string of ads. Ragnarök’s lead UX designer, Mila Pavlin, echoed the same sentiments and voiced her dedication to centering players of all walks of life. “This is a fantasy epic,” Pavlin says. “This is about a father and son. This is about fate and the Nine Realms. And the ability to go into that, regardless of your background, and be able to experience all this rich detail and history and story? That drives me every day.”

Vodeo Games, the developer behind the turn-based RPG Beast Breaker, has announced that it will be shutting down after failing to secure the necessary funds to keep its team together.
The announcement was made via a Twitter post yesterday evening at 7:30pm BST, with Vodeo Games stating that "despite a year of avid efforts, we've been unable to secure funding for our next project from publishers and investors" and that "there is simply no Vodeo without our incredible team". It goes on to state that the studio's final efforts will go into securing a Steam release for Beast Breaker in the hope that this will continue to support the team members as they go their separate ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to "the fat chapter", and the others all went "Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!". Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn't fit anywhere else. Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on 'em.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mostly to shore up the campaign
A Splatoon 3 day one patch is confirmed by Nintendo, as detailed on their Japanese support site. The good news? It's small!
Walking through the patch, it mostly impacts some last-minute campaign changes, also referred to as "hero mode." You can alter Cap'n Cuttlefish's appearance in-game, and utilize a photo mode "in some places" in the story. The patch also enables online play for folks to get the game ready for launch on September 9 worldwide.
Simple stuff! Thankfully it's not a massive patch that fixes crucial issues. I was able to play through the entire campaign, as well as a number of turf war, ranked, salmon run, and Tableturf Battle (the new card game) without any big problems. Ideally, this patch doesn't add any!
Splatoon 3 day one patch - Ver.1.1.0 [2022.9.8]
Hero Mode Changes
You can now change the commander's [the NPC Cap'n Cuttlefish's] appearance by pressing the A button to "investigate" the "sketchbook" inside the crater tent.
*Even if you have progressed to the previous stage, you can temporarily return to the crater by examining the catfish stuffed animal in the camp and selecting "Remember the crater".
You can now use "Shooting [Photo] Mode" in some places in Hero Mode.
Other changes
You can now use functions related to Internet communication.
*The latest update data is required to play online elements.
*Local communication is not compatible with Ver. 1.0.0. Please match the version of the update data with the person you play with.

[Thanks Rich!]

We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo's behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the new heroes coming to Overwatch 2 will not be immediately playable at launch, and that's because you'll need to unlock them on the free track of the game's battle pass. 
Overwatch commercial leader and vice president of Blizzard Jon Spector revealed this on Twitter last night following leaks and rumors that stated the new heroes would need to be unlocked in the battle pass, which is a paid premium pass that rewards players for leveling up through it akin to passes seen in Fortnite and other games. That's partly true in that yes, new heroes will need to be unlocked through the battle pass but Spector clarified on Twitter that those heroes will be on the free track of the battle pass. 
"Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we'll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass." 
Addressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we'll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.
September 8, 2022
As you can see, you won't need to pay any money to unlock the new heroes in Overwatch 2. However, it could still take some time to unlock these heroes depending on where they are on the free track. Only time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to find out because Overwatch 2 is out Oct. 4. 
In the meantime, read about how Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Overwatch will come to Xbox Game Pass and then check out why we think Overwatch 2 feels like a completely different game. Read about how cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2 after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

So do the chest's owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you'll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

While some people are still discovering new things to do in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, others are making the game do new things for them. We have reported on a number of occasions about the Inventory Slot Transfer glitch in the game and how it can be used to max out your materials or provide all the Korok Seeds (though good luck sleeping after using that method, Hestu knows your secret).
The popular glitch has come up gold once again this week as the YouTube channel Gaming Reinvented has discovered yet another use for this fiddly alteration. This time, instead of simply maxing out your materials to the usual highest quantity of 999, this method (involving a trip to our beloved Eventide Island) lets you bulk up your quiver to hold 10,000 of each arrow.

It's no controversial statement to say that Activision's shooter franchise Call of Duty is something of a golden goose within the gaming industry, having raked in billions of dollars worth of revenue over the course of the past two decades. As such, the military shooter franchise currently finds itself at the center of an increasingly bitter feud between Sony PlayStation and Xbox over the brand's uncertain future.
While Microsoft's purchase of Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard is yet to be approved and completed, PlayStation is already getting antsy about whether the cash cow is getting set to become an Xbox exclusive. Despite Xbox boss Phil Spencer previously stating that PlayStation fans can expect to play Call of Duty titles "for many years" post buyout even goin…]]></summary>

Disney Dreamlight Valley proved to be a bit of a surprise at launch, and we found it to be a charming, heartfelt take on the life sim genre in our review. However, we noticed that the game wasn't well optimised for Switch, and since launch, others have reported multiple bugs with this version of the game.
Gameloft, the developer behind this Disney take on Animal Crossing, has been taking note thankfully. Over the past few days on Twitter, the studio has been detailing bugs that have been pointed out as well as some fixes that it has made since the game's release earlier this week. There are a few more tweaks to come, too (thanks, GoNintendo!).

They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow.

This week marks the release of Splatoon 3 on the Nintendo Switch. So far there's been our own Nintendo Life review, as a well as a round-up of impressions, and now we've got technical analysis from John Linneman of Digital Foundry. So, how does the third game hold up on Switch?
Jumping right into it - the game uses dynamic resolution scaling and AMD's fidelity effects FSR 1.0, and typically runs at 1920 x 1080 in docked, with it dropping to around 820p at its lowest. In portable mode, it maxes out at 720p with DRS dropping to about 75% of that.

Since the original Splatoon game, amiibo functionality has been supported. This feature returns in Splatoon 3, so what kind of unlocks can amiibo collector's expect?
Destructoid has put together a list of all the unlocks. To activate your amiibo in Splatoon 3, you'll need to find the amiibo stand in Splatsville. From there you scan your amiibo on your Switch controller, the amiibo will appear in game and you'll receive an unlock. If you haven't registered the amiibo yet, you'll also need to go through that process.

As the name suggests, it was about being a kid on summer vacation, and its slow pace and cruisy setting made it something of a cult classic, though one that sadly never saw an official English-language release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Id Software is making sure you can play the classics
Yes, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is getting some new servers in the year 2022. As more players are hopping on thanks to its free availability, id Software has deployed dedicated servers with a classic ruleset for players to run.
Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory was made available on Steam earlier this year, as part of the Bethesda launcher going away. And it's also free on the Microsoft Store, too.
With the new platform and popularity likely comes players wanting to either experience the game properly, or rekindle their old memories. And so id Software has announced that it's deployed some official dedicated servers for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, to facilitate all the nostalgic carnage.

These servers are running the vanilla Enemy Territory Campaign ruleset, with all six original maps and no mods. While id says there are servers with a variety of mods and custom maps that it highly recommends, some folks want to play the classics.
The classic, vanilla dedicated servers are set up across multiple regions, so players around the world can hop in. Four official servers have been deployed: Texas, the Netherlands, Canberra, and London.
All servers will even have a message of the day, saying the following:
"Official & Vanilla Servers hosted by id Software. Enjoy! These servers are unmoderated. For issues, help.bethesda.net"

Back to the past
It's really cool to see id Software supporting renewed interest in an older game like this. Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory was a bit of an outlier, from what I remember of its launch. Its class system and in-match experience might not seem strange now, but it was a cool take when it launched in 2003.
Now players have an easy way to dive in and play it just like it was back then.

That's a reasonable price for even one of these games, let alone the 18 games included in this bundle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No more Deltarune until 2023
As a veteran of internet culture and creative, interactive storytelling, Toby Fox has been revered for years now as the creator modern classic game Undertale, as well as his newest game Deltarune. The first two chapters of Deltarune were released back in October 2018 and February 2019 respectively, so it's been quite a while since fans have seen an update on the game. This week, however, Fox took to Twitter to provide a much-needed Deltarune update.
"We don't be able to put out any new chapters of DELTARUNE this year," Fox said. Well, at least he's straightforward. Then he teases "something special" coming up to celebrate the anniversary of Undertale and Deltarune Chapter 2, so there's something coming relatively soon.
We'll just have to hold out a bit longer. For what it's worth, you can't really blame Fox for taking his time considering he's pretty much the only one who works on these games. Making a game at all is an impressive enough feat, let alone doing all the coding, art, music, and so on completely by yourself.
https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1566962055470784519
In the meantime, though you can get your next fix of Undertale at an awesome pop-up event — so long as you live in Southern California, anyway.
From September 15 through October 10, Requiem Café in Anaheim will be hosting an event in honor of Undertale's seventh anniversary, which includes special themed food and drink items like colorful macarons and milk tea, as well as exclusive merchandise like shirts, mugs, tote bags, and more. The café is not taking any reservations for the event, but walk-ins are of course welcome.
If nothing else, a delicious peach tea with strawberry and spicy mango and some chocolate blood orange donuts will be enough to get me by. Make sure to check out the menu, because it all looks amazing.

As hardware continues to improve, it’s cool to see how we can innovate on using the physical components we interact with to further immerse us in a game’s world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brew, barter, and bewitch your way out of debt
Potionomics is getting ready to open up shop. The shop management sim from developer Voracious Games and XSEED hits PC via Steam on October 17.
In the fantasy world of Potionomics, the story follows Sylvia, an eager upstart who has taken over a potion shop after her uncle has disappeared. Despite very little knowledge in the way of potion making and selling, Sylvia has to keep the shop afloat amid stiff competition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6YDmnRZMYY
The loop of Potionomics runs through a few different genres. There's the store management aspect, where Sylvia can put out new products and upgrade the store to better serve customers. Then there's brewing potions, and trying to keep up with needs.
Once a customer wants to buy something, it turns into a card-based duel where Sylvia's ability to haggle turns into a Slay the Spire-style encounter. And there are social links with the townsfolk, which given one moment in the trailer, could possibly bloom into romance.

A pinch of this, a sprinkle of that
Potionomics has a lot going on, but in the demo I played at PAX East, it really managed it all well. Every system fed into the other, and the feeling of setting potions to brew, opening shop, haggling for profit, and conversing with others felt smooth.
It's why Voracious Games' store management sim has been on my radar since PAX. And luckily, the wait's not long now for the final game. Though the regular game will be on Steam for $24.99, XSEED is also releasing a Deluxe Edition that will have a digital artbook and soundtrack for $39.99. And sorry, no haggling those down, aside from a brief launch window discount.

A demo is also on the way for the upcoming Steam Next Fest, so players can check it out before release. Either way, I'm ready to brew some potions and move some merchandise.

The City of Lights, a place celebrated for its art, invention, culture, and architecture now resembles The Gates of Hell, a vision soon to be crafted by Rodin himself. The streets are awash with blood and bodies — innocent civilians, rebellious conspirators, and even the king's own army lying in miserable piles of broken flesh.
And the king himself? This citywide massacre is his doing, the heart of his capital torn in two by a seemingly unstoppable army of robotic soldiers. Far from being the loyal guardians and entertainers of Paris, as initially designed, the automaton army has instead become her oppressor, stal…]]></summary>

Now, of course, regulators like the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority and the U.S.’ FTC must approve of this, and those investigations are ongoing. But suppose all goes according to Microsoft’s plan. In that case, the company will own Activision Blizzard, the publisher and developer behind Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more, by the spring or summer of 2023. 
Shortly after the company announced its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed his company’s intent “to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation” following the purchase. He reaffirmed this commitment earlie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. 
GrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. 
OnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. 


Fans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment. Are you excited to replay GrimGrimoire? Will this be your first time giving it a try? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

The PlayStation Store has been cluttered with extremely bizarre and lackluster games for a while now. However, what was bad just seems to be getting worse. A handful of indie developers are gaming the system by re-releasing essentially the same game over and over — offering a new Platinum trophy with every “game.” These titles provide nothing of value and only seem to dampen everything around them.
Games like The Jumping Fries, The Jumping Fries Turbo, and dozens more like it are crowding the PSN storefront, making it harder for customers to find what they want. Not only that but actual hardworking indie devs are being lost in the shuffle of these crappy titles, forcefully pushed down the list of New Releases, which is PSN’s only real visibility too…]]></summary>

Following up on that, Polygon received comment from CD Projekt Red's global PR director Radek Grabowski. He confirms that Phantom Liberty is "the only planned expansion" for Cyberpunk 2077, and there are "no plans for more expansions beyond that."

Xbox is adding a new variant to its line of Elite Series 2 controllers. For those looking for something a bit more straightforward and a little cheaper, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller is on its way.
The Elite Series 2 has been popular, alongside its predecessor. But at $179.99 MSRP, it is also a bit hefty in the price tag. That's where the Core comes in.
The new Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller has the "essential" components of an Elite Series 2, with fewer bells and whistles. There's still adjustable tension on the thumbsticks, a rubberized grip, and hair trigger locks. Button remapping is also fully available through the Xbox Accessories app. And it comes in at $129.99 MSRP, a full $50 cheaper.

A new Sonic Frontiers song has appeared, this time it's one of Sega's signature vocal-heavy Sonic songs. From the Japanese rock band ONE OK ROCK, it's titled "Vandalize," and will serve as the ending theme of the game.
Here's what ONE OK ROCK's lead vocalist (Takahiro Moriuchi, also known as "Taka") had to say about the collaboration:
"We partnered with Sega on Sonic Frontiers because we relate to Sonic and how he’s taken on the world after getting his start in Japan. We are based in the US and have performed in Europe, Asia and South America, so we are extremely happy to be able to work with the world-renowned Sonic.”

You can watch the preview clip below via Sega with in-game footage, or listen to the song directly through the band's YouTube channel. The timing is perfect for ONE OK ROCK, as they're currently touring the US right now, and their new album is out on Friday.
I'm in it! This is one of the cleaner, best-foot-forward showings of the Sonic Frontiers marketing campaign so far. If they led with this and the Cyber Space footage, I think the reaction would have been completely different.

Tencent will invest €300 million ($297 million USD) into GBL, for a huge 49.7% share in the family business. In addition, Tencent will give GBL a long-term loan in order to purchase more stake in Ubisoft.

That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn't make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

Since its debut in 2015, the Splatoon series has delivered unique, colorful gameplay cribbed by scarce launch content and disappointing time restrictions for specific modes. While post-launch content greatly bolstered both games to this point, I’ve always been disappointed by how little was initially on offer. Now on its third entry, the series may feel a bit less fresh, but Splatoon 3 remedies the series’ long-standing launch content woes while retaining all the fun that made the series such a success.

In it, we're whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You're Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband's new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It's a bit too easy, in fact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation told players in 2020 that it could add 1440p support for game resolution output to PlayStation 5 “if requested enough.” It seems that happened because it’s now available in a new update. 
With the launch of today’s new global PS5 system software update, not only is 1440p resolution available for applicable TVs and monitors, but Gamelists and other anticipated social features are too. There’s also a new audio comparison option to listen to the difference between stereo output and 3D audio in headsets and a new YouTube voice command preview. 
“The update includes several highly-requested features like 1440p HDMI video output and gamelists, as well as social features like the ability to request a Share Screen from a fellow party member, easily view new friends’ profiles, and receive a notification to help you join a friend’s game more quickly from a party chat,” platform experience senior vice president Hideaki Nishino writes in a new PlayStation blog post. “Additionally, you can now compare 3D audio and stereo audio on the same screen and more easily access in-progress Activities from game hubs.” 
For more information about these new features, head to this breakdown here. 
This system software update will allow players in the U.S. and U.K. to preview the ability to search YouTube through voice command. 
“Another feature we’re excited to bring to more PS5 players is the ability to search for content on YouTube through Voice Command (Preview),” the blog reads. “From anywhere on PS5, including during gameplay, you can say ‘Hey PlayStation, find [keyword] on YouTube.’ The YouTube app will open, and relevant search results will be shown.”

With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It's a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it's down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we've ever seen on this model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the first wave of RTX 3080 reviews, when we had no idea of the graphics card supply shortage to come, I remember being really impressed by the Asus Tuf Gaming model. It didn't look particularly special on the outside, but it consistently beat even more expensive models in terms of thermals and performance. I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work. Now though, you can get the upgraded version of that high-performer at a more reasonable price: £650 for the Tuf Gaming OC V2, an overclocked model offering excellent performance for £400 below this model's UK RRP.

This fall, you can outfit your PS5 with gray camouflage plates, a DualSense controller, or Pulse 3D headset. While it's as camo as camo can be, eagle-eyed fans can spot tiny PlayStation symbols embedded into the lightest shades of the pattern for a nice touch. 


Pre-orders begin on September 15. The cover plates and DualSense launch globally on October 14. The headset becomes available in December. Sony has not listed prices for these items. 
Maybe one day we'll get a camo version of the recently revealed DualSense Edge controller. In related news, Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. territories. It also acquired Savage Games Studios as part of its newly formed mobile division.]]></summary>

I say it's a trailer that's kind of new because if you've been keeping up with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, there's a good chance you've already seen it. It's the NSFW one released last week, but it featured Japanese VO with subtitles. Today, CDPR has released the same trailer with the English dub now.

Winding footpaths led to expansive hubs at a scale unlike previous games in the franchise.

Golden path locales like Midgard and its massive Lake of the Nine, Alfheim, home to light and dark elves, Helheim, the underworld, and Jötunheim, the land of Giants, were sprawling zones in their own right, filled with enough content to keep players engaged. Yet, the optional but equally impressive Niflheim and Muspelheim realms pushed player skills to the limit with vigorous combat trials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has revealed that it will drop a brand new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer tomorrow, Sept. 7. This news comes from a tweet made today on the official Pokémon Twitter account, and while it says the trailer drops tomorrow at 6 a.m. PT/ 9 a.m. ET, it doesn't reveal anything else. Check it out for yourself below:
🚨 A new #PokemonScarletViolet trailer drops tomorrow! 🚨
https://t.co/8Hw4hsHzDJ pic.twitter.com/1e0WKO8bxh
September 6, 2022
So as for what to expect, your guess is as good as anyone else's. I wager we'll be seeing some new Pokémon, perhaps some more information about the legendaries and how they play into the wider narrative of this gen, and maybe a new look at some gym leaders. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long. 
In the meantime, watch the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer for a quick look at this gen's competitive play, and then catch up on everything we learned from the recent Pokémon Presents livestream. 
What's the one thing you really hope to see during tomorrow's trailer? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell. Let's admire its gleaming reveal trailer below.

Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It's ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it's invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there's a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

Gearbox Software's upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won't have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games' Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

After watching yesterday's TF2 panel, we were incredibly excited to put our own questions to the TF2 squad. Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes.

 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang's blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we've seen here at PAX so far.
If you've not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game's trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game's development. Watch it below:

We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island's world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game's story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won't wanna miss that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

This time though, you'll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a busy day at PAX West, but nothing has been as wild as the Gearbox Software panel. Randy Pitchford made a return to the Seattle stage to let us know what's coming up for Gearbox, but not without some shenanigans first.
After a classic Randy magic trick, a proud display of lock-down Lego builds, and a chaotic bidding war where he auctioned off the literal shirt off his back (which an audience member bought for an eye-watering $1200) we finally got to see some fresh New Tales From The Borderlands gameplay and had a lovely chat with director of production, James Lopez. Watch the video below for the interview in its entirety - it's a good'un!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher 2K teased back in April that it was bringing back Telltale’s Tales from the Borderlands series but that this time, it would be developed in-house by Gearbox Software. Then, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event, Gearbox officially revealed the sequel, which is less a direct continuation of Telltale’s story and more a spiritual successor to the series, which is evident in its official name: New Tales from the Borderlands. 
That new trailer gave us a look at the new protagonists – altruistic scientist Anu, her street-wise brother Octavio, and local business owner Fran – as well as a look at just how Tales from the Borderlands this new entry is this time around. Sure, it’s a new cast and an all-new story in the world of Borderlands, but it’s clear it will play and feel familiar…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-02T22:16:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Splitgate, the sci-fi multiplayer shooter with portals, received some bittersweet news today. Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.
1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. 
As such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. 
You can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):
Splitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game's early missions, I can genuinely say that I'd be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I'd genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh my goodness, what a creepy, funny, and odd game Northern Journey is. I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey "retro" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.

Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be "about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what's next for Cyberpunk 2077."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

        <updated>2022-09-02T12:20:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: 

For more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that.

Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don't have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

Today I'd like to suggest adding Skybox Satellite, a Twitter account which shows glimpses of the skies wrapped around maps in GoldSrc games like Half-Life and Counter-Strike. It's sometimes pretty, sometimes nostalgic, and sometimes impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real and we'll be learning more about it next week.
That's because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we'll learn more about the future of Assassin's Creed and more. It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. 
Assassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.

September 1, 2022
If rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer.

Online Campaign Co-Op
The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

So, at this year's Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios' chief technology officer Mark James about what I'd seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest.

Endnight Games' post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team's hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio's most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.


At the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as "Project Code Name 'M'" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were high expectations going into Buried Memory, patch 6.2 for Final Fantasy XIV - new raids, new story, and, most importantly, a new mode called Island Sanctuary to fulfil all of your farming dreams. There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.


Meant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.

You now have until October 1st to cram in some multiplayer for several early Assassin’s Creeds, the original version of Far Cry 3, Driver: San Francisco and others. Ubisoft say they’ve been “exploring what is possible to reduce disruption” over the last month, hence the shuffled date for decommissioning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this segment of New Gameplay Today, your host, Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc, walks you through how Saturnalia works as both a survival horror game and a roguelike. In it, you'll see him control Anita, one of the game's many playable characters, as she searches for her partner in the small town of Sardinia, Italy.
Unfortunately for Anita, it's not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening. That translates to a terrifying creature that stalks Anita and others through the darkness of the night and you must avoid it all while remaining alive as you search for clues to end this night of terror and misery. 
In the New Gameplay Today segment below, we have more than 15 minutes of brand-new Saturnalia footage to showcase. Enjoy!


Saturnalia is being developed and published by Santa Ragione. It's due out on PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime this year. For more, check out the Saturnalia reveal trailer.]]></summary>

Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I'm unsure whether it'll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. "I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past," he tells me. "This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017." And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could've hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don't think that's true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy's The Road, No Country F…]]></summary>

This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%.

The series’ current direction is inspired by an old studio motto: Playing with your food.
“That’s an internal philosophy that we’ve had since back in the day,” Sheth says. “Kratos plays with his food. We tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, ‘We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.’ That’s been the guiding principle more than anything else.”

In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  
I spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams as well as some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your shovels ready because Shovel Knight Dig will burrow its way onto Switch, PC, and iOS via Apple Arcade next month. 
More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What's more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It'll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


"When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight's peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them," a press release reads. "But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist."
"Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure." 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gungrave G.O.R.E. marks the return of the Gungrave franchise after almost 20 years (well, besides that VR game), and today we found out that the sequel is coming just in time for Thanksgiving. A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mafia celebrates its 20th anniversary today, and in a new blog post by Hanger 13, the principal minds behind the series reflect on its creation and history while also teasing what’s next.
Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
