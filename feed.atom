        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I didn't plan to say it, but I'm going to say it anyway".
There have been a lot of comparisons this year suggesting the PlayStation hit Astro Bot is more like a Super Mario or Nintendo game than a Sony one. With this in mind, it seems the game's director Nicolas Doucet might have finally put all of this debate to rest.
In a surprising moment during the 'Game of the Year' segment at this year's Game Awards, he took a moment to pay tribute to a few key inspirations...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the final reveal of the night for The Game Awards 2024, developer Naughty Dog revealed its next game to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, and is currently in development for PlayStation. According to studio head Neil Druckmann, the studio's new IP has been in development since 2020.




In the roughly four-and-a-half-minute trailer, the main character Jordan, played by Tati Gabrielle (also Nora in The Last of Us show), appears to be a bounty hunter lying low in deep space. According to the announcement post for Intergalactic on Naughty Dog's website, Jordan is stranded on Sempiria, a planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. It's up to Jordan to use her skills and wits to be the first person in over 600 years to leave the planet's orbit.


The teaser looks solid enough, though obviously I have many questions. After all, Naughty Dog is known for its ability to craft incredible stories, so that's what I'm interested in learning more about. However, The Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley revealed after the trailer that legendary composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross will be scoring Intergalactic which has me pumped.


These types of reveals typically intend to drum up interest in preparation for bigger reveals later down the line, and in this case, it has served that purpose. Show me more, Naughty Dog!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Geoff Keighley got really emotional for some reason before using an orchestra to reveal that an Okami sequel is on its way. (Hopefully) tentatively titled Okami Sequel, it will be helmed by Hideki Kamiya. That's all we know.


It's still an interesting announcement, since Kamiya left Capcom in 2006 with the closure of Clover Studios. In fact, Keighley did mention Clover, so I don't know what that means.




We last saw Okami with 2010's Okamiden, which released on DS after the closure of Clover. The original game is rather celebrated and continues to see re-releases, so it getting a sequel is a little less surprising than Kamiya working with Capcom again. Regardless, we don't know anything about it. It's barely a teaser. We didn't even get a name, and showing it as "Okami Sequel" is super awkward. But there you have it.


Okami Sequel has announced targeted platforms or release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 showcased a new trailer at The Game Awards 2024, and there are plenty of reasons for the fans to be excited.


Of course, a lot of important information is yet to be revealed, including the final release date. But there were some important moments in the trailer, including what could be a new movement mechanic. Fans can wishlist the game as of writing, and it could be the start of a new chapter altogether for the franchise.


Borderlands 4 could be a direct sequel to Borderlands 3


For all things better and worse, Borderlands 3 has largely been a mixed affair for the fans. With Borderlands 4, Gearbox has chosen to make the most ambitious project of all time. The official first-look title might not have given us a launch date, but it looks like the good old Pandora that we know.


Players are likely going to have the option to choose between different characters, just like in Borderlands 3. There was a specific scene in the trailer that highlighted the presence of guns of different rarities, which has always been a strong point of the franchise.




Outside that, fans will have to wait till there's an official release date. The game is going to be available for PC and consoles, and it appears (based on now) that old-gen will not be getting the new game. We also know that the release will happen in 2025, and an exact date is likely going to be announced soon by Gearbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At The Game Awards 2024, Ryu Ga Gotoku has given a look at Project Century, which seems to be a rather over-the-top period piece. I know what you're thinking, but it looks pretty distinct from the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, even if it seems to be in the same genre.


There's not a whole lot to go on in the trailer. It takes place in 1915 in what looks like Tokyo. However, it's heavily industrialized and seems to have a lot more Western influence, implying an alternate history. The plot isn't really outlined, but you seem to play as a thug (typical Ryu ga Gotoku). Combat seems a bit faster, more chaotic, and more violent than your typical Like a Dragon, which was already pretty brutal.




Not much else to go on aside from that. However, what has been shown has piqued my interest.


Ryu ga Gotoku hasn't announced target platforms or a release date, and it's unlikely that Project Century will be the final name. Story is still developing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outer Worlds 2 has been revealed at The Game Awards 2024, and it will be coming sooner than expected. 


Developers Obsidian Entertainment has revealed important information surrounding their upcoming title, including a potential hint towards the release date. Being an Xbox Games studio, there's extra good news for the those who are subscribed to the Game Pass. 


The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay footage looks quite promising


It appears that 2025 will be a busy year for Obsidian, and Avowed might not be the only big release. The Outer Worlds 2 is also going to release next year, although a specific date is yet to be announced. That said, it's going to be a day one addition to the Xbox Game Pass on both PC and consoles. 


Talking of platform, the sequel is going to be available on the PlayStation at launch. This will be great news for those who are exclusively tied to Sony's console, and they won't be missing out on any of the action. 


The central theme, once again, appears to be pretty similar to the first title. Players will be going back to the future, with the aim of "not messing it up" once again. It will be interesting to see if Obsidian might be able to take the IP to the next step with their upcoming project, and when they give out an exact release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer genDESIGN, the creators of critically acclaimed titles Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian, have revealed their next title. Even though there's not even a title yet, the brief teaser trailer certainly gives the classic world-building vibes the creators are known for.




The game will be published by Epic Games Publishing, and will be available on the Epic Games Store, PlayStation, and Xbox. The Tokyo-based team is led by game director Fumito Ueda.


Not much was revealed about the game, but in the teaser, we see a character climbing up a mech as a countdown voice commands to evacuate all areas within a 25km radius of ground zero, followed by a 60-second countdown. As the player reaches the cockpit of the mech, an apocalyptic wave of destruction rumbles in the distance headed toward the player who evacuates the mech from a pod in its head at the last second.


Even though it was brief, the world already has me interested. And it's hard to argue, the climbing up the mech certainly gave me nostalgia for climbing up the colossal beasts of Shadow of the Colossus. Looking forward to learning more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Saga's global launch, which happened a couple of weeks ago, has introduced the new gacha to mobiles and PC. 


It's a free-to-play title that can be played on your handheld, or you could choose to download it via PC. Like every good gacha, there's a tier list of all the characters currently available inside the game. This tier list will help you to sort out your early team, and invest the resources efficiently. 


Gran Saga tier list


I have kept three tiers to classify the characters. In Gran Saga, you can potentially use any character currently available to build your team. 



S-tier: Strong characters who should be future-proof for the power curve. 


A-tier: Decent characters who can be as good as S-tier in certain situations. 


B-tier: Good characters who will need a lot of time and investment to reach the late-game stages. 



In Gran Saga, characters also have their own elemental type, and it's important to make a squad well-balanced in general to cover the strengths and weaknesses.

While it's still early days, I would prefer to build a team with a single type of damage. In simpler words, it's better to go for either a full-magic team, or a full-physical. It's not easy as you won't have the top-tier names from both types immediately after starting the game. That said, the pulls have so far been pretty generous, so making a top team won't be a difficult ask at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards 2024 opened with the first world premiere of The Witcher 4, and it will mark the return of a familiar face in a new avatar.


The new project has already been in work since CD Projekt Red announced it previously, but we now have more details about what to expect. While it will be a new saga entirely, the game is going to be called The Witcher 4. From the looks of the trailer itself, it will be a direct sequel to the main of the first trilogy, and players will be able to play as none other than Ciri.


Ciri officially takes over from Geralt in The Witcher 4


There has been plenty of speculation about what to expect from the new Witcher game. The Game Awards 2024 show has shed the first light, and Ciri will be the main character in the new title. Of course, she has followed in the footsteps of Geralt, and she's now a Witcher herself.


The render, which wasn't gameplay footage in a direct sense, gave the audience a glimpse at some of the potential dangers that Ciri will be facing. The opening footage had her facing a fierce monster to save a village girl from being slaughtered. 




It's the first glimpse of the lore that's going to be present in the upcoming project. So far, Ciri remains the only familiar face on the reveal, but it's safe to expect for known faces from The Witcher universe. Incidentally, there was a hint towards the end of the trailer, which could be a proof of Geralt playing some sort of a role. For more, fans will have to wait, and a release date is yet to be announced.


It will be interesting to find out more details about the story and if it will be a direct continuation of the events that took place in The Witcher 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of The Game Awards 2024, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced a new Standalone entry in the Elden Ring series, Elden Ring: Nightreign. It's set to arrive in 2025.


It will look familiar to anyone who played the original game, but is being described as a "standalone co-op action survival game." Apparently, players need to "outlast a three day-and-night cycle" on a changing map. It's set in a universe parallel to the events of Elden Ring. You choose from one of eight players. At the end of each night, you face off against a boss.




I'm not big into multiplayer, and I prefer to make my own character in these games, but from the information, this seems cool. It does say you can play solo, if you dare. Otherwise, the framework sounds kind of unique, not necessarily round-based, but short enough to pick up and play.


Elden Ring: Nightreign will arrive sometime in 2025 for PC, Xbox, and PC.

It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not every sea creature is going to be easy to add to your Bestiary in Fisch, the fishing simulator on Roblox. One such fish is the Helicoprion, a prehistoric shark famous for its spiral-shaped jaw with razor-sharp teeth. This great beast can be tough to get a hold of, so if you’re struggling, we’re here to help you out.


Where to find Helicoprion in Fisch


The Helicoprion shark can only be found at the Ancient Isle, far east. This island is full of prehistoric fish, including other famous sea creatures like the Mosasaurus and the Megalodon.


It’s no cakewalk to get to, either, as whirlpools and other hazards surround the island. Take it slow. Once you’ve reached it, I recommend heading to the waterfall for the best chance to catch a Helicoprion, casting your bait nearby.

The Helicoprion prefers Squid for bait, which you can get from Bait Crates, Common Crates, and Quality Bait Crates. While you can catch this prehistoric shark during any season and any time of day, they do prefer clear weather.


Once you’ve caught one on your lure, a pink exclamation point will appear about your avatar’s head. The Helicoprion shark will move around very erratically, so you’ll need to pay close attention to the fishing bar. You’ll also be hit with a significant progress speed decrease of 70%.


However, so long as you pay attention to the bar, you’ll be able to catch the Helicoprion without too much trouble. The biggest challenge comes from actually hooking one, it being a Mythical fish and all that. However, once you do catch it, you’ll get a sweet 2,500 XP as a reward. Not too shabby. Plus, it’s a great fish to show off to your friends to make them jealous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Roblox fishing simulator, Fisch, features common cods you can find just about anywhere, and mythical sea creatures that take tenacity and patience to find. In fact, there’s a fish so rare it was thought to be extinct: The Whisker Bill. Here's how you can find and catch it.


Where to find the Whisker Bill in Fisch


The Whisker Bill can only be found on the island of Moosewood, either at the docks or at the back of the island. The best spot to find it is at the small island you can reach by boat behind Moosewood itself. It has a few trees and a cliff. You can easily hop on any boat and make your way over to begin fishing in the area. You can see it directly from the docks on the back of the island. I’d recommend standing on the corner of the island facing the main part of Moosewood as this area has the highest spawn rate for the Whisker Bill.

How to get the Whisker Bill in Fisch


You’ll want a Truffle Worm to lure the Whisker Bill in, which you can find inside Coral Geodes, Volcanic Geodes, or Treasure Chests. Coral Geodes only cost 600 C$ from the shop, so I’d recommend these. If you complete 50 or more Angler quests, you’ll also get a Truffle Worm for your trouble. 


Once you’ve got the bait and are at the right spot, cast your lure into the water. The Whisker Bill doesn’t have any preference for time of day, season, or weather, but it is a Mythical-class rarity fish, so it won't be easy to find. When you’ve got one on your lure, a pink exclamation point will pop up, indicating that you’re luring a Mythical fish.


The Whisker Bill moves around the fishing bar a lot, and you’ll take a 20% progress speed decrease when trying to catch it. This won’t be too noticeable unless you have a very fast rod, but you can still tell.


Whether you’re looking to complete your Bestiary or just want to show off to your friends, the Whisker Bill is a great fish and gives you a nice 150 XP when you catch it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to huge multiplayer releases like Marvel Rivals, the question is whether the game is cross-play or cross-platform. In many cases, it does, but in instances like this, the answer will vary.


Does Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?


Unfortunately, Marvel Rivals does not have or support cross-progression. If you were hoping to play on PC and switch over to consoles like Xbox or PS5, you wouldn’t be able to carry progression over, including skins and unlocks. 


This does mean that all purchases will have to be made again if you play between platforms. All earned currencies like Units, Lattice, and Chrono Tokens will have to be earned or purchased again too.


Does Marvel Rivals have crossplay?


Luckily, if you want to at least play with friends on other matchmaking pools, you can do that. There are some restrictions, though.


If you have a group that wants to play together, then Quick Play, Conquest, Custom Games, and Practice modes will be the only things you can play. Ranked and Competitive modes will be restricted.

What to do if you have multiple platforms to play on


If you want to partake in activities like ranked, especially with friends, you will have to all coordinate playing on the same matchmaking realm.


For example, PC players can only play with PC, and console players can only play between Xbox and PlayStation. Due to mechanics like aim assist on consoles and PC players being able to turn quicker, these two matchmaking pools have to be separate. 


The last hurdle in matching together on the same Competitive matchmaking pool is that you need to ensure you’re level 10 to play in these playlists. Otherwise, you’ll only have Quickplay. 


And if quickplay is the case, you’re better off sticking to your primary platform for the foreseeable future so you won’t miss out on account and Battle Pass progression.

The Dumbo Octopus can only be caught at Roslit Bay. While there is no specific spot that is guaranteed to have more Dumbo Octopi than others, I’d recommend heading to the coral reef by the bay on the island.

Cast On Gems are Meta Gems that allow you to utilize a Cause and Effect clause to cast spells without needing to use them on your skill bar.

How to clean trash or throw something out in Brick Life


You may have trouble finding litter when you begin the 'Clean Trash or Throw Something Out' task in Brick Life. I ran into this issue initially, especially since waste will be pretty hidden. The main thing you need to look for is trash cans that have a bag on top of it. Or, you can pick up litter from Watch-O-Plex. Trash can locations will be randomized, but I've had the most luck finding them near Durr Burger. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


The Durr Burger Line Cook job features a trash-based mission, which is likely why the litter frequently appears there. You can try other locations to see if waste pops up. However, remember that trash cans without bags have already been cleaned, so there's no need to interact with them. Another superb area to check out is Watch-O-Plex, where the theater room always has trash on the ground. 


If you haven't found a suitable trash can, you can choose the second option: throwing something out. Grab anything you don't need, like a piece of paper or a ticket. You can collect plenty of items around town, making this objective much more manageable. Then, approach any trash area to throw it out.

Upon successfully completing the Clean Trash task in Brick Life, you'll be rewarded with 500 cash in your pocket. This is just one of the many ways to earn money in the game, besides the ATM and job objectives. Use your hard-earned cash to upgrade your home lots or get a Hoverboard.

How to get a Sack o' Cash in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


LEGO Fortnite Brick Life offers two main ways to get sacks of cash, known in-game as a sack o' cash:



Take a sack from the ATMs outside of Vaulted Value Propositions.


Break into Vaulted Value Propositions' vault and claim it from the money cart.



Both options require getting into the Vaulted Value Propositions bank and taking the sack of cash alongside some money. The first option gives you 50 coins and the sack, while the vault version grants you 500 cash, making it a b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't speak for everyone, of course, but when I play Skyrim, I seldom stop to admire the wildlife that frolics throughout this cold slice of Tamriel anymore. I think I've just played the game so much that I've gradually become numb to any visual allure. But with the power of modding, I can learn to truly appreciate TES5 once more.


Thanks to Nexus Mods user shadowman2777, I can now sleep with a cow. No, no. Not like that. Please try to focus here. I mean, "Sleep With Any Cow Shout" is a way of chilling with a fellow bovine creature while out and about in Skyrim.


Image via shadowman2777 / Nexus Mods.


If you just want to kick back with a furry wild beast (again, drag your mind out of the gutter), you can employ this custom Shout, which will allow you to cuddle up to any cow you target. Why would you want to do this? Why are you being so judgmental, is my rebuttal.


Fus-Cow-Dah!


Seriously, look how chilled out the guy in the image above looks, craning his neck to feel rested against the animal's stomach. Ignore the well-endowed woman in the neon pink cocktail dress who's standing nearby. I'm sure she's not related to the mod.


Oh, there is one thing I should probably say. While, yes, there are cows in Skyrim, they don't appear like the ones in the images shared by shadowman2777 on Nexus. This is because – according to the description – this mod seems to require another download: "FNIS Creatures." I'm not sure if this is for the animations or these particular types of cows. In any case, if you need it, you can download if from here.


By now, you should all have enough Skyrim mods installed to make the aging RPG look like a different game entirely. No, but seriously, if Bethesda doesn't let us mod The Elder Scrolls 6 by improving the visuals, adding custom quests, or changing the names of the Frost Trolls to Tim Allen for some reason, what even is the point?

But Ybarra pointed to Marvel’s Black Widow and her similarities to Overwatch 2’s Widowmaker. Gamers have been quick to point out that Black Widow first featured in Marvel comics more than 50 years ago, while even her appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe predates the original Overwatch’s launch by more than five years. Other critics have also likened aspects of the latest Marvel title with that of Blizzard’s hero shooter.

When Victory Heat Rally first appeared on Kickstarter back in 2020, the game appeared set to pay homage to Sega's wonderful Super Scaler range of arcade games from the 1980s. In the four years that have followed between that Kickstarter launch and this Switch release, something appears to have been lost along the way.
Rather than the Kickstarter trailer’s segmented rollercoaster-like tracks, which immediately conjured up memories of Seger's brilliant arcade racer Power Drift, instead the tracks in Victory Heat Rally look a lot more like the typical 3D environments expected from a modern racing game, albeit with cel shading designed to deliberately make them look more basic.

(That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

        <updated>2024-12-12T15:53:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.

I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

        <updated>2024-12-12T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book ("The goal is to do everything, right?"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Space Marine 2's wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends "inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is it with you hero types? Always the same line.
Being from the UK, the name 'Rita' never quite sat right with us for Power Rangers. It sounds too much like Rita from down the chip shop, who might ask if you want salt and vinegar with that; or Rita from round the corner, who may or may not be a juvenile delinquent wearing altogether too much makeup. That said, Rita, the witch-like antagonist of the Power Rangers team, definitely doesn’t work in the chip shop. Too much makeup on the other hand…
Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind is a brand new belt-scrolling beat 'em up from Digital Eclipse, a developer better known for their retro remasters and collections in the form of Atari 50 and the recent Tetris Forever. Based on the original '90s incarnation of the show — a Japanese-American co-production that mish-mashed Japan’s Super Sentai action scenes with US-filmed actors — Power Rangers is a logical candidate to join the 2D scrolling beat-'em-up renaissance.

For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.

Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED has joined Valve’s Certified Refurbished programme, offering a much cheaper way of getting your hands on the best handheld PC around. Provided you don’t mind it being in someone else’s first, anyway. As with official refurbs of the original Steam Deck, "certified" Steam Deck OLEDs are formerly-broken models that have been returned to Valve, fixed up and tested in-house, then put back on the market at steep discounts. You’re looking at £389/$439 for the 512GB spec and £459/$519 for 1TB, down from £479/$549 and £569/$649 respectively.

My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and War Thunder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say "his own choomba shot him!" for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pity the "relaxing" games which set out to blanket their players in a wholesome fog. These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. 

Yet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.

At the same time, the related 'TGxGoodies' uploader accounts at other torrent sites have been inactive for days. TorrentGalaxy switched owners earlier this year, but it's unclear what's behind the recent problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Duck Detective's first case was The Secret Salami, which paired its cosy mystery about stolen lunches with a protagonist whose divorce and destitution were played entirely straight despite his being a duck. The results were seemingly delightful, and here comes a sequel.

Duck Detective: The Ghost Of Glamping will offer a further 2-3 hours of mystery-solving and is aiming for release in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.


But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 


Being a "true" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.

If you think that's a desperately cavalier and confusing way to run a news section, I can only suggest that you email a complaint to our news editor. Spoilers: our news editor is me, and I have already thrown your complaint in the bin. Mate, I don't tell you how to do your job, but I'd be more than happy to, if you let me know what it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.

It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a "bogus" phishing report, sent by "AI-powered" brand protection software.
The situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here's a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.

If you were to ask me to list my favourite games, the latest Hitman trilogy would be in the top five, no question. And yet, I must have gotten intimidated at some point with the amount of new updates and all the spiffy unlockable suits I was missing out on, and just haven’t touched it in a couple of years now. Is the appearance of Jean-Claude Van Damme as the game’s newest elusive target enough to reel me back in? I'm not sure, but I will say that I doubt Sean Bean can stretch his legs like that, even with the legendary flexibility offered by O2's famously variable plans. Here’s a trailer.

I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.

Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

Well, you'll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley's winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they've just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just because he's a Nazi. It's because he's a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.
Warning: Here be spoilers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. "It’s fine", I decided. "It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. "If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon."
So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.
(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)

No, the Maw's penchant remains for new PC game releases, and thankfully, they are as thick on the ground as reindeer pelts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Za pár dní má v našich kinech (a po celém světě) premiéru "remasterovaná verze" kultovní animované podívané Interstella 5555. A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten "remaster".
U zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album "Discovery". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi "Space Battleship Yamato"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně "jednodušší" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…]]></summary>

Everyone knows about ‘hardback’ and ‘softback’ books, but have you heard of the quickly discontinued ‘rice puddingback’? While hiring so many rice grain artists to transpose the blurbs in beautiful calligraphy made for an impressive spectacle, they were eventually banned after several fatal train slippage and/or smellage incidents. Ah well!  This week, it’s Charlene Putney, who’s been writing for games for over ten years, including bits for Divinity: Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3, NUTS, and Saltsea Chronicles!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greece is buzzing with news of a historic, landmark decision by a local court, to imprison a person for five months for subscribing to a pirate IPTV service. The news warrants an informed conversation about creators' rights and how the judicial system has sharpened its response to piracy. However, until evidence is produced to the contrary, the story should be stamped "propaganda" and noted for an offense of its own: a distraction from genuine progress in the fight against piracy.

Of the co-op escape room games I've played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.

Escape Simulator 2 will explore "darker escape room themes", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When last we left myself, on a mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 by weaponising its monsters instead of shooting its guns, my one-with-nature experiment was yielding mixed results. At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift.

It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

But enough about working in retail - dungeon crawling action sell’em up Moonlighter is getting a sequel! Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault looks to be just what you want from a follow-up. Created once again by Digital Sun, whose recent works include the excellent Cataclismo, it’s prettier and vaster, with expanded merchanting and deeper dungeoneering. It's out sometime in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world is changing. Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.

I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
