To interact at all with Warframe's Nemesis (Kuva Lich/Sister) system, you must first turn a Progenitor into a Kuva Lich (Grineer) or Sister of Parvo (Corpus). This is done by 'killing' a Progenitor and stabbing him with your Parazon. The next time this Progenitor appears, he will have a name, a staple Element (based on the Warframe you used to kill it), and a serious attitude for you to adjust. More importantly, though, successfully killing this empowered Progenitor will yield a powerful weapon…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that most people have had enough time to finish the gorgeous Silent Hill 2 remake, Bloober Team announced their newest foray into horror territory. I'm talking about Cronos: The New Dawn, which was just been revealed at the Xbox showcase.




The reveal consisted only of a cinematic trailer, but we already know a bit of what to expect.


Cronos will be a new survival horror IP, which seems to fall in line with Bloober's previous statement on abandoning the psychological horror genre. Cronos takes place after "the change", a cataclysmic event that turned a large part of the world's population into vile monstrosities. We play as a "Traveler", an agent looking for time rifts that allow him to go back in time to the '80s. Once there, the Traveler will use his peculiar device, the "harvester", to extract the essence of key people who died in the Apocalypse, and bring them to the present in some capacity.




I'm not keen on showcases featuring no gameplay, but I must admit I enjoyed the vibes on display. Cronos seems to put players in the shoes of a mysterious enforcer who has to deal with undead-like monstrosities and, apparently, old ladies in a post-apocalyptic Eastern European setting. Only one part of what I just mentioned sounds original — and in a weird way — but there's a neat twist. The "Traveler", this guy, or thing we play as, looks way scarier than any of the enemies shown in the trailer. The Traveler looks like a cross between a regular astronaut and the Pyramid Head, which does seem to make a lot of sense for Bloober — and I'm all here for it.


Will Cronos continue Bloober's hot streak? Stay tuned to find out as it releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025.

The clunky HUD and the overly bright Liberty Falls map were the talk of the town, sparking a call for change. Thankfully, the BO6 team has revealed an upcoming update that brings us back to the Zombies we know and love. 


The Call of Duty Zombies Mode Prep post gives us a glimpse of what's changed. First, there's a new look to its Liberty Falls map, which now appears much darker. The location's initial bright appearance didn't go over too well amongst the Zombies community, as the series' maps generally have a doom-and-gloom look. With this new update, we're returning to this approach to up its creepy dynamic. You can take a look at a comparison (the old one on the left and the new one on…]]></summary>

Since then, the studio has been constantly posting updates on its official Twitter/X account.


But one of Argonaut Games' most recent posts revealed a fascinating new piece of information about the development process of Croc: Legend of the Gobbos: Croc was at one point going to be a dragon instead of a crocodile. But that's not the full story.




Argonaut Games will include an Encyclopedia (or "Crocipedia") in the new remaster, which will feature never-before-seen concept art that the studio discovered after its recent rebirth. It already revealed drawings and test animations of Croc as a small, anthropomorphized dragon wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow! It’s whatever day of the week you’re reading this on. If it’s not Friday, it can’t get here fast enough. If it is Friday, TGIF! Select where applicable.


If it isn’t already, the best part of your Friday could be the Destructoid Changelog Newsletter. I’m being hyperbolic, but consider this: how does not being signed up for the Destructoid Changelog Newsletter make it better? It doesn’t! So what have you got to lose?


Every Friday, our newsletter will slip quietly into your inbox. Each one contains the most interesting news of the week, as well as all the reviews and a look at whatever weird thing I’ve been playing (this week it’s Bernband). All of this spiced up with my special brand of inane ramblings and conversational asides. Just like I’m doing right now.


If you’re concerned this might be a trap, you can get a preview of past issues right over here. You mostly just see the introduction, but hopefully, that will put your mind at ease. It’s safe to let your guard down, even for a second.


Once you’re comfortable, there’s something you can do for extra credit. If you refer a friend using a link that’s provided in every issue, you’ll be signed up for our special monthly edition. On the last Monday of every month, we’ll send you an exclusive interview to help you get through the week. Last month, it was with TheCatamites, the creator of Anthology of the Killer. This month, it will be Magicdweedoo of Dryft City Kyngs fame. Imagine having to answer my questions. You can smell their fear.


So, sign up today because of all those reasons I just said. You probably won’t regret it.

But fear not, for I've completed both of the areas, so here's how to complete Wish Land East and West, and the Deviation quest. 


Our first stop is Wishland West. 


Where is the Mystical Crate at Wishland West?


The Mystical crate can be tricky to find, given how confusing this spot is. You'll find the mystical crate in the mansion at the top of the amusement park, but it's no easy feat to find, so here's a step-by-step on how to navigate there.

Your first task is to locate the giant octopus head in Wish Land. Its mouth is the entrance you need, so take a look around and then make your way up there.

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Phasmophobia made its frightening debut on PC, console players have eagerly awaited their shot at the popular ghost-hunting game. Even though the chances seemed slim, the time has finally come for everyone to experience the horrific journey. Here's when to expect Phasmophobia to release on consoles.


Phasmophobia console release date, explained 


According to the game's recent trailer, Phasmophobia will debut on consoles on Oct. 29, 2024, just in time for Halloween. Early Access will be available for PlayStation 5, PSVR2, and Xbox X|S. However, this does not include the Xbox Game Pass, as there are currently no plans for this subscription service. You can now wishlist the game on the PlayStation and Microsoft stores. 


Image via Kinetic Games


The only setback is that voice recognition may only be available until after the console launch. This feature allows PC users to communicate with the ghosts with a Spirit Box, utilizing recognized phrases. Console users will, instead, use text input. However, Kinetic Games is working on this mechanic to possibly get it ready for launch.


Phasmophobia will cost $19.99 upon release, showcasing a six-dollar increase from its current version. The Eventide update will also be available, bringing the terrors of the Point Hope map. In the future, new updates are expected to launch simultaneously on all platforms. So, there's no need to worry about console or PC-exclusive content.


Cross-play features will also be available for all players, allowing you to experience the horrors of Phasmophobia with everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy have released the first proper in-game trailer for Alan Wake 2's second expansion, The Lake House. It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For quite a long time after obtaining the console, Killing Time was the only game I owned on my 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. I started it up, played for maybe 20 minutes, and then decided I’d probably be better off with the PC version. I wasn’t entirely correct on that.


I didn’t even get around to playing the PC version, but I learned with the announcement of Killing Time: Resurrected that there are stark differences between the two versions. The 3DO version had digitized sprites of actors as enemies, while the PC version swapped them out for 3D renders, which… well, I wouldn’t say they’re worse, but you lose some of that 1995 charm, which Killing Time is packed with.

Developer Powersnake took to the Future Games Show Spring Showcase earlier this year to reveal Voidwrought, an upcoming horror metroidvania that seems to have more than a little Hollow Knight peppered in its DNA.
This one launches on the Switch eShop on 24th October, throwing us into a creepy underground world packed with crafty combat and perilous platforming — ring any bells? The art style and movement mechanics instantly put us in mind of Team Cherry's masterpiece, but this doesn't seem to be any old hollow imitation (god knows we've seen some of them), with an underlying shrine-building objective appearing much more optimistic than the dark and down-trodden world of Hallownest.

Nightdive Studios’ quest to revive some of gaming’s most bizarre and long-forgotten treasures shows no signs of slowing down. With the release of PO’ed: Definitive Edition earlier this year, it was a clear-cut signal that the team is ready and willing to embrace titles that may not be the most recognisable in an increasingly crowded market, but nevertheless represent and preserve them, unearthing titles that would otherwise have fallen ever further into obscurity.
Killing Time: Resurrected, originally developed by Studio 3DO and released in 1995, is another example of Nightdive’s valiant endeavour to spruce up curios, and from a technical point of view at least, it’s one of the studio’s most impressive efforts yet. Its presentation has been greatly enhanced while still retaining everything that made this 3DO FPS so unique, resulting in a product that frankly makes the original release borderline obsolete.

Although many might mistake the above for the ability to teleport, they are not quite the same. So that you can win all loops and keep your opponent guessing, here are all the ways to vanish in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.


How to Vanish in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero


A key maneuver, you can perform a standard defensive vanish move (or High-Speed Evasion) in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero by pressing guard —R1/RB (Standard) or O/B (Classic)— at the moment an attack is about to hit you.

We really wanted to love The Plucky Squire when it landed on Switch last month. Unfortunately, poor performance and a swathe of bugs meant that All Possible Futures' storybook adventure wasn't quite as plucky as we would have hoped.
The developer has released a handful of updates in the time since, trying to improve the game as it stands and today, we've landed another.

The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

Those brave enough to tap Brawl Stars' Do Not Enter tab will end up on a page with a mysterious book. If you hit it enough times, it will result in a Mortis jumpscare to give you a little fright.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe's last prime frame, Sevagoth, was released in late August, so it's likely we'll see another one before the year's out. (Probably somewhere around when Warframe: 1999 drops.) But who's coming next? Sevagoth marked a major change in the release cadence of prime frames, which has led many to speculate that Xaku Prime will be the next addition to Warframe.


People are still digesting the Koumei & the Five Fates update like the new frame or the tons of QOL added, but others are looking toward the future. Xaku would be the first non-binary prime Warframe, which would explain why Sevagoth changed how prime frames release. So, here's everything you need to know about Warframe's next prime frame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

The game has gone through proper turmoil in these twelve months, and Starbreeze aims to celebrate that it's finally on the right path with a huge QoL update, the highlight of which is the server browser.


Part 2 of Payday 3's big anniversary update is now slated to hit the game on October 30, and it will include a whole host of improvements, such as the aforementioned server browser. While this isn't even remotely as flashy of an addition as Part 1's new heister, minigun, and assorted cosmetics, it is far more important for the long-term health of the game and a sign of things to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When does the Astro Bot DLC come out? After being announced for a fall 2024 release, I'm pleased to say that the Astro Bot speedrun levels and new bots are coming... today. The first wave of fresh content begins now with weekly releases until next month.


Team Asobi's studio director, Nicolas Doucet, surprise-announced the DLC drop date yesterday via the PlayStation Blog. Doucet briefly thanked fans of the game, which launched to stellar praise on September 6, 2024. Today's DLC is the first of many. Expect a new level and two additional bot friends once a week until November 14, 2024. 


Here's the release schedule:



October 17: Building Speed  


October 24: Let it Slide 


October 31: Spring-loaded Run 


November 7: Helium Heights 


November 14: Rising Heat



Newest Astro Bot speedrun level lets you very quickly take your dog for a walk


The newest level available to play today is Building Speed. The high-flying level requires you to use the power of Barkster, the bulldog boost pack. Building Speed is a massive carwash that includes walls to smash, swinging cranes, bounce pads, and steep drops. Check out the trailer below to see if it's something you want to fly through soon.




The level introduces two new bots for you to add to your crew. Sadly, we won't know what new bots are available just yet — you'll have to play it to find out. The Sony State of Play confirmed Helldiver bots and Eve from Stellar Blade back in September. Overall, there will be 10 new bots — two per level — to rescue.


The Astro Bot DLC will also be free to all owners of the game. This is great news for those who have done just about everything, from completing levels to rescuing hundreds of bots. Doucet ends the blog post by teasing "even more surprises coming soon." Astro Bot is so good, that I think I'm fine hearing about even more stuff to check out.

Well then, perhaps you'll empathise with the enemies in Archons, a twin-stick Vampire Survivors-like where you control two characters at once, and attacks bounce between them automatically as they move about the arena. I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's entitled to one good scare.
The Halloween franchise is a complicated beast. You’ve got the original timeline, the Thorn timeline, the H20 timeline, the Blumhouse timeline, the Rob Zombie remakes and, finally, the adorably weird loner that is Season of the Witch. It’s all a bit overwhelming at the best of times, so thankfully, RetroRealms: Halloween strips away all of the nonsense and gets down to what fans love best: serial killer Michael Myers embarking on a vicious, knife-wielding rampage.
The best part is that you get to play as Myers himself stalking through a series of levels inspired by the film series, most notably the 1978 original. Naturally, it would be a bit harsh for every ‘enemy’ in the game to be innocent babysitters and their woefully gullible partners (though there are a few), so instead you're dealing with similarly deranged killers to appease a demonic overlord that gifts Myers the ability to shift over into the Dark Realm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Groovy.
Given the sheer absurdity of the Evil Dead franchise, it’s a wonder we haven’t received anything quite like RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead in the past. Yes, there have been a handful of video games featuring everyone’s favourite boomstick-wielding drunkard Ash Williams, but this latest effort from developer WayForward and publisher Boss Team Games is arguably the best yet. It takes the setting of the Ash vs Evil Dead TV series and combines it with razor-sharp gameplay, gorgeous pixel-art visuals, and a hub area that will delight dedicated fans of the horror genre.
While there is a vague plot with Ash vs Evil Dead, it’s more concerned with capturing the essence of the franchise with its gameplay and visuals. After all, if simply eviscerating hordes of Deadites with a chainsaw and shotgun feels fun and keeps you playing, then that’s really all that matters. And make no mistake, it is very fun.

While we still don't have an official price for it just yet (or a release date, for that matter), the reveal packed in a rundown of some sweet features to expand on the "quality" promise.

After targeting a residential address and four business addresses in the West Midlands, police say a 38-year-old man was detained on suspicion of copyright and money laundering offenses. Police also shared photos taken during the operation, a relative rarity these days but a welcome source of additional information nonetheless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent chat with the Ian Games Network, IO Interactive boss Hakan Abrak said the Hitman developer "absolutely feel(s) like 20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy, creating an agent that travels the world and globetrotting whatnot, has given us some know-how" on bringing James Bond to the greasy screen ("greasy screen" is my new attempt at coining a "the big/small screen" but for games. I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

Hazelight Studio's co-op platformer It Takes Two has officially sold over 20 million copies since its initial launch in 2021.
This comes via an announcement from the official social media account confirming the milestone, accompanied by an image of the game's protagonists, Cody and May. It's important to note that the platform split for this isn't available, so it's unclear how many Switch copies have been sold specifically.

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all.

At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My earliest memory of the Commandos series of tactical stealth games was my dad bringing home a box copy of the original. “The missions take months. Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. 
Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. 420BlazeIt 2 has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.

Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sektori promises to "transport you into another state of consciousness", but what the pulsing soundtrack initially did was transport me to Youtube so I could look up this scene from Spaced, where Michael Smiley raves out to a boiling kettle. By elegant coincidence, that video is about the length of my longest run so far in Sektori's demo - a very busy 60 seconds or so.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti. "So when we stumbled into Mörk Borg, and then we started to play, we looked at each other in the eyes and said, 'Why don't we make a game out of it?'"

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

Cosy experiences where nothing goes wrong and you have absolutely zero things to investigate and no otherworldly mysteries to worry about. It may shock you to learn that we were recently duped by "normal" gardening sim Grunn, which was not normal at all. But don't worry, it won't happen again. Today we bring you the ordinary and not-one-bit-suspicious Trip, which sees players wandering from carriage to carriage, chatting pleasantly with passengers during a long train journey. How long? Let me look at the timetable here, let's see... "Forever," it says. Hm. Must be a misprint.

This question has plagued the games industry since Nintendo first allowed millions of unsupervised children to play god with Mii avatars and their customisable peepers. In low-stakes fishing game Webfishing, you can give your fuzzy avatar one of 33 styles of eye (I counted). This is the mark of a solid Animal Crossing-like. There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

I was very close to buying the recent remake, actually, until I watched the extended prank scene online and realized, oh no, they’re taking themselves seriously now. They prestige-ified it. It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a hard day's editing articles about three Disco Elysium spiritual successors - each more politically outspoken than the last, in a kind of Sophisticated Pooh collage of escalating Marxism - I like to kick back with a nice chill game about Lovecraftian space monsters. 
That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those two other Disco Elysium "spiritual successors" you read about today were but filthy pretenders, or at best, the thesis and antithesis resulting in this afternoon's triumphant synthesis.* The real Disco Elysium spiritual successor is whatever they're making at Summer Eternal, a just-announced "art collective/RPG studio" founded by a group of, once more with feeling, former Disco Elysium developers.
The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few games demonstrate the disconnect between graphics and aesthetic like Metaphor: ReFantazio. A pure technical analysis would conclude that it has the fidelity of an early Nintendo Switch game at best, and yet anyone whose heart flickers with even the tiniest ember of sentiment will instantly fall in love with its lavish pause screen animations. Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fire up the Steam page for Stellaris, one of my favourite space sims, and you will see 28 pieces of DLC, ranging from free character portraits to £35 expansion passes that span a bunch of species and story packs. Stablemate Europa Universalis 4 has 37 DLC packs under its banner, while Cities Skylines is streets ahead with a whopping 62. Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions. It's seemingly this, as much as their institutional expertise with 4X, that justifies their commitment to grand strategy games, whose worlds and systems can be fleshed out for literal decades.

They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective RPG. Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel have announced their latest batch of desktop CPUs, the Core Ultra 200S series, and it's got the component giants singing quite a different tune. Instead of trying to stuff in ever more threads, and ever more PC-incinerating clock speeds, the Core Ultra 200S family – spearheaded by the Core Ultra 9 285K when it launches later this year – will dial back certain specs compared the 14th Gen range. Instead, the focus will be on power efficiency and lowering temperatures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A paper aeroplane falls at my feet, with a note written inside: "Even through everything that has happened... I never stopped loving you." Kind Words 2 is full of touching and drifting remarks like this, written by other players and tossed into the winds for you to find. If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive delayed jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

As spotted by PC Gamer, some garbled lines the player hears upon first picking up the game’s radio weren’t quite garbled enough in the Italian subtitles, accidentally dropping a massive plot spoiler in the first half hour. Stop reading now if you’re still playing, obviously. Here’s a video of a cat that sounds like he’s saying “bongiorno” you can watch instead.

On his return, Dotcom said X had suspended his account, based on an extremely serious allegation. After accusing Elon Musk of failing to help, yesterday Dotcom warned that a Trump loss would see Musk indicted and "fighting for his life." Dotcom has a plan to avoid extradition; chaos like this provides the fuel.

Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

You open the locker and grab the key and insert it into the safety override panel with a satisfying click. You see the plastic casing spring open and the red button emerge. You press it and listen to the sirens whirr. You grab the steering wheel and yank it.

The colourful game about a troubled arena fighter retiring into a life of lapsang souchong and repressed urges to do sudden violence had previously been planned for a release some time in 2024, according to the developer's original announcement. But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

And if space is the sole concern, it’s hard to get more substantial than the 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra. Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US. Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK.

Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m acutely aware someone on RPS, usually me, ends up dealsposting about the Samsung Pro Plus every time there’s a big hardware sale going on.

That’s £38 (down from £74) in the UK, and $40 (down from $76) in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the more compelling arguments for gaming graphics degrowth is that all those extreme-fidelity moss textures and Master Chief helmet dents are producing some horrifically engorged installation sizes. That’s a recipe for an SSD upgrade, and if it’s space you’re after, then Amazon Prime Big Deal Days has the 4TB Crucial P3 Plus on some big discounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny deck builder Combo Critters exhibits the winning combination common to both small games and radical breakfast cereals - it’s very crunchy, but also bright, sugary and moreish. If Thaddius Cornflakes had recommended struggling families play Combo Critters instead of eating Cookie Crisp for dinner, I imagine the backlash would have been far more reserved. Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also free from Itch here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Výtvarně nádherné, ale jinak... Jako kdyby si v DreamWorks řekli "VALL-I, Železný obr a Laputa byly fajn, ale moc sofistikované. Pojďme natočit něco pro NORMÁLNÍ děti!" A to je škoda, protože tenhle film si klade potenciálně velmi zajímavé otázky, ale většinu z nich ignoruje na úkor roztomilých zvířátek a ujetého robota.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Film má docela originální námět, ze kterého by mohlo vzniknout něco opravdu unikátního, kdyby měl lepší scénář, lepšího režiséra a lepší herce. Takhle je to 10 zajímavých minut na začátku, pak hodina nudy a pak 30 minut WTF, ve kterých už není možné nijak soucítit s nikým na plátně a bylo mi srdečně jedno, co se vlastně "doopravdy" stalo.

Znovu se ukazuje, že Sláma bravurně zvládá drobné situace, ale má problémy s dvouhodinovým, někam směřujícím dějem. Krobot je jako obvykle úžasný. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
