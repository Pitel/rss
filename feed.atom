This isn't a new port of Doom 1993 running on some made piece of hardware like an electric toothbrush or a sex toy. It's the classic FPS built to run inside Fortnite using Unreal Engine for Fortnite.

This question is extremely valid if you have played the game on a PC in any of the last few years. While developers like EA Sports had shifted games like FIFA 23 and F1 23 to next-gen, 2K decided otherwise for their basketball video game. However, something in NBA 2K headquarters has changed because NBA 2K25 will finally have the same version running on PC, PS5, and the Xbox Series XlS.


NBA 2K25 PC version's upgrade to next-gen was badly due

At launch, Once Human had a few issues with its privacy policy and players being unable to use controllers, but developer Starry Studio worked with fans to explain how it was approaching the release and what the future of the game looks like. No console support doesn't exactly spell doom for console ports of the game, but the future doesn't look as promising on that front as it does for the PC version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you’re taking part in the Final Fantasy XIV Shared FATEs grind, trying to level up your Jobs, or otherwise just farming for Bicolor Gemstones, you should definitely pay attention to the Forlorn. 


The Forlorn, and its less buffy cousin, the Forlorn Maiden, have been around since Stormblood and have a chance to appear during FATEs. They’re drawn to the battlefield by the smell of death, and while it’s easy to ignore them and focus on the task at hand, killing the Forlorn will reward you with some really useful perks. 


The buffs provided by both the Forlorn Maiden and the Forlorn will stack on top of bonuses provided by FATEs with a bonus arrow marked on the map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of glamour items in Final Fantasy XIV. Some of them are sleek, some of them are dark, and others are just plain hilarious. A new glamour of the last variety was added with Dawntrail, the Mica Suit, but it’s not exactly easy to get. 


To begin with, you’ll need at least one class at level 100 - this isn’t too hard, you can pretty easily level all the way through the MSQ alone. Then, you’ll need to unlock flight in Living Memory by unlocking all of the Aether Currents in the area. This isn’t exactly vital, provided you have a generous friend who doesn’t mind flying you to the very specific location, but it’s definitely recommended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your territory is home base in Once Human. You’ll probably be returning there before and after every excursion. Your journey, however, will take you all across the big world, so there’s no need for it to stay planted.


There are a lot of reasons for why you might want to move your territory. You may want to move it so it’s closer to the region where you’re currently tackling missions. Or maybe you’ve found a nicer spot with a better view where you’d like to plant some roots. Thankfully, actually moving your base is easy. So easy that there really isn’t any reason not to.


To move your territory, simply go into the build mode (B button) in any region of the map that isn’t a stronghold or active enemy area. You will then get a list of actions and what button they’re assigned to. By default, Z is what you use to relocate your territory. Press that, and an outline of your base will appear, allowing you to select an available and valid spot to build it.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:



Your base will always be moved complete, so you don’t need to rebuild anything.


You don’t need to spend any components to make the move.



As such, there’s no reason to be afraid to move your base. Even if you decide that you’re not enjoying the new spot or feel that your old location was better, you can simply repeat the process to put it back where it was. It’s easy once you know how to do it.

The Cerulean Amber Medallion +3 can be found in the Scorpion River Catacombs on the northwest section of the map. Getting it, however, is going to take some effort. The medallion is an award for clearing the boss of the catacombs, and they don't plan on giving up easily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sixth man.
It's been almost two years since Nintendo Switch Sports' last major update with the addition of Golf. The patch left us feeling decidedly "whelmed" — it was a nice add-on, but nothing special after having played Wii Sports and its Resort follow-up. With Basketball, the latest sport to join the roster, we expected more of the same. And, after checking out all of the game modes in single-player and local multiplayer, we were right to be confident in our assumptions.
Like the other seven available sports, Basketball offers a watered-down take on shooting hoops with simple controls that allow you to pick up and play in minutes. Move the Joy-Con up and down to dribble the ball, press 'X' to pass the ball, hold ZR and flick your wrist to shoot the ball. Those after-crossover moves and alley-oop plays are better off looking elsewhere (though even NBA 2K has taken a bit of a dive on Switch lately), but if you want to hit the virtual court with everyone from your pals to your parents, then Switch Sports' simplicity is still tough to beat.

That's something I learned firsthand while customizing my Rook within BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year during my cover story visit. We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read Game Informer’s in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here for more details – our Rook's shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. 
And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. "This is a mature RPG," she tells me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you play Once Human and introduce friends to the game, you may occasionally encounter situations where you spawn in different worlds. 


Swapping servers can solve this situation, but doing so is more challenging than pressing a quick world switch button. Here's how to change worlds in Once Human.


How to change worlds in Once Human


There are two ways to change worlds in Once Human:



Locate a teleportation tower and change to another world.


Create a new character on a different game server.



Finding a teleportation tower is the easiest way to change servers without losing progress. However, if you're new to Once Human and are okay with losing a few minutes of progress, you can quickly head to the main menu, pick a new server, and start fresh on another character.

Alongside a trailer that showcases what it includes, the company announced Value Boosters, a new type of booster pack that fans don't see any value in whatsoever.


According to Wizards of the Coast, Value Boosters, which will be introduced with the Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow set, are "a smaller, lighter booster that contain a handful of new cards any fan can enjoy—a budget-friendly way to experience Bloomburrow." However, fans have two major issues with the new packs. First, Wizards of the Coast has only just consolidated all of its Booster types, and second, this Booster type seems designed to make newcomers spend more money to guarantee good pulls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France might have made their exit from the Euros, but you can still unlock the Marcus Thuram Path to Glory card for free in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team. 


Thuram's special card is part of the latest objective set which can be completed in Ultimate Team. As usual, there are different tasks with pre-mentioned conditions. Let's take a look at what you need to undertake to get this special version of the Inter Milan forward. 


EA FC 24 Marcus Thuram Path to Glory objective tasks


The Marcus Thuram Path to Glory objective requires you to play the Champions mode with a team full of German players.  



Play 3: Play 3 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.


Play 6: Play 6 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.


Play 9: Play 9 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.


Play 11: Play 11 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.


Win 4: Win 4 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.


Win 6: Win 6 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.


Win 10: Win 10 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.


Win 12: Win 12 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Germany.



Completing this objective set is difficult, as winning 12 finals matches in EA FC 24 with only German cards isn't easy. However, Thuram's card is pretty decent in terms of stats, but sadly, it can't get any more upgrades as France has has been eliminated from the Euro championships. 


Additionally, you'll also get special packs by completing all the eight tasks that are part of the objective set.

The Turtles' Apple Arcade adventure has been billed as a "bodacious TMNT co-op experience" since it was first announced for Switch at the April 2024 Indie World Showcase, but we didn't know whether this would be limited to an online capacity or whether it would be possible to bark instructions at your friends in-person while playing — you know, the way any Turtles game should be enjoyed. Fortunately, we now know that the latter will be available at launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PTG: The Knockouts Upgrade SBC is an amazing opportunity available now for all EA FC 24 players to improve their Ultimate Team squads with guaranteed promo cards. 


This time, you're guaranteed to get a Path to Glory item, and only the Knockouts cards are included in the pool of available rewards. This automatically discards several items of footballers who have already been eliminated in the group stages. The chances of getting a higher-rated card with four playstyle+ are pretty high. Let's take a look at all the possible items you could find after completing the challenge. 


All EA FC 24 PTG: The Knockouts Upgrade SBC rewards


Here are all the cards that are part of the pool of rewards. 



Osorio CM 93


Rodriguez ST 93


Jhon Lucumi CB 93


Jose Maria Gimenez CB 93


Wendell LB 94


Yangel Herrera CM 94


Facundo Pellistri RW 94


Matheus Nunes CM 94


Manuel Akanji CB 94


Ferran Torres LW 95


Jesus Navas RB 95


Matthijs De Ligt CB 95

Giovanni Lo Celso CAM 96


Kai Havertz CAM 97


Cristiano Ronaldo ST 97



Do note that these overall ratings are the base values, and most of these cards have now received boosts and more playstyle+. Their values have increased, and some of them could improve more in the days to come. 




How to complete PTG: The Knockouts Upgrade SBC in EA FC 24


Completing this SBC is pretty easy, as there are only two tasks. Here are the conditions that have to be met while submitting the squads.


Task 1 - 84-Rated Squad



Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - 87-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 87



Once you complete the challenge, you'll get a special pack containing one of the Knockouts players mentioned above.

There’s a good chance that you don’t have Beryllium Crystals already in your inventory, and you can craft them. So, where do you find Beryllium Crystals?


As mentioned, you can’t craft or forge Beryllium Crystals; you need to loot them. However, you need to loot them from a specific area, which is anywhere that is level 10-20.


Look to the South. Broken Delta is filled with areas in the level range, and they all provide Beryllium Crystals. It doesn’t have to be an area around a Rift Anchor, either. Any camp or settlement will have them for looting.

You’ll want to find supply crates scattered around. They’re fairly common once you’re in the right level range, so you shouldn’t have trouble finding enough to craft what you need.


It’s also worth noting that you don’t have to be in the level range to access these areas and get Beryllium Crystals. Depending on the difficulty of the server, you can probably survive fairly early. So, if you want to craft tier 2 equipment, it’s worth taking a tour of the Broken Delta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FC 24, the popular football simulation game, features many goal celebrations that you can perform after scoring a goal. Some of these celebrations are only possible to execute in offline modes.


EA has removed some celebrations from online modes after fans had labeled these as toxic celebrations. There are a couple of them in this list, while they are also popular celebrations that you can use in online modes such as Ultimate Team. Here are the top 10 celebrations in FC 24:


10. Tea (Alex Morgan's signature celebration)


This is a personal favourite of mine, and it can be used as a celebration to signify a calm personality in FC 24. It can also be related to the famous Kermit the Frog meme where he is sipping on tea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?]]></summary>

Announced by publisher Live Wire, the reasoning provided for the delisting is that the licensing agreement for the Switch version has expired. It seems that rather than attempt to renew the agreement, the best course of action for Live Wire at this time is to remove it from sale entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gang's all here.
Technos’ Kunio-kun titles, a 42-strong series dabbling in various genres, began in 1986 as a simple arena brawler. Its most popular entries, however, were those that incorporated non-linear role-playing elements based around soap operatic high school thuggery. Anyone familiar with those titles, specifically on Famicom, Super Famicom, and later Nintendo 3DS, will totally understand how Fading Afternoon functions.
Developer Yeo (real name Vadim Gilyazetdinov), hailing from Moscow, has coded several titles of a similar ilk, known collectively as his Existential Dilogy. The former titles, The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa (2018) and Arrest of a Stone Buddha (2020) also borrowed from the Kunio-kun format. While notable for their experimentation and ambition, it feels like everything Yeo was seeking to perfect has come to fruition in his latest title, Fading Afternoon. Underpinned by a thoughtful, reflective narrative, everything from concept to execution is carried off with confidence and panache.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes "juicy". They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

Yes, yes, it’s a metaphor, but we don’t have time for all that. Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I'm now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

Even fantastic games like Baldur's Gate 3 suffered from this overly obliging approach to relationships. A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.

Remember Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood? Maybe you don't for various reasons, but the DS game was the first ever Sonic the Hedgehog RPG — and the last.
However, in a recent interview with Good Vibes Gaming, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka spoke about his desire to make an RPG starring Sonic, admitting that he has asked himself "Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time?". It seems like Iizuka-san might have forgotten about Sonic Chronicles, but we'll let him off — it was developed by BioWare, after all.

After a year and a bit, we thought we had seen just about all of the weirdness that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had to offer. But the glitches, wild builds and hidden secrets all pale in comparison to what we're dubbing the 'HBA' (Hyrule Basketball Association) because, as it turns out, TOTK's Moblin's can ball (thanks, GamesRadar).
Okay, perhaps we're stretching things a little bit here. There's no secret location in Tears where you can catch four Moblins in a pick-up game or anything like that, but in the right environment, these beastly baddies will start putting up jumpers like they're after a spot on the All-Star roster. And by "jumpers" we mean picking up their smaller Bokoblin buddies and yeeting them through an Ultrahand-built hoop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Come again..?
Remember Tengen? From 1987 to 1994, it was a subsidiary of Atari Games focused on creating unlicensed titles for the NES by attempting to circumvent Nintendo's licensee restrictions. After obtaining a copy of the Nintendo lock-out program, Tengen was well on its way to creating its own NES cartridges. However, Nintendo promptly sued Tengen which eventually led to the company being consolidated into Time Warner (Atari Games' parent company at the time).
Now, in 2024, one sole developer by the name of Jeff Silvers has managed to acquire the Tengen name and has used this to create a brand new company called 'Tengen Games'. According to the website, Silvers had conducted research in 2022 and discovered that nobody owned the Tengen name at the time, so simply began a lengthy process of officially registering it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The registration is now currently in the 'final stages' of completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Read enough of our hardware articles and you’ll eventually come across someone, probably me or Katharine (RPS in peace), banging on about the Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless. After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation's PC efforts are paying off, if the latest U.S. Video Game Market Highlights report from analyst group Circana is any indication. That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…]]></summary>

The remaining funds have come from users in the US ($17m) and Taiwan ($4m), AppMagic's data continues.

According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most adorable spy mission you'll ever play.
Listen up, Spy x Family fans. Operation Strix is on and the only way to ensure world peace is to help Anya Forger with her homework. In the case of Spy x Anya: Operation Memories, that means taking her to lots of fun places and taking pictures of her while she does adorable things. It is a low-stakes, cosy adventure that will make fans of the Spy x Family smile and leave everyone else scratching their heads in confusion.
The confusion isn’t because the game is particularly complicated – it is actually delightfully, relaxingly simple. However, unless you are familiar with the characters and jokes of Spy x Family, most of the plot of Spy x Anya is going to go straight over your head. The game assumes that you know the overall goal of Operation Strix and that each of the Forgers has a secret they are keeping from everyone else. Loid is a spy. Yor is an assassin. Anya can read minds. Even the dog can see the future.

Sure, we might drop into Hyrule to mop up a couple more quest, do some more exploring or get lost in the wonder of it all, but, generally speaking, we're done.
The same cannot be said for speedrunner and content creator SmallAnt. After announcing that he had reached the hallowed 100% completion rate within the first two weeks of the game's launch, you might think that the streamer would also be finished with Link's latest adventure. You would be wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio-killing fallout of Embracer's acquisition frenzy continues to fall like ash on the industry. The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting "don't write us off yet!" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of "dark strategy" or "horror strategy" games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from The Fabulous Fear Machine to The Tribe Must Survive, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes.

Despite this, Hideki Kamiya has revealed that its development team was, on the whole, pretty weak. This comes via a new video from 'UNSEEN' on YouTube in which Kamiya and Ikumi Nakamura sit down to discuss their history together, particularly Ōkami's development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ukrainian city of Mariupol came under heavy bombardment during the opening months of Russia's invasion in 2022, a programme of artillery and air strikes that damaged or destroyed the majority of residential buildings and has killed or dispossessed thousands of people. It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat: 
And here's a look at the game's avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There's no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

We live in a cruel universe. The excellent, stylish racing game is still playable if you do own a copy, however, and it just received a fan update that'll make it run better on modern machines.

Two days after returning home from my vacation in Japan, Tokyo-based developer Nagai Industries Inc. released a trailer for its upcoming adventure game, InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…]]></summary>

If the Court of Justice's judgment ultimately favors Sony, the implications are likely to reach far beyond a device designed to interact with a game console discontinued a decade ago. For the greater good, it's a case that Sony must lose and for once in a copyright lawsuit, things are headed in the right direction.

But I like Isles of Sea and Sky. From starting it almost on a whim, I was playing and figuring things out with zero fuss and no overt tutorialising pretty much immediately, and from there suddenly found that several hours had breezed by without frustration or boredom.

It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.

A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.
A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.

That perfume bottle and lightning combo? Binned off. Everyone's favourite summon Blackknife Tiche? She's seen a certain health-regen bug fixed, so everyone's not being duped into thinking she's been heavily nerfed since the Shadow Lands sprung forth.

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the …]]></summary>

And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. 
https://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM
June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.
For more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.]]></summary>

I have a lot of material, oodles of interviews with developers of all shapes and sizes - big shops like Remedy and CD Projekt, smaller studios like Ace Team and Awaceb, all holding forth on such topics as whether Elden Ring or Zelda did bandit camps better, and how you make a forest feel endless. There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This February, Spanish football league LaLiga obtained a court order that supposedly allowed it to pursue mere viewers of pirate IPTV. A local court soon clarified that viewers would not be targeted. However, letters from LaLiga's lawyers, demanding 450 euros to prevent legal action, run counter to those assurances. That the letters appear to rely on evidence supplied by Spanish ISPs, indicating which of their customers accessed specific 'pirate' servers, is of even greater concern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

The reveal trailer features a look at the hybrid racing game, which allows players to select Autobots and Decepticons, use them in combat encounters in Bot Mode, and race as them in each Transformer's Alt Mode. You can play solo or against a friend.
Check it out for yourself in the Transformers: Galactic Trials trailer below: 


"Evil Nemesis Prime has stolen the Prime Relics, which bestow incredible powers on whoever possesses them," the game's description reads. "Now, the Autobots and Decepticons are in an explosive race to recover the relics – the future of Cybertron is in your hands. 
"Choose your character from icons like Bumblebee, Megatron, and Optimus Prime. Speed into action on battle-race circuits, drift and boost to charge up Energon, then unleash devastating special moves in battle. And use your experience to unlock new skills, characters, and skins. It's the ultimate test of your favorite Transformers' abilities, which will decide the future of Cybertron."

One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

Also, it’s coming to Steam! I’ve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it’s also confirmed for PC. Get in!

That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here.

"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed," goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know. I'm a gamer, not an ideas man.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of speedy first-person shooter Selaco have dropped a big patch for the retro blaster, adding new weapon upgrades and mutators that can change the game's difficulty in piecemeal ways, like making enemies stronger for an added challenge. There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. "We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons," the developers say. But wait, isn't there a slide kick in the game already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may or may not have seen Black Myth: Wukong impressions floating around as of late. Some claim it's not a Soulslike, or is merely Soulslike-adjacent. Some say it's a "boss rush" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

Now the board game's first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it's called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."

Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 3 3300X

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mika and The Witch's Mountain appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of Kiki's Delivery Service, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

Numbers you’d previously shunned for being too high have suddenly gotten smaller, and purchases have shifted categories from impractical to impulsively justifiable. It’s the Steam Summer Sale 2024! There’s no rush, of course. It runs until the 11th of July. Still, to help you navigate the meatily chummed waters of Sales Lagoon, Horace has decided to reward our combined years of service with a crisp ten bob note each to spend on games. We’ve been bringing up the whole “getting paid” thing for ages, so this is a real win for us. Here’s how we’re all spending that tenner in the sale.

I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact I think it's very good. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it's a great thing, personally.

They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payday 3 launched last year to dismal reviews, due to bugs and features from Payday 2 that were absent in the sequel. One such piece of missing functionality was the ability to play alone or offline, but an update coming today makes some progress towards fixing that with the addition of "Solo Mode".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first big look at Concord, PlayStation's upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter, during a State of Play last month. And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes. 
 Check it out for yourself in the Concord NGT below:

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

You are jaded city worker Isla, and you are here to search for your missing brother, who was himself searching for the mystical mountain of Albatroz - locally known as "the walking mountain", for reasons that you will never guess. There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

Metaphor: ReFantazio, the first (going by the colon usage) in a new series of RPGs helmed by Persona series director Katsura Hashino, is no exception. It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

What I hadn't expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It's made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring's open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. 
Check out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below:

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced that Thirsty Suitors, last year’s skateboarding cooking RPG, has joined its roster of games. Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.
Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …]]></summary>

At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 is no more, but in its place a new different kind of summer video game show has emerged. It's Summer Game Fest... and friends? Geoff Keighley's show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby. Whatever we want to call it, it has created a lot of content for our website (and the coming issues of the magazine) and below you will find a nearly comprehensive list of everything we wrote this weekend. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
