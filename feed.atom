        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony teased an exciting AI reveal last week and today, it unveiled Gran Turismo Sophy, a new AI developed in partnership with Polyphony Digital that races vehicles so well that it outperforms professional GT drivers. 
On the surface, it looks like a very good driving AI and if you’re anything like me, you’ve had your butt kicked by AI drivers in the likes of Need for Speed, Dirt, and even Gran Turismo before. However, Sony’s presentation today, which included speakers from Polyphony Digital including Gran Turismo 7 producer Kazunori Yamauchi, showcased just how great Sophy is at Gran Turismo.

Red alert: Shigesato Itoi, the creator of the Mother series, just tweeted about the Nintendo Direct happening later today, sending fans wild with speculation about the imminent surprise release of an English translation of Mother 3. Or an Earthbound port to the Nintendo Switch. There are no other reasons he would tweet about a Nintendo Direct, surely?
Well, he is also a retired game developer in his 70s, who probably enjoys watching video game reveals. And Mother 3 is about as likely as Half-Life 3 at this point, or Sakurai putting your mum in Smash Bros. Still, a fan can dream, no?

        <updated>2022-02-09T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard, one of the first questions was whether Call of Duty and the publisher's other existing titles would eventually become Xbox exclusives. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer quickly stated that Microsoft plans to honor existing contractual agreements between Sony and Activision regarding Call of Duty specifically and vaguely expressed a desire to keep the series on PlayStation. 
Though pretty definitive, the second bit of Phil's statement left room for interpretation. A new blog post by Microsoft further clarifies its commitment to keeping Activision Blizzard titles multiplatform. The post, which discusses a new set of Microsoft Store principles in preparation for the Activision acquisition approval process, says the following:
In short, Microsoft will continue to allow future Call of Duty entries and other titles to remain multiplatform even after they're not legally required to. You can still interpret this message to refer to existing franchises with established fanbases. New IPs could be a different story. But for now, those who want to continue playing Overwatch, Diablo, or Crash Bandicoot on multiple consoles seemingly have nothing to worry about in the long term. 
As a reminder, assuming Microsoft's acquisition passes the lengthy government approval process, the deal isn't expected to close until around the summer of 2023. Activision Blizzard continues to operate as an independent entity until that time. If/when that happens, it's good to know that whatever dead Activision franchises Microsoft chooses to resurrect have a strong chance of appearing on non-Xbox platforms.]]></summary>

Join Game Informer at 3:30 p.m. CT for our official watch-along and preshow live on Twitch!
Your hosts for the occasion are none other than The Council of Alexes (Stadnik and Van Aken). The two Alexes are here to take your questions, react live to all the big announcements, and show the chat a good time as we see what's next for the Nintendo Switch.

Trying to predict what will be at these Nintendo Directs is like trying to catch Togetic with a Lead Ball in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. While the publishing giant hasn't said what titles will make an appearance during the longer 40 minute direct, we can venture some guesses given what we know of the company's upcoming lineup. We know Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp fit within that timeframe, so it would make sense to get new looks at the exciting new Switch titles. 
Nintendo has also been steadily dropping new N64 games for Switch Online. A Direct would be a good time to continue that trend (here's hoping for Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Snap to celebrate the upcoming Pokémon Day on February 27). Will any of the games I listed in the first paragraph make an appearance? Probably not, or maybe yes? You'll just have to tune in live at 3:30 p.m. CT to find out. 
Thanks for watching with us, and we hope you enjoy the show! If you enjoy our live streams, be sure to head over to our Twitch channel, where you can throw us a subscription and be entered into our community Discord and stay up to the minute with Replay, Multiplayer Monday, and our Thursday gameplay streams!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a special livestream hosted by Geoff Keighly, The Wolf Among Us 2's first trailer premiered along with a release window of 2023. Keighly sat down with Telltale's designers and voice actors to spill the beans on what's in store for the long-awaited second season.

The Wolf Among Us 2 takes place six months after the first season, still well before the Fables comic series it's based on. Bigby Wolf (Adam Herrington) has been suspended from his role as sheriff of Fabletown by his new boss Snow White (Erin Yvette), who has become the deputy mayor overseeing a reformed administration. Cut loose and in anger management, Telltale says much of the tale revolves around Bigby having to discover his own definitions of good and evil as he meets a New York City detective and assists them on a difficult new case. Players can expect to bump into returning faces and newcomers, including characters from The Wizard of Oz, such as the Scarecrow and Tin Man. 
The game has been rebuilt in Unreal instead of Telltale's old gameplay engine. Telltale wouldn't divulge gameplay specifics, only saying it would be rooted in the foundation of season 1 with some new additions. The trailer primarily shows scenes from Episode 1, and The Wolf Among Us will consist of five episodes total. Telltale also confirmed the sequel is in full production after spending the last couple of years in the pre-planning phase. 
The Wolf Among Us 2 was first announced during The Game Awards 2019, though it had initially been in the works by the original Telltale Games before the studios' closure in 2018. The game was canceled after the shutdown but then restarted by the revived version of Telltale. You can learn the full story of how the new Telltale rose from the ashes of its predecessor by reading this deep-dive feature. 
You can play The Wolf Among Us 2 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Original story, 2/8/22:
Battlefield 2042 is still in the midst of a rough post-launch period. An abundance of game-breaking bugs and a lack of new content have disillusioned the franchise's long-time fans and turned off newcomers. Despite the game's ongoing issues, a dedicated player base does exist, but the activity numbers have waned since release. To make matters worse, a Battlefield 2042 refund p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months in, Halo Infinite has carved out a place in my regular gaming schedule. I had a lot to praise about the game in my original review, in which I wrote about the ways that this newest Halo nimbly walks the line between nostalgia for the earlier games and a fresh, modern core. I’ve been surprised that the multiplayer component has kept me so engaged for as many weeks as it has; as many have observed, the small number of map selections and modes can be limiting, but I still find myself coming back for more of that wonderful “dance” of competition that the Halo competitive experience offers in its best moments. Nonetheless, as the weeks wear on, the challenge system that sits on top of that competition feels deeply flawed, and the passage of time is only making the problems more app…]]></summary>

Thus began America's Army, a series of tactical first-person shooters funded and released for free by the Army as a recruitment tool. But the series has seemingly petered out and now they're preparing to end support for the latest, America's Army: Proving Grounds. Official servers will shut down in May, though offline bits and privately owned servers will remain playable.

Yesterday, we reported that Intellivision Entertainment's Tommy Tallarico had been replaced as CEO by chief revenue officer Phil Adam in order to "better align" company resources with "new challenges."
One of those new challenges may be keeping the company afloat, as an SEC filing shared on the firm's website earlier this week suggests that it has made no revenue since its resurrection in 2018 and may not be able to operate beyond July of this year (thanks, GI.biz).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is a mobile prequel to the 2018 RPG that launched in Japan in October 2020. It became wildly popular overseas and now Octopath fans in the west will have their chance to see why when the English version arrives this year.
Champions of the Continent plays similarly to the original title. The turn-based field command system remains but up to eight characters can take the battlefield instead of only four. Naturally, the game retains the original’s signature HD-2D art style. 
Story-wise, the game still takes place on the continent of Osterra. The narrative has three paths starring Herminia the "Witch of Greed", Tytos the "Hero", and Auguste the "Playwright". Each character is on a journey to find wealth, power, and glory, respectively, and whoever you choose acts as a Chosen One fighting against a great evil. Fans of the first Octopath Traveler can expect to bump into familiar faces from that game as well. 
OCTOPATH TRAVELER: Champions of the Continent (English ver.) will launch in North America and Europe in 2022!

February 8, 2022
Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is a free-to-play title with microtransactions; new characters are obtained using standard gacha-style mechanics. The game launches on iOS and Android in North America and Europe sometime in 2022 with a closed beta beginning in Spring. New information is expected to drop in “mid-February” on the game’s newly launched Facebook page. 
Until then, Octopath’s spiritual tactical follow-up Triangle Strategy is on the horizon, releasing on March 4.]]></summary>

Desktop monitors are trying it out as well, like the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX: the very first Mini LED gaming monitor on the market when it launched late last year. As a 32in, 4K, 144Hz display, it does all it can to welcome Mini LED into high-end gamingland, and from what I’ve tested it’s a brilliant match. All you have to do first is spend what could well be several times the cost of your PC itself.

We've not had to wait too long for the first major Nintendo Direct of 2022, which is rather lovely.

A few of our team have already had a pleasant little chat with some Nintendo Direct predictions - we covered some relatively obvious stuff, mulled over some of the numerous rumours that have done the rounds, and threw in some wildcard guesses for fun. Nintendo being what it is, we'll no doubt be pleasantly surprised and wrong about various things over the course of the show!

Tip of the iceberg. You haven’t seen his eagerness, his joie de vivre, as he swings between the many improbably-convenient floating grapple hook platforms of the world. You haven’t witnessed the plucky determination with which he clambers up wall after wall, no matter how many times he’s climbed them before. You haven’t admired his gumption as he bounces atop each polar bear head, or upon the still bouncier belly of every (unwilling) crab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. 
For example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.

From Software has revealed that the online servers for its Dark Souls suite of games on PC will remain offline until the launch of Elden Ring. 
Last month, From Software revealed that a PC exploit had been discovered in its suite of Dark Souls games that could give control of your PC over to someone else. That obviously presents a whole host of problems and From Software responded by taking the PC Dark Souls games – so Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 – offline. Now, you could still play the game solo, but the online components were taken offline and From Software has revealed that their servers will remain offline until after the release of Elden Ring later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Porting to Switch has been pretty fun and interesting".
We have plenty of beautiful platformers, narrative experiences and Metroidvania titles on Switch, but a genre that always needs more representation is dynamic puzzlers. Games that allow you to both explore and soak in a beautiful atmosphere while keeping your grey cells busy - Lumote: The Mastermote Chronicles could certainly help to fill that gap. Developed by Luninawesome Games and published by Wired Productions, it's heading to Switch (and a whole lot of other platforms) on 24th March, so there's not long to wait.
Having been well received in early access on Steam, the full game will arrive with additional content and adjustments based on fan feedback. What immediately stood out to us in a recent presentation was the art style and its fantastical sub-aquatic setting, with varied 'Motes' — essentially creatures with special abilities — that drive the puzzle solving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, it sure looks like more MLB The Show.
Sony San Diego has unveiled a flashy new gameplay trailer for MLB The Show 22, a series that'll be making its Switch debut this year. As you'd expect the footage is focused on PS5 / Xbox Series X|S versions, but you can get a sense for what the game is all about.
If you're a veteran of the series there isn't a huge amount that's new; as an annual release upgrades to visuals and animations are always very gradual in each entry. The trailer does reveal two new legends that'll be joining the game's online Diamond Dynasty mode, however - Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson and power hitter Ryan Howard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Investors love this stuff.
While the 'metaverse' - conventionally a network of virtual worlds often accessed through VR or AR - is a pretty old concept, for investors in big tech firms it's apparently a new, innovative one which is about to change our lives. As a result tech CEOs around the world can't say the term fast enough in their presentations and briefings. It's easy to be cynical, though the end result could — in theory — bring us some fun content in the future. The latest company planning to jump in is Bandai Namco, which has announced major investment in its own project.
In a presentation this week the company presented its 'IP Axis Strategy' (thanks, GamesIndustry.biz); the plan outlines a $130 million investment to drive engagement and growth for the company's brands.

Wedding cakes, like people, come in all shapes and sizes — some elaborate and ostentatious, others subtle and understated. But no matter how many tiers you've got or what colour the confection is when you cut into it, there has yet to be a cake baked that couldn't be improved with the addition of some Animal Crossing characters spiked on top.
As brought to our attention via a reddit post from user burritopalace, the custom handmade Animal Crossing cake toppers offered by Etsy seller LootreArt are so incredibly cute that they're almost worth getting married for.

Developer Sucker Punch Productions has announced that a new patch for its samurai action-adventure game, Ghost of Tsushima, brings with it a new armor set hidden on Iki Island. To the north of the game’s newest island, you’ll find a Wind Shrine with a puzzle for you to solve. Solve it and you’ll receive a new Aloy-inspired armor. 
We are so excited for Horizon Forbidden West from our friends at @Guerrilla! While we wait, today we’ve released a new patch for Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut that repairs a Wind Shrine to the north of Iki Island. Solve the puzzle there to earn an Aloy-inspired surprise... pic.twitter.com/5brcjTvL7o
February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, solving this new Iki Island Wind Shrine gives protagonist Jin Sakai an armor set that resembles something Aloy might wear in the Horizon games. That’s not all, though. This patch also brings a new Platinum difficulty option to the Survival mode in Ghost of Tsushima Legends, the multiplayer arm of the game. Plus, the patch fixes an issue that causes brief stuttering during gameplay. 
While waiting for this patch to download, be sure to read about everything that’s new in Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut and check out our breakdown of everything we already know about Horizon Forbidden West. Be sure to watch the latest Horizon Forbidden West trailer that showcases challenges, arenas, salvage contracts, and more after that.

It is a long tradition in JRPGs to have the main character attempt to kill the gods that rule over them, but very rarely does this happen in the opening moments of the game. This is the case for Maglam Lord, which has now landed in the West. In Maglam Lord, players take control of a demon lord with the excessively-metal name of Killzerk as they try to regain their powers and bring their species back from the brink of extinction.
The opening cutscene in this action-RPG shows Killzerk taking the fight to the immortal gods, only to fall back to Earth and take an extended power nap. When they awaken, the world is a very different place. Magic is no longer plentiful, and they are the last of their kind left in the world. The power that they once used to challenge the gods is quickly fading from them and can only be replenished by fighting monsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The International Game Developers Association has been an outspoken critic of the cultures at companies like Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard that has led to so many lawsuits, departures and firings over the last few years.

There's a lot to love about Bandai Namco in terms of the games it releases, but one thing that hasn't gone down so well is the company's logo refresh - originally revealed last October and scheduled to come into effect in April this year.
While the Japanese publisher responsible for series like PAC-MAN, Tekken and Tales is still going ahead with this makeover, it has now made one slight adjustment. As detailed in its latest mid-term plan (April 2022 - March 2025), the speech bubble outline has been changed from magenta to red.

Last week, I noticed my hand was sore. I didn't think much of it, mostly because I wasn't sure why it would be hurting. On Monday, while playing OlliOlli World, I found my reason. I'm not sure there's a better way to recommend World than that; it pushed my hands to their limit. 
Compared to the previous two OlliOlli games, which could be prohibitively difficult, World is simultaneously an easy-to-approach 2D skateboarding game with an impossibly high skill ceiling. Early on, the game does a great job quickly teaching you …]]></summary>

We love Digital Foundry's tech deep-dives as much as the next framerate obsessive, but when it comes to applying the scientific method to things in video games, we have to say that it's the mundane things that help us out the most. Like this extremely important video, for example!
The question is: Is it faster to roll, or to sprint, in Pokémon Legends: Arceus? The secret answer is that Wyrdeer is faster than both, so just hurry up and unlock the lad, but if you're on-foot, it turns out that your foots are exactly what you need.

Amazon Games, the publisher bringing Tripod Studios and Smilegate's RPG to the west, has been kind enough to let some of the press in a little early to play on a private server, so I've had my hands on the action-RPG MMO for a few weeks now. Much of the game was in place when I played, although I was missing a very big aspect of it: the broader social component. Because of the small sample size of players, all of my time in the world of Arkesia was by my lonesome. So, for now, I'm not comfortable dropping my final assessment on Lost Ark. Instead, here are some of my thoughts on this impressive free-to-play title after playing pre-release.

Mastering a martial art takes years – if not a lifetime. Disciples must hone their bodies to the point that they perform every attack, every counter, every movement with pinpoint precision. A skilled warrior must move without thinking. Likewise, mastering Sifu's combat system takes a high degree of dedication and practice. Like a true martial artist, you must push through the practice pains before you reap any rewards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear that have not been formally announced (Tyler Bate would be lonely without his Mustache Mountain partner, Trent Seven, after all). We’ll update this list as new wrestlers are announced, but here’s how the roster is shaping up so far:
AJ Styles
Damien Priest
Kane
Sami Zayn
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.
WWE 2K22 launches March 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

“Unfolding a story born from loss, the newly released launch trailer finally reveals the violent spark that has laid the path for a fiery journey, fueled by anger and devastation,” a press release for Sifu reads. “Introducing the five main enemies you will seek out in your quest for redemption, today’s trailer showcases a jolting array of authentic Pak Mei Kung Fu action as the main character, which players can play as male or female, slides through a variety of enemies with skillful, mindful combat.”

What if Gone Home was about a murder? And what if you, a sort of sci-fi Sherlock Holmes, able to investigate a crime scene using revolutionary nano-tech, were able to figure out what happened? That's the idea behind Forest Grove, an upcoming narrative puzzle-thriller that's all about reconstructing the truth.
An heiress goes missing, and foul play is suspected. The Remote Forensics Bureau is called in, and they recreate the lavish estate of the Kunstimatigaard family using their new Nanodeck technology to clone the whole thing, allowing investigators to explore the house, collect evidence, and watch reconstructions of the various scenes that led up to the disappearance of Zooey Kunstimatigaard, the teen heiress to her dead parents' fortune.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go is celebrating Valentine's Day in a couple of different ways. From February 10 through 14, you'll have the chance to engage in new events and catch Flabébé for the first time.
This fairy-type Pokémon rides atop a flower and can evolve twice. If you feed it 25 candies, it will transform into Floette. Offer up another 100 candies and it'll become Florges, but only after you earn 20 hearts with it as a buddy. Flabébé is from Generation VI and is number 669 on the Pokédex.
During the event, you'll also be able to evolve Furfrou in a new way. If you feed it 25 candies and 10,000 stardust, you can select the Heart Trip to give it a festive Valentine's Day design.
Along with the Pokémon of note, you'll also find the usual suspects out in the wild. This list includes Luvdisc, Chansey, Plusle, Minun, Miltank, Audino, Alomomola, Woobat, Volbeat, and Illumise. All of them have shiny variants, too. Registeel will be the only Pokémon in five-star raids, with Mega Houndoom being the lone Mega Raid.
Spinda is returning to field research tasks, this time rocking a heart pattern. Spinda can also be shiny.
Good luck on the hunt, trainers!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 hit consoles and PC just last week, launching to record numbers for Techland’s zombie parkour franchise. Now, a week later, Eurogamer’s Poland-based site, Eurogamer.pl, has discovered a weapon in Dying Light 2 that appears to be a reference to CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077. A lead designer on Dying Light 2 seems to have confirmed it, too. 
Tak, to oficjalne 🇵🇱❤️ https://t.co/dKPzHvPpop
February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the weapon in Dying Light 2 looks a lot like Cyberpunk 2077’s Mantis Blade weapon, which is less a weapon you hold but one you install directly into your arm. It’s quite metal, literally. 
Now, you might be wondering why Dying Light 2 would reference the critically-maligned Cyberpunk 2077 – sure, both are open-world RPGs based sometime in the future. However, the real connection here is that both Techland and CD Projekt Red are based in Poland. It’s not hard to imagine that Techland wanted to shout out a fellow Poland-based developer in the form of a reference like this. 
Plus, it’s just plain cool. Who doesn’t want blades for arms? As for finding this weapon in Dying Light 2, Eurogamer.pl writes that it can be found on the roof of a building somewhere in the city of Villedor. It’s a scheme you pick up, which you can then use to craft into a weapon. 
For more about Dying Light 2, read Game Informer’s Dying Light 2 review and then check out Techland’s post-launch roadmap that includes five years of DLC. Read Game Informer’s Cyberpunk 2077 review after that.

Now, you might be wondering why Dying Light 2 would reference the critically-maligned Cyberpunk 2077 – sure, both are open-world RPGs based sometime in the future. However, the real connection here is that both Techland and CD Projekt Red are based in Poland. It’s not hard to imagine that Techland wanted to shout out a fellow Poland-based developer in the form of a reference like this. 
Plus, it’s just plain cool. Who doesn’t want blades for arms? As for finding this weapon in Dying Light 2, Eurogamer.pl writes that it can be found on the roof of a building somewhere in the city of Villedor. It’s a scheme you pick up, which you can then use to craft into a weapon. 
For more about Dying Light 2, read Game Informer’s Dying Light 2 review and then check out Techland’s post-launch roadmap that includes five years of DLC. Read Game Informer’s Cyberpunk 2077 review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scalebound was once one of the hottest Microsoft exclusives during the Xbox One’s early years. Developed by Platinum Games, the stylish action title combined Devil May Cry-style action and attitude with dragons. Despite the hype, the game was canceled in 2017 and has become one of gaming's curious “What if?” stories. Platinum's leadership is still interested in the idea, however, and wants to sit down with Microsoft to make it happen. 
In an interview with IGN Japan, Platinum’s president and vice president, Atsushi Inaba and Hideki Kamiya, respectively, reflected on Scalebound’s cancellation. Inaba states that Kamiya, the game’s creator, talks about reviving Scalebound “all the time.” This isn’t just wishful thinking; the pair wants to have serious talks with Microsoft about revisiting the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tom Holland is best known for taking on the role of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with Captain America: Civil War way back in 2016. Since then, he’s gone on to star as Spider-Man in multiple films, but for now, he’s put aside the web slingers and increased the amount of “craps” in his vocabulary to play Nathan Drake in Sony’s upcoming Uncharted movie. 
In an interview for the Uncharted movie, Holland was asked by GameSpot what his dream video game adaptation is, and his response was … interesting, to say the least. 
Hey, @A24 and @Naughty_Dog. Tom Holland has a great video game adaptation pitch for you guys. pic.twitter.com/QKKbJYWedf
February 4, 2022
This sounds great, as long as Toni Collette and Alex Wolff are on the cast list.
There’s no telling if Holland is serious, but if he is, we’d love to see what this movie would look like. A live-action Jak and Daxter movie is already pretty wild. Making it a “weird” and “dark” A24 movie? It sounds like this would adapt the sequel or the threequel rather than the Precursor Legacy. Maybe add in a touch of horror, and we’re sold. 
While waiting for this hypothetical Jak and Daxter movie, check out this official trailer for Holland’s Uncharted movie and then watch this trailer that reveals Sully’s signature mustache.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking as a generally terrified person who curls up into a tiny ball whenever they feel threatened, the tower defence genre really resonates with me. Like a besieged castle, I am also in a state of constant high-alert and paralysing, teeth-grinding stress. I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. 


Diplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your medieval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top.

Over the weekend, the former Irrational developer who placed the meme-ified Baguette Boy in Binfinite's Burial At Sea expansion explained why he's there. It's an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lego set you are about to see is a big SPOILER for people who haven't watched the second season of The Mandalorian. Read on at your own risk. This set is based on a moment that you should first see in the show.
Lucasfilm has done a fantastic job of keeping secrets under wraps for all of its Disney+ Star Wars shows. The Book of Boba Fett continues to deliver them in its first season, but none have been as big or as unexpected as Luke Skywalker's appearance in The Mandalorian. It's a moment that set the internet on fire, and has filled Star Wars fans with the belief that anything can happen in these shows.
Once a secret character is revealed, toy manufactuers race to get product of that certain someone on shelves. We saw it happen with Grogu, and now the floodgates are opened to create product for Luke Skywalker's big moment.
Lego is one of the first toy companies to capture Luke Skywalker showing us how powerful he has become. The set is called Dark Trooper Attack, and it's scheduled to release on March 1. Along with a hooded Luke Skywalker minifigure, this set comes with three Dark Troopers and is set in a hallway where chaos unfolds. It's a smaller set, consisting of just 166 pieces and a price of $29.99.

We know The Mandalorian will be a part of the forthcoming Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga game, but we'll have to wait to see if this particular moment is recreated and gives fans control of Luke in arguably one of his greatest moments.]]></summary>

Committing to the player numbers game of a free-to-play model for its South Korean launch back in 2019, Lost Ark always needed to perform on low-end and luxury PCs alike, and its imminent Western release is following the same rules. The result: a game that rarely looks outstanding but always runs smoothly, whether it’s on older budget hardware or the best graphics cards and CPUs of today.

The battle for the Light against Savathûn and her Lucent Brood is fast approaching in Destiny 2’s newest expansion, The Witch Queen, pitting Guardians against their Hive counterparts who share similar powers to our own. In a recent event, we watched some never-before-seen gameplay set on Savathûn’s Throne World, one of the main locations for The Witch Queen. We were also offered a glimpse at a versatile new weapon called the Glaive as well as a tour of what crafting our very own weapons will look like.

That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. 
I’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn't obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced that a new Nintendo Direct is happening this week, and you won't have to wait too much longer. 
That's because this Direct is happening tomorrow, February 9, at 2 p.m. PT/4 p.m. CT/5 p.m. ET. As for what to expect, Nintendo didn't name any game titles, but there's some straightforward extrapolation to be done. 
Tune in 2/9 at 2 p.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mainly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2022.

February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the Direct will run for 40 minutes. Plus, most of what's shown will be games released on the Switch in the first half of 2022. That means we'll likely be seeing Chocobo GP and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
Of course, there's a Breath of the Wild-sized elephant in the room to address – the highly-anticipated sequel doesn't seem like a game coming in the first half of this year. However, Nintendo says the Direct is "mainly focused" on games coming in these first six months. "Mainly focused" gives Nintendo just enough room to discuss games releasing outside of that window, a la (probably) the sequel to Breath of the Wild. Can we at least get an official title, Nintendo?
Perhaps we'll see more of Bayonetta 3, or maybe even another look at Splatoon 3? Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because the direct is just over 24 hours away. 
What games do you hope to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar, 2K and others, released its own results today and to nobody’s surprise, Grand Theft Auto V is still selling really well. 
You might be asking who doesn’t already own GTA V? The answer is millions. Last November, Game Informer reported that GTA V had sold 5 million copies that quarter, bringing the total up to 155 million units overall. In Take-Two’s latest results, the publisher revealed that Rockstar’s GTA V has now sold 160 million units, representing another quarter where the game sold 5 million copies.

The pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.

We dream up ways that Captain Boomerang, Harley Quinn, King Shark, and Deadshot could take down some of the universe's most powerful heroes.
We also breakdown last week's top books, hopefully giving you some new reading material. And also dive into the past for a couple of legacy comic series that all comic readers should have knowledge of. As always, we end the show by discussing the comics that are coming out this week.

The solid turn-based combat, an ever-growing roster of beloved Marvel heroes and villains, and compelling hero-collecting elements borrowed from games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes drew me in from the jump. I couldn't wait to get the launch version on my phone.

And though it’s landing at an unusually busy time for game releases, this follow-up title is at the top of many fans’ most anticipated lists. Horizon Forbidden West appeared on our magazine cover in December, meaning we learned a ton of details about the game. So, there’s a lot to pack into this beefy round-up of everything you need to know before you start Aloy’s next journey. Let’s dive in.

Tallarico will remain with Intellivision, transitioning to the role of company president. He is also the company's largest shareholder. Chief revenue officer Phil Adam will replace him as CEO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale Games went through a resurrection and reinvention after its shutdown in 2018, but returned shortly after with a return to one of its fan-favorite series in 2019: The Wolf Among Us 2. We learned more about the game in December of 2020 and then Telltale Games shared some more a year later, shortly after Game Informer’s feature about this new iteration of the studio, its Wolf Among Us sequel, and its upcoming game based on The Expanse went live. 
If you’re still craving some more information about The Wolf Among Us 2, then you’re in luck because Telltale Games has some more information to share this week. More specifically, the studio has announced a behind-the-scenes look at the game happening this Wednesday, February 9, at 10 a.m. PT/Noon CT/1 p.m. EST. 
Greetings from Fabletown!
#TWAU2 + more, hosted by @geoffkeighley.

February 7, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, we’re all heading back to Fabletown this week. However, it doesn’t sound like we’ll be getting a trailer for the game or a look at gameplay. Considering Telltale Games used the words “behind-the-scenes” specifically, we expect just that – a look at what’s happening under the hood, maybe some concept art, and more. Only time will tell, though. 
While waiting for Wednesday, check out Game Informer’s The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1 review and then watch this Wolf Among Us 2 trailer. Read about Telltale Games’ upcoming series based on The Expanse after that. 
Are you excited for a behind-the-scenes look at The Wolf Among Us 2? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death's Door is a great little game. I've been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there's only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.

After a sequel, the team began work on GhostWire Tokyo, which is set to debut on PlayStation 5 and PC on March 25. 
While Mikami’s mind is probably mostly focused on the yokai-filled streets of Tokyo, that didn’t stop him from reminiscing about his most well-known horror series, Resident Evil. In a new interview with Newsweek, Mikami explained that he believes there’s ways Resident Evil 4 could be improved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released less than two weeks ago but it’s already a hit. Not only did it review really well – Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out of 10 – but it sold a massive 6.5 million copies in just seven days. A new mystery gift distribution might get more players excited to jump back into the Hisui region, or it might get those on the fence to finally pick up the game. 
News of this incoming mystery gift distribution event comes by way of Serebii.net, which spotted signage for the event. Serebii notes that the event seems to be exclusive to GameStop and will run from February 25 through March 13. It will give players a Hisuian Growlithe and 20 Feather Balls.

Now, as some have pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t necessarily the most exciting mystery gift distribution. A Hisuian Growlithe isn’t exactly rare – although for some, finding one could take hours – and 20 Feather Balls won’t cost you too much in-game. However, it doesn’t hurt to receive a free Pokémon and some useful Feather Balls. 
No further details have been released for the event just yet, but considering there’s still a few weeks before its start, it’s not surprising. As we near the February 25 start date for the mystery gift distribution event, expect more details about it to be revealed. 
While waiting for more information, be sure to read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then check out these three new Pokémon Pop! figures recently revealed. Read Game Informer’s 10 tips and tricks to know before starting Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.

I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.

Well, with Sifu, my childhood dream is now a reality. You don’t need to be a kung fu film fanatic to appreciate this action game, though. It’s not a tired bundle of tropes packaged together with an ironic detachment. It’s a passionate celebration of what makes the genre so good. It looks at the classics, then the modern descendants of that style, and finally puts its own unique twist on the whole thing.

My new favourite is Worldle. It meets all the criteria, including being free and playable in your browser, but instead of guessing a word you're attempt to identify a country by its silhouette.

Then, almost after the real trailer was finished, there was a minute or more of the actual game, as a character gathered herbs in a pretty field at night, mixed a drink, and unlocked some items. 

I was immediately focused back in. Update 2.5, "When the Sakura Bloom", will launch on February 16th with three new characters.

But then heck, I like the game and I've only bought a handful of content packs because I liked the look of the kitchen cupboards. So play The Sims 4 for free on Steam this weekend, and buy it at 88% off if you like it.

The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

Well, Agent 47 clearly needs to make the next stop on his international mission list a nice, relaxing retreat on the Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar. Not to murder anyone, of course. But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She's a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she's not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she's running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she's doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I've ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

For eight years they've focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they'll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

This week it's the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that's making things difficult. You're the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It's sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I'm a little bit annoyed that I like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!
It reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.

Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.


The first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.

He's one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio's classic RPG Nox? That's Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he's currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.
A streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons & Dragons, Demeo won a lot of "best of" accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it's coming to regular ol' PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you become a game designer, you are handed a big book of antagonists to use as guilt-free bullet fodder. First among them is the reliable, stinky zombie. (Also found in this repertoire are Nazis and Slimes. They are beyond the scope of this listicle.) The zombie is a preternaturally killable being. It has already experienced mortality once, so this creature more than anyone is ready to suffer the ignominy of death. It has practice, it knows what's coming. Being a zombie is like having two degrees. You're extra qualified, and you probably groan a lot.
Here's a list of the best zombies in PC games.

You swat away hordes of monsters with weapons and magic that fire automatically. All it needs from you is one hand on the wheel. You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.
Not only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle. The perfect after-school treat. A nerdy talk generator for those locker chats.

This doesn't just mean things from fighting games, although they do obviously make a good showing. As you can imagine, Nate makes the case for RTS games with what he and his pals term 'the GG push'. Plus, we have a great Mortal Kombat themed Cavern Of Lies this week, courtesy of Matthew.
Much time is spent on some excellent digressions this week, including James McAvoy as a rampaging dinosaur from Jurassic Park (a state of affairs that I think would have improved his weird improv film My Son). Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all? Will someone make a game like Deep Rock Galactic, but for mining Matthew's celestial bum-meat? A whimsical episode this week indeed.

Bungie have said things will continue as normal on all platforms. But beyond the usual issues with consolidation and platformholders buying studios, the concerns I have for Destiny 2's future stem from the same old source: Bungie's own decisions. The grind needs to end.

This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB.

Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it's the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game's textures and models with high-def versions, they've tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.

I'll be honest, I've been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. "Look how much emotion their faces show now!" was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.

For every aspect of worldbuilding that I enjoyed, there was a bug that had to be overlooked. For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath. At least, until the game (as far as I can tell) bugged so badly that I literally couldn’t continue.

I am usually catastrophically bad at these games, as I lack the sheer nerve to commit all my assets to something at once, or take out loans to cover a product run, even in a fictional digital setting. Still, I was drawn to Startup Panic like a moth to a flame, and giggled to myself at the prospect of cosplaying as a Silicon Valley nerd trying to reinvent having a chicken coop. I called my founder Beth, and the company was therefore Betherium. But it turned out that the product I was tasked with making and selling was, basically, Facebook.

The New York Times, a hardcopy blog, are buying the viral hit word puzzle game for "an undisclosed price in the low-seven figures." They say it will be free when it moves under their banner, though it's not clear if it will stay that way.

A small sum, perhaps, in the face of the $69 billion Microsoft are currently shelling out for Activision Blizzard, but rather than simply subsuming the Destiny developer into the PlayStation mothership, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan has said that Bungie will "remain an independent and multi-platform studio and publisher."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Code Force's recent demonstration, I was optimistic about the upcoming space 4X/simulation/strategy/forward slash game Distant Worlds 2. The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).
Code Force have since sent us a preview build, and I've been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I'm struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it's had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I'm hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.

Possibly three (3) if you consider that man is the real monster. Or four (4) if you hate libraries.

Good news, then, for frequent flyers who happen to own an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card: Flight Sim is getting DLSS support this year.


Specifically, DLSS will be available when running the sim in DirectX 12, as part of a handful of upcoming DX12 enhancements that also include optimisations for playing on multiple monitors. Developers Asobo Studio confirmed the DLSS addition in a recent devstream, which you can watch in full below, though the feature is still being tested so there’s no specific date beyond 2022.

Hopefully this means we'll hear more about efforts to complete the remake, but I guess they could also be talking about merch or new movies.

The electronic twinkle of health-restoring chicken, which sounds uncannily like the shield’s up sound from 1999 classic 3D Astro Blaster. The ‘boo boo de boo, boo boo de boop’ of the chest-opening jingle, to which my shoulders cannot help but shimmy. Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. 
Vampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically. You can (and should) play it with one hand while eating a bag of crisps. It’s a very good way to spend £2.

And not just with the expectation of being good GPUs, but with the hope that they can fix one of the biggest vexations in PC gaming: a years-long component shortage that’s made all of the best graphics cards nearly impossible to buy at fair prices.


Intel graphics chief Raja Koduri is at least well aware of the pressure, tweeting that the company is “working hard to find a path towards the mission - getting millions of Arc GPUs into the hands of PC gamers every year.” Koduri was responding to an open letter from our friends at PC Gamer, calling on Intel to finally toss an escape rope down the hardware hellmouth we’ve all found ourselves trapped in. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also responded, claiming “We’re on it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend I am looping the Assault On Precinct 13 theme to build the plodding determination I will need to survive the impending NFT bonanza. I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I'll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).
But the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?

The games I've collected this week for the first TFI Friday of the year are going to ease us gently out of the time loop that we've been stuck in the last umpteen months. Accordingly, the first one is a time loop puzzle game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I'm currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn't be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call 'cute' NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer "BOY!" Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War's other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he's doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and "I know you are, but what am I?" nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

I'm pretty bad at them as well, which doesn't help. Mostly though, I became jaded and curmudgeonly at around nine years old, and will never know such naive wonder again.
Still, Hyper Echelon is fun.

It's a statement I have only briefly put to the test during a rushed weeked in San Antonio, a trip I mostly remember for 1) seeing a roadside billboard that advertised Jesus on one side and massive tits on the other, and 2) making a joke about having a puffy taco "so I guess I should see a doctor!" [finger guns] that fell bone-chillingly flat to a dinner table of American business colleagues.
You know where everything actually is bigger? The past. Join us on this special supporter-funded bonus podcast episode where Nate is our gentle and enthusiastic guide for really massive historical monsters. A giant owl? Bigfoot is really an orangutan? A huge fish that might in fact just be well big, owing to a mistake with its skeleton? Yes, we have all these delights and more. A big thank you to our supporters for making The Nate Files happen.

This is a situation Riot Games found themselves in after a lighthearted tweet about one of the Valorant wizards visiting an art exhibition on a day out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anecdotally, the first records of modern golf date back to its banning in 15th century Scotland. “Nay Golf,” said parliament. “It’s turning the soldiers into fiendish, turf-snorting club-strokers who’d rather say shit like ‘Triple Bogey’ than batter the English, and we’re no having it.” RPGolf Legends is not set in 15th century Scotland, but it does take place in a world where golf has been banned. Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. 
I say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.

This month, we're travelling back to rescue eight games from 2010, and cor, what a good year that was. Too bad almost all of them will end up in the lava bin by the time we're done.
