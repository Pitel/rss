The January 2023 release date of HBO's highly anticipated The Last of Us series is quickly approaching, which means we're getting more glimpses of the show ahead of its debut than ever before. The most recent unveiling was a series of posters featuring the series' most prominent side characters, which HBO posted as a thread to the official HBO Last of Us Twitter account. There are five in total, featuring Bill (Nick Offerman), Frank (Murray Bartlett), Sarah (Nico Parker), Riley (Storm Reid), and Henry (Lamar Johnson).
This new series of posters follow those featuring the series' main cast, including Joel (Pedro Pascal), Ellie (Bella Ramsey), Tommy (Gabriel Luna), Tess (Anna Torv), and Marlene (Merle Dandridge). Each character also has a specific role assigned to them al…]]></summary>

So if you've been playing since launch, you've likely already reached the ending of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
Our reviews for the new Pokemon games went live yesterday. But seeing as it's difficult to talk about something so spoiler-laden in a review, we wanted to specifically talk about the ending.

Harvestella wants to be a jack of two trades, but winds up a master of none. Part action-RPG, part farming/life simulation, this combination can sometimes be enjoyable, but the two styles clash more often than not. The result is a sluggish grind more likely to repel fans of each genre than bring them together.
As an amnesiac warrior, you awaken on the outskirts of a quaint village, unaware of your origin and purpose. Four powerful, monolithic crystals called Seaslight govern the environmental stability of the picturesque continent, namely its seasons. However, a …]]></summary>

Anyone who was within a hundred-mile radius of the video game industry from 2018-2020 was no stranger to battle royale modes. Suddenly titles like Fortnite and PUBG were some of the biggest games in the world, and it seemed like every franchise wanted a piece of the pie. We had Call of Duty enter the mix with Warzone, the character-focused Apex Legends, and we even got a battle royale mode for Tetris. Tetris! 
It feels like we're finally growing tired of the mode these days (or at the very least, the release of new battle royale-themed modes have slowed down significantly), and it leaves me wondering, which hot new mode will take over as the trendsetting game type?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rev up those speculations and rumors
The end of the year is rapidly approaching and so, too, are The Game Awards. The multi-hour awards show is likely set to have a fair few reveals in store. And it looks like Naoki Yoshida of Square Enix will be in attendance at The Game Awards 2022.
The official TGAs account announced today that Naoki Yoshida will be at this year's event, with a special presentation in store. No further details were given, but that sure does sound like something being unveiled.
https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1597998900471701504
Yoshida has garnered acclaim as one of the key figures behind Final Fantasy XIV. He's also the producer of upcoming RPG Final Fantasy XVI. Given The Game Awards account is singling that out, XVI seems like the most likely reason to appear.
Finally, fantasy
We did get a trailer drop for Final Fantasy XVI in October, showing off some of the action and adventure in store for this new entry in Square's long-running RPG series. It's currently aimed for summer 2023, so a date might not be out of question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih0fVVtmiB4
 
Whatever the case, it does seem like the next Final Fantasy is nearing closer and closer. Little tidbits and signs like ratings seem to indicate Square Enix is setting up the runway. This will be the first new Final Fantasy since 2016's brotastic road trip Final Fantasy XV, so there are some expectations and hopes in store that have possibly wavered a bit over the last few months.
Either way, chalk that up for another potential world premiere for The Game Awards 2022. The show airs on December 8, with the livestream kicking off at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET.

I consider the N64 to be my main stomping ground, which is no small claim. Although I recognize the considerable drawbacks of both the hardware and the era in which it was spawned, I love it all the same. I suppose the fact that it’s a contrasting mix of good and bad is really the cause of my attraction. The PS1 is too good. The Saturn is too lacking. But the N64 is like fine art played on a vaseline-smeared screen.
It had some great titles, though. While I’ve picked my top 5, and I’m confident in my picks, I’m leaving out a number of titles that I could gush about. That’s sort of why I don’t like lists like this, I’d rather talk in-depth about the merits and problems of each game in their own context, not compare them.

The new token system is in and some small quality-of-life changes have been added. Good stuff! But when players opened the store after the patch they saw a big ol’ banner for a new $100 bundle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty remains the Golden Goose
Microsoft continues in its dogged efforts to seek approval from European antitrust regulators over its purchase of Activision Blizzard. The deal, which was announced almost a full year ago, would see Microsoft take ownership of the video game publisher for the hefty sum of $68.7 billion USD.
Before the deal can be completed, Microsoft must seek the approval of various global commissions, ensuring that there will be no antitrust issues from the meeting of two of the industry's biggest companies. The European Commission is yet to offer its approval for the purchase, going as far as to launch a full investigation into the proposed deal. The commission is charged with declaring its decision before April 11, 2023.

At the center of myriad angles on this whole endeavor lies Activision's billion-dollar franchise, Call of Duty. Sony has been unashamedly loud in its concerns that making the military shooter franchise an Xbox exclusive will severely harm the PlayStation market. And while Microsoft had offered up an agreement to keep Call of Duty a cross-platform release for "at least three years", Sony rejected this offer, with CEO Jim Ryan openly calling it "inadequate on many levels".
According to world news outlet Reuters, Microsoft might be preparing to make Call of Duty the ace in securing global approval for the Activision purchase. Reuters suggests that MS might offer Sony a 10-year licensing — a good-faith gesture intended to sway antitrust concerns. Regardless, there is still some way to go, as while the purchase has been unconditionally cleared in many territories — including Brazil, Serbia, and Saudi Arabia — The EU Commission and U.S. FTC regulators will take more convincing.

        <updated>2022-11-30T19:00:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's more headed to the Frontiers
Sega has outlined the 2023 content road map ahead for Sonic Frontiers. New playable characters, a photo mode, challenges, and more are all in store for Sonic Frontiers in 2023.
The DLC roadmap was laid out today on the Sonic social accounts. Three big updates are planned for 2023, and they're set to be free for all Sonic Frontiers owners. The content and names of said content are subject to change, Sega notes.
Update 1 will consist of a juke box for all those excellent tunes, as well as a photo mode. So yes, you'll be able to take some Sonic Selfies. Those two pieces are joined by new challenge modes to tackle, which may include the golden Super Sonic.

In Update 2, it's Sonic's birthday! Plus, an Open Zone Challenge and new Koco. I am definitely curious to see what a Sonic birthday party looks like.
Then, the heavy hitters arrive in Update 3. Playable characters and new story are both due out in Update 3, and it looks like a doozy. We have a teaser of the Frontiers villain, as well as portraits for Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. The implication seems to be that the Sonic crew will be playable in some way, but we'll doubtless learn more in the new year.
Now it's a party
How those different characters, who often have pretty distinct playstyles from Sonic, will fit into the world of Sonic Frontiers will be interesting to see if that's how it pans out. Knuckles and Amy can definitely handle some combat, and flying around as Tails in a big, open space could be fun.
We'll find out more of what's in store as we get closer to the launch of these new updates. In the meantime, Sonic Frontiers is still a fairly fresh game, so this might be the sign for holdouts to try it out if they want to check out all the extra content later.

Microsoft has revealed the two titles headed to its Xbox Games with Gold subscribers in December, and its a double-dose of 2D action with the coming of Headup Games' rootin' tootin' Colt Canyon and PM Studios' hackin' 'n' slashin' Bladed Fury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ9NyWZjKhw
Developed by Retrific and released in the summer of 2020, Colt Canyon is a challenging roguelike shooter which charges the player with picking one of a number of gunslingers before heading out into the wicky-wicky-wild-wild-west on a quest to rescue their captive partner. What follows is some fast-paced and extremely twitchy eight-way shooter action, set against some nostalgic 8-bit pixel visuals.

Everyone plays video games for different reasons. For some, it’s stress relief. For others, it’s community. I can’t pin my own tastes down, but I do know that if a game made me cry, I probably liked it a lot.
To me, video games have unique opportunities to tug at the heart strings. It is wonderful to learn about a world and its characters for 20, 50, or even 100 hours. If done right, a game can use this space to tell evocative stories that wouldn’t work in other media. As I was making this list, I realized that so many games have succeeded this way that I had a hard time pinning down just five.

As the saying goes, war never changes, but this is only partly true of the Front Mission series, which puts players in control of a group of wanzer pilots as they try to outmanoeuvre the opposing side. The first game in the series has seen a whole host of remakes and releases, with the latest, Front Mission 1st: Remake, landing on Nintendo Switch. It brings all the drama and fantastic storytelling that have become the hallmarks of the series along with a modern look and sound for current audiences.
The plot of Front Mission 1st: Remake follows the conflict between two coalitions of nations. The OCU, which represents nations in the South Asian, South East Asian, and Australian regions, and the USN, which represents the North and South American continents, are locked in an ongoing cold war. Each wants control of Huffman Island and has sent their wanzer forces to shift the balance of power on the island in their favour.

Today, the official TGA Twitter account added fuel to that fire by revealing that FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, who we interviewed about the game earlier this summer, will be a presenter at the show this year. Plus, he's being welcomed to give "a very special live presentation." What that means remains unknown, but all signs point to something to do with FFXVI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not quite extinct
Songs, drama, and fond memories are all flooding back for one indie narrative game. Goodbye Volcano High has resurfaced with a trailer and a launch window.
The dino teen drama got some notice when it took the stage during a PlayStation showcase in 2020. The project's been in development since, with the release window shifting in the meantime. Now, Goodbye Volcano High is aiming for a summer 2023 launch.
Alongside the news today is a trailer, showing off some of what's in store for the prehistoric school year. While the art direction is an immediate draw for some, today's trailer also spotlights gameplay from KO_OP's story.

There's dialogue options, which will likely have some ramifications down the line for Fang, the lead. Or maybe jamming to music's more your style, or taking photos. When the cataclysm is nigh, what should you do with your time?
Meteoric rise
That's the crux of Goodbye Volcano High: the world is ending, an era is being put to a close. So what do you do with the time remaining? It's a bit heavy, for sure.
But as someone who hadn't been sold on the concept just yet, today's trailer has honestly won me over a bit. The music is fantastic, and all the style added to dialogue, rhythm, and other segments give Goodbye Volcano High a bit of added flair. I've seen some narrative games do impressive things with how they stylize basic chats and conversations.
If making the most of life's little dramas before imminent doom sounds up your alley, Goodbye Volcano High is aiming for a summer 2023 launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's still officially due out by the end of the year
Valheim, which exploded at launch, is still going strong; and the game is about to host its Mistlands update before 2022 closes out. Thanks to a new blog post we have a better idea of what it's going to entail, and it seems like a lot of changes are on the way.
Boasting the typical quality of life features and fixes, we're also getting:
Nine new creatures + a boss
20+ crafting materials
15 new food items
More craftable items and furniture
A "new type of dungeon"
New lore stones, dreams, and music
A fishing update is also planned as part of the update, as well as more emotes, hairstyles, and beard styles. There's a full spoiler reveal option on the aforementioned blog post at the very bottom: if you want to get into the nitty gritty as an active player. You can also try all this out yourself...now!
Here's how to try out the Valheim Mistlands update now
Go to Steam, right-click the game, and hit properties
Under the beta section, enter "yesimadebackups" (without the quotes) and click the option that appears
That's it! You can try it out in public test form, and there's more official instructions here if you're running into issues.
Here's another very important note about the upcoming content from a test perspective:
"An important thing to note is that the Mistlands biome will only generate in areas you have not yet discovered. Therefore, if you have explored a lot of your world, you might be better off starting a new one in order to actually be able to travel to the Mistlands. As per usual, mods will also most likely cause the game not to launch, as they are only compatible with the Live version of the game. If you have mods, you will either need to remove them or wait for the mod to be updated before you can play."

Understandably given the name, there were not games for the developers kit outside of a few incredibly basic demos. But there was Half-Life 2, for which Valve had implemented a hacky VR mode that you could activate with some console tomfoolery.

In my review, I praised many elements of Sonic Team's first "open-zone" attempt, but my main takeaway was, "I can’t wait to see how Sonic Team iterates on this formula in future entries." While those future entries are likely years away, the developer today gave us a glimpse into how it plans to expand Sonic Frontiers throughout 2023 through a content roadmap.
The Sonic Frontiers 2023 content shows off a series of future content updates to the game. The three updates will roll out to players of Sonic Frontiers over the course of 2023 at no additional cost. While no timeline is given, it's probably safe to assume that Update 2 will hit so…]]></summary>

There are actually two links to Mirage, because this final chapter features *more* of its protagonist, Basim, who Valhalla persevere-ers will have already met. I bailed after 15 hours and so have very little idea what's going on, which is a shame because I'd love a chinwag with Shohreh Aghdashloo.

Grab your batarangs, cattle prods, and... erm... magical stun bullets, as Warner Bros Montreal has released a new update for its DC Comics-inspired adventure, Gotham Knights — Now available for free on all platforms, the Heroic Assault content drop adds new co-op action for our caped vigilante force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX22XjOJ9-k
The new update consists of two all-new standalone gameplay modes, both focusing on multiplayer mayhem for heroes Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and The Red Hood. The first mode "Heroic Assault", is a tower-climbing survival challenge, and allows up to four players to pick their way through 30 floors of increasingly dangerous enemies and boss battles. Should your squad reach the top of the tower, they will face not only the human hybrid Man-Bat, but, somewhat surprisingly, they will also have to tackle the alien lifeform Starro the Conquerer!
The second mode, "Showdown" will allow one of two players to take on supercharged versions of the main boss battles from Gotham Knights' story mode, such as Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, and Talia Al Ghul. As players defeat each megavillain, they will be rewarded with brand new in-game goodies, including legendary gear blueprints and unique colors for character suits and Batcycles. Both Heroic Assault and Showdown are made available once each competing player has defeated Gotham Knights' rogues' galley.
Gotham Knights is now available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Bandai Namco has released a brand new trailer for its upcoming RPG, Tales of Symphonia Remastered, due for launch on February 17th, 2023.
Focusing on the story, the new trailer showcases Lloyd Irving and a bunch of his friends against a backdrop of very dramatic music. Nice. The original game first launched for the GameCube back in 2003 to positive critical reception and strong sales. A sequel, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World, launched on the Wii a few years later in 2008.

If you played Mega Man X4 sight unseen, the cutscenes will stay with you forever. Like a few of Mega Man 8's anime story videos, this is a collection of some of the wackiest scenes and voice acting in video game history, and that infamy spread far and wide among the Mega Man community. Now, Capcom is leaning into it, like many other brands (Sonic Twitter immediately comes to mind). Further proof of that is this official standee for the "What am I Fighting Forrrrr" moment in Mega Man X4.
This came across our desk thanks to the official Mega Man Twitter account, which announced a new acrylic standee designed by artist Mikoto. You can pre-order it now on the site Yetee for $15, and it's expected to "ship in early December for customers in North America." My Mega Man shelf is completely full, but for all of you who have the space, this could be a funny conversation starter.
Here are the full details on the Mega Man X4 standee if you're looking for measurements:
Designed by Mikoto. Each includes:
1 x 4" x 6" Flat Acrylic Stand
1 x 4" x 6" Original Art Postcard
1 x 4" x 6" Secret Stage Logo Postcard
And of course, the original moment:

I often tell people that I am not a Pokémon fan. I say this while sitting in a Pikachu-branded chair, with my handmade Snom figurine hanging out on my desk next to my my off-brand plastic Swinub figurine, having played 90% of the available Pokémon games out there (I didn't bother with Black and White 2 and I didn't like Sun and Moon enough to get the Ultra version). But it's true. In a lot of ways, I am the Pokémon player that everyone complains about — the one who buys the games, has an okay time, wishes they were different, and then buys the next one anyway.
The thing is, it's more complicated than that. I love a lot of things about Pokémon, or I wouldn't keep shelling out for the games and the merch, would I? I love a lot of the designs from each generation, I love the increasing character customisation, and I love playing with friends and having an incredibly fun time messing around in Raid Battles. I love the innovation that each game brings, I love sharing discoveries online with the whole community, and I love choosing a starter all over again. See? I love a lot of things. At least six things.

Even the time capsule that's Classic WoW probably couldn't capture the same buzz of the past, mainly because I, as a being of flesh and bone, am not a teenager anymore. But I'd argue there's one place that still captures the essence of WoW more than WoW itself nowadays: YouTube. Or to be more specific, channels which provide hour-long music and ambience from some of the game's most memorable zones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being interested in both sci-fi and strategy games, I’ve always wanted to reshape the galaxy. The free 3.6 Orion update for Paradox’s spacey grand strategy Stellaris is live now, and it's done that, but in a way I hadn’t quite imagined. Among the changes with this update are six new galaxy shapes to mix up the pattern of your interstellar empires a bit. Orion also rebalances fleet combat, bringing in elements of the open beta that began back in October. Paradox have chucked in a few reworks of bits and pieces from Stellaris’ numerous expansions too, including changes to the Utopia DLC’s Ascension path. You can see more about that by watching the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.
Goodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. 


KO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. 
Goodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.]]></summary>

And yet, western fans are still to receive an official release date for this side of the globe — This is a curious development, given that WayForward is a U.S.-based developer and the game is seemingly ready to rock. To this end, the studio has released a new statement offering an update on the situation.

When Firaxis Games has anything in the hopper, I perk up. Hell, even 2013's now-defunct Haunted Hollow was fun. So when Marvel's Midnight Suns was announced, with no "co-developed" chicanery, I was in.
What I got was a fun little romp that's very different from many games they've made in the past, XCOM included.

Marvel's Midnight Suns (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Firaxis Games
Publisher: 2K
Released: December 2, 2022 (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S) | TBA (PS4, Switch, Xbox One X)
MSRP: $59.99

Astronite looks like it hails from the ZX Spectrum, and that’s precisely its goal. Touted as a “1-bit Metroidvania”, it’s rendered in stark black and white, with thin line art and all the evocative hallmarks of PC gaming's bygone age. It even features little floppy disk icons at its save points and old-style telephones at its teleportation devices, allowing you to hop from one side of the map to the other.
Astronite’s difficulty, too, is another callback to video gaming’s nascent years. A good, solid kind of challenge, it starts digging in as early as the Abandoned Grottoes with a nasty set of Mario World-like stone plungers, spikes, and water to hinder your movement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in 'if's and 'maybe's. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It's exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we've come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel's Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there's never any question about whether your moves will or won't work here. You're playing as the world's most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you're not already bulletproof, you've certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.

Question is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it's easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis' XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they've come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I've played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.

Yesterday's trailer for The Super Mario Bros.

While this second look let us hear a little more of Chris Pratt's Mario and Charlie Day's Luigi (a duo to be excited for), it turns out that the film's Spanish voice actors will be taking the pair to another level of familiarity.
As voiced in Spain's second trailer (and there is no confirmation that this is final for the full film) Mario and Luigi are voiced by Guillermo and Rafa Romero respectively - which means, in case you hadn't guessed it yet, the Mario Bros. are being played by actual bros (thanks, Nintendúo)!

As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — 'Emblems' — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

We love a bit of unseen footage here at Nintendo Life - especially when Zelda is involved. The N64 games have often been goldmines for this, with original trailers winding up on VHS tapes years later and revealing a whole host of unseen goodness for some classic titles.
One such example has recently been the case for a little indie title called The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - ever heard of it? Found on an old VHS tape, media preservationist @tanks404 uncovered some promotional material for the N64's Spring '97 line-up which includes some first-look proto footage at Ocarina of Time's Link in action.

The CPU supports PCIe 5.0 and DDR5, but it also works with cheaper DDR4- and PCIe 4.0-based hardware. 
It's normally £200, but it's down to £167 on AWD-IT which is a pretty decent deal if you want to build a powerful gaming PC on a budget.

I’m happy to see the Front Mission series finally getting some love over here in North America. It hasn’t been completely absent, but our coverage has been spotty. We missed a slew of them and only received three out of the five “numbered” titles. The fact that we’re getting not one but three remakes (one of them having never been localized) gives me hope that we’ll see more of the series over here. It worked for Yakuza, right?
This is actually my first chance to really delve into the series. My previous experience with it was watching my roommate fall in love with Front Mission 4. I don’t remember why I didn’t try it for myself because I recall it looking cool. Mechs are cool. Tactical strategy games are cool. It’s enough that I bookmarked …]]></summary>

If you happen to have booted up Dragalia Lost in the last few hours (and we'll be totally honest here: we certainly didn't), chances are you'll have been greeted by an end-of-service notification, because Nintendo has shut down the title as planned following its announcement earlier this year.
The mobile RPG, developed by Cygames, first launched back in 2018 and did pretty well for itself, all told, generating over $100 million in revenue within its first year of release. Nintendo and Cygames began to slow down on releasing new content back in August 2021 before confirming that the game would be shut down entirely in March 2022.

Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto was on hand to introduce the new trailer; Anya Taylor-Joy (who is playing Princess Peach) and Seth Rogan (who voices Donkey Kong) also shared selfie videos of themselves sharing their contractually obligated excitement about participating in the film.
The trailer showed more of the Mushroom Kingdom and primarily focused on Donkey Kong and Princess Peach. We also heard more from Chris Pratt's Mario, Charlie Day's Luigi, and Jack Black's Bowser (who explicitly refers to Mario as being a human). The trailer shows Mario training, fighting Donkey Kong, driving a kart on a rainbow road, traveling with Peach, and there was also one quick moment where we saw the human world.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7, 2023. You can see our live reaction to the trailer below.]]></summary>

A new look at the Mario movie is here, and it's got a lot in it. Today's trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie shows off more of the cast, plot, and hazards waiting for the crew this April.
The second trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie aired during today's Direct, specifically spotlighting the movie. Sorry, no Mario game news to share.
What we did get to see was much more of the cast, including Luigi, Princess Peach, and Donkey Kong. There are gladiatorial games, platforming, a Bowser torture scene, and even some Mario Kart happening on the Rainbow Road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnGl01FkMMo
From a training segment involving some floating platforms and hazards to DK slapping the dickens out of Mario, this definitely has a bit more of a Mushroom Kingdom vibe. Plus, we've heard a good chunk of the movie's cast now giving their takes on these classic Nintendo characters.
Off to the Mushroom Kingdom
We got our first official trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie not too long ago. That Direct featured both Chris Pratt (playing Mario) and Jack Black (Bowser) discussing their work on the film, then segueing into the full trailer. This time around, we got an intro from Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Princess Peach, and Seth Rogen, who plays Donkey Kong.
While the first trailer set the stage, this second one feels like it gives a pretty good idea of what the upcoming Nintendo and Illumination film will be like. An everyman-versus-Bowser isekai is certainly a way to take the Mario story, but I'm not entirely against it. We'll see how it comes together when The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres on April 7, 2023.

While details on 2023's Battle Hour are currently slim on the ground, we can expect Bandai Namco to showcase Dragon Ball games such as Dragon Ball Super Card, Dragon Ball Legends, and Arc System Works' excellent tag-fighter Dragon Ball FighterZ. It is currently unknown whether any unannounced games or DLC will be revealed on the stream, but one can only assume that the publisher will be bringing new news to the table and not leave the fans walking away empty-handed.
More details on the event, including a date, will be announced on December 3. We will, of course, bring you all of the pertinent information right here on Destructoid.

In Far Cry 6, protagonist Dani Rojas had to contend with an oppressive regime. But in the new DLC, Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, the threats a little more otherworldly.
Ubisoft revealed the trailer for Lost Between Worlds today, a Far Cry 6 story DLC that's arriving on December 6. It's coming to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation for $19.99. It's also part of the Upgrade Pass.
From the looks of it, the new DLC sends Dani into an alternate reality or dimension of some kind. Crystalline enemies await, alongside dangerous hazards and even crocodiles. You really just can't escape the crocodiles in Far Cry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRMbuyJyUzU
A mysterious voice, emitting from an orb of light, directs Dani on a path to put everything back to normal for the both of them. But, of course, the light may have its own aims and goals.
This fractured version of Yara will have 15 trials, with different ways of tackling them. Along the way, players can pick up new weapons and tools, and eventually acquire some powerful gear to bring back to the real Yara.
Back to Yara
Far Cry 6 has also been getting some further updates with Title Update 6. This adds New Game+, letting you bring any endgame equipment and weapons through to a new playthrough. It also adds a Completionist Aid feature, which should help with finding the many, many collectibles around Yara.
The game also has a free trial, so you can test it out and see if you like playing through Dani's explosive adventure across Yara.

The publisher had previously removed the title in order to spotlight its successor, Warzone 2.0, but has now reopened servers for the original bullet-pumping multiplayer title.
Remonikered "Warzone Caldera", the original Warzone is now available as a separate entity, featuring only two modes — Quads and Solos — and only one map — the titular Caldera. Additionally, Warzone Caldera has to be downloaded as a separate platform, adding a lot of sweaty weight to Call of Duty's already mammoth HDD footprint. For these reasons listed and others, die-hard Warzone 1.0 fans are disappointed in the title's "stripped down" reappearance.
This is an unfortunate inevitability with multiplayer-only titles, and battle royale releases especially. It's vitally important to an online game's lifespan that focus is placed on everyone "moving forward", as it were, ultimately ostracizing the players that may have been quite happy with the way things already are. It probably wouldn't take all that much time and effort for Activision to restore Warzone Caldera to its original status, but this, obviously, is unlikely to happen.
Activision and developers Raven Software and Infinity Ward will be focusing their time, money, and resources on the sequel, putting all of their eggs snugly into the Warzone 2.0 basket. The publisher and its subsidiaries will be doing all it can to ensure that Warzone's huge global player base does the very same.
Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fly me to the moon
A new month is almost upon us, and the PlayStation Plus games for December have leaked just before the date ticked over.
Dealabs, which has leaked the list of PS Plus games before, has the alleged games for this coming month. The Mass Effect Legendary Edition is reportedly due up, as is Biomutant and Divine Knockout, or DKO.
These games will reportedly be headed to PlayStation Plus' Essential tier, the base level of PS Plus in Sony's tiered structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8i53TtQ6IQ
The Mass Effect Legendary Edition needs little introduction. It's a remastered collection of the Mass Effect trilogy, putting the whole thing in one tidy, neat package. And frankly, if it's going up on PS Plus, there's even fewer excuses to not dip into this and try it. There's not many other RPGs out there that do what this trilogy did.
Biomutant is the rodent post-apocalyptic action game from Experiment 101 and THQ Nordic. It dropped last May and seemed like it got an okay reception. If you like the idea of playing as woodland critters with gritty looks and weapons, this might be up your alley.
As for Divine Knockout, that's a new multiplayer game from Red Beard Games and Hi-Rez Studios. According to a Steam page listing, it's a third-person platform fighter that seems to take a more 3D approach to its smashing and bashing.
Last chance for last month's games
Keep in mind that the changing of the calendar month also means November's games are rotating out. As the December PlayStation Plus games hit, the November ones depart. So if you've yet to pick them up, sooner's better than later.
For November 2022, the list included Nioh 2, Heavenly Bodies, and the LEGO Harry Potter Collection. Those will rotate out sometime in December, so be sure to nab them if you want them.

Games Montreal revealed that following the game's launch, four-player co-op, a heavily requested feature by fans, would be added in the form of a new mode called Heroic Assault. That mode, as well as a new two-player mode called Showdown, are both live now in Gotham Knights thanks to a new update. 
The base campaign of Gotham Knights allows for two-player co-op play, but getting all four of the knights together wasn't possible. That's still the case while playing through the game's story, but the new online cooperative Heroic Assault mode, which tasks players with defeating enemies and completing challenges across 30 floors, supports four-player play.

Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.
But removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history. I spoke to some developers of delisted games to find out more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 1.3.0 is out now
Nintendo Switch Sports is still trucking, and Nintendo just gave us a brand new game to play: Golf.
As promised earlier this year, the update is finally out that adds Golf to Switch Sports for free. It's not a particularly massive patch (we've gotten several that tweak or patch prior issues), but it adds the activity all the same, and highlights that it can be played in every mode (online, locally, or with friends). It also comes with a "shot assist mode," which can make the game easier to learn (or play in general): though it only works locally.
LAN play is fully in, and you can match up with local Switch owners (just like the recently released Pokemon Scarlet & Violet). You can find the full patch notes here, or below!
Switch Sports patch notes - Ver. 1.3.0 (Released November 28, 2022)
Golf
Golf has been added. It can be enjoyed in all modes: Play Globally, Play Locally and Play with Friends.
We added a Shot Assist mode in Golf to make it easier for beginners to play. To use it, go to Options → User Settings → Other.

This setting only applies to Play Locally and Play with Friends.
Please be aware that even if you have Shot Assist mode on, your setting will revert to Normal in Play Globally mode.
Play with Friends
LAN play is now compatible. For more information, please see How to Use the LAN Play Feature of Nintendo Switch Sports.
Overall
Several issues have been fixed to improve the gameplay experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because y'all love IPs and Content
In a quarterly earnings call held yesterday, Polish studio CD Projekt RED noted that it would be looking into more opportunities "in the transmedia space" following the smash success of Netflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners — an animated adaptation of the developer's hi-tech RPG Cyberpunk 2077.
While CDPR has already noted that it does not have plans to produce a second season of the flashy 'n' savvy series, the studio has been made very aware of the lucrative and creative potential of such projects, and, as reported by VGC, has made clear that it will be looking into similar adaptations in the future — be it through film, animation, and/or streaming series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax5YUmkWf_Y
Premiering in September of this year, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners offered up 10 episodes of rebellious, electric action, winning over fans with its flashy visuals, futuristic vistas, and gun-toting breakout star, Rebecca. The success of Edgerunners is hardly teaching CDPR any new lessons, given the global praise heaped upon The Witcher — another Netflix production that resides within CDPR's big book of brands.
The success of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is another example of modern media's creeping realization that adaptation and crossover is a far easier route to the Big Bucks than creating a fresh universe from scratch. You already have the world and its "rules" laid out for you, and you even a potential crossover audience from the get-go. Fans of a brand in one form of media are often given to swiftly switching over to another, and vice versa. As such, we can expect to see many more examples of this in the continuing era of digital entertainment.
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is now available exclusively on Netflix.

Having played all three previous seasons of Telltale's choose-your-own-zombie-apocalypse tearjerker (plus the 400 Days DLC and the Michonne spin-off), it's no surprise that I was incredibly invested in Clementine's story by The Final Season. I'm not a big kid person, typically, but you'd have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn't you? Even though, by the time TFS rolls around, she's grown into medium-sized Clem, and is a bit bloody scary to boot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we're a few years clear of Slay The Spire's chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I've sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence 'em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we'll see the launch of Marvel's Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It's a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I'm saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. 
Made by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It's a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That's because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you'll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, it's both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.

Blizzard have streamlined the early game, sure, but in doing so they've made it almost impossible to pin down my sense of place in the world. As Blizzard carves out new space for new regions and races with each and every expansion, I wonder: has the game become too big? Or put another way: am I unable to grasp just how vast its become?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has revealed that its upcoming remake of The Witcher will be open-world. 
This news comes by way of a quarterly financial call held yesterday by the company in which CDPR briefly touched on this remake being handled by developer Fool's Theory, as reported by VG247.  While not much was revealed, CDPR did reveal in the slide pictured below that Codename: Canis Majoris, which we now know to be The Witcher Remake, will be a "story-driven, single player open-world RPG" and a "modern reimagining of 2007's The Witcher."
This might come as a surprise because that 2007 game wasn't open-world and instead took players through small hub-like levels in the city of Vizima. 
Unfortunatley, this slide is essentially all that was revealed in regards to The Witcher Remake. It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to "please be patient" because "it's gonna be a while until we can share more details" when the company announced this game last month. 
The Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename "Hadar."

Games based on the interstellar action of the movie tend to end up veering towards the strategy genre though, such as the recent Terran Command. Well, Offworld Industries have loaded up a dropship with Starship Troopers: Extermination and plonked the licence right where it belongs on Planet Co-op FPS. It’s targeting a 2023 release, and probably the head carapace of a very confused giant alien insectoid, too. You can watch a short teaser for the game below.

If Microsoft show willingness to offer concessions and ease the EU regulator’s competition concerns, that could potentially speed up the regulator’s decision-making process.

A new video series in which Liam and I spend our precious free time with massive live-service games to see how much they demand from our schedules. Are we able to truly experience everything these games have to offer without sacrificing the bits of our daily routines that keep us from withering away at our monitors? How many hours do you really need to invest in order to fully experience a game? And is it even worth it, in the end? 
Inventory Space will – hopefully – give you a better idea of whether mammoth games will slot into your life neatly, or not at all.

Offworld is making Extermination in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and in the game, players will engage in squad-based FPS combat to exterminate the arachnid threat fans of the 1997 film will know really well. Those squads will need to work together in order to complete objectives, acquire resources necessary to continue the fight, build and defend a base of operations, and ultimately, escape to the one extraction point as a team.

If you are currently screen shopping, then, your best course of action is probably to take advantage of the current Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals.
My curated picks are all below, and as always, I’m only recommending sufficiently good hardware that’s available on a meaningful discount. A couple of our best gaming monitor members are even in here, though it’s a broad church overall, with 1080p, 1440p, and 4K screens making the cut alongside the occasional ultrawide model. We’re looking for gaming credentials specifically, too, so heightened refresh rates and support for variable sync tech (like FreeSync and G-Sync) are important.

The board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn't after a nostalgia kick.

For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you're mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what's a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It's not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.

This sci-fi game is both squad-based and match-based, a roguelite hero-shooter, and Tencent's publishing division Level Infinite even go as far as describing it as a rogue-looter, of all things. Whatever you want to call it, though, the main thrust of the game is about finding and taming machine creatures known as Nanos in a techno-apocalypse, mostly so you can battle more Nanos inside a special sealed zone called The Meridian.

Anyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was only a few days hence that we spotted a low price on the Ryzen 9 7900X, but for Cyber Monday there's an even better deal on offer at Amazon UK. 
The deal price is £456.70, versus a normal price of £600, and is for stock from Amazon US - but that includes shipping, import duty and all other potential fees. There's even the possibility that fees are less than expected, as several US items I've ordered from Amazons overseas have come with small discounts.

The Pulsefire Haste and Pulsefire Haste Wireless are ideal for competitive and casual gaming alike, with lightweight designs and high-end specs, and now you can pick either for little. 
The wired Pulsefire Haste (£20, normally £50) is the cheaper and lighter option, weighing in at 59 grams, while the wireless Pulsefire Haste Wireless (£40, normally £90) offers more freedom but requires recharging every 100 hours. It also weighs a tiny bit more, at 61 grams.

Although the remake of Ishin was announced during Sony’s September State Of Play stream, Kenzan seems quite far from being picked up for a revamp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega released Sonic Frontiers earlier this month and while fans have been finding plenty of fun in this new open world-ish take on the blue blur, they've also been running into some bugs. Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 "fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island," as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. 


Other fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. 
While waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matthias Linda is feeling tense. Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he's been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there's "still so many little and not so little things to do" before the big day hits on December 8th. "[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission," he says over email. "I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then."
But he also says he's "happy at the same time". After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it's clear Linda's got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat's also unlike anything else I've seen. You've still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you'll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party's abilities and you'll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you'll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It's a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda's desire to "build a bridge between the worlds" of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.

        <updated>2022-11-28T13:11:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. 
When asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are "planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU," Gunn responded, "Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation)." In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, "Yes." 
Yes.
November 27, 2022
It's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.
In fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.
This is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that.

New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crucial X6 is a USB solid state drive that I keep recommending, as it offers dependable SATA SSD speeds in a convenient yet rugged form factor. It comes in sizes from 500GB to 4TB, and now that massive biggest size is discounted: just £225, down from a UK RRP of £475 for a cool £250 discount.

You can now pick up this 2TB SATA SSD for just £93, making the drive just 4.7p per gigabyte - a very reasonable asking price for a drive that's significantly faster than an old HDD you may still have in your desktop or laptop...

It can figure out who needs persuading to do what, then engage with those players using impressive and effective natural language.

Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. 
Even more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…]]></summary>

It's an arena fighting game geared towards couch co-op and couch competition, but there's online play and single-player modes too. Yesterday's "THE TRIALS OF JAZEPS" update added new difficulty levels to wave survival, as well as custom trials you can send to your friends. 

It also chucks in some new maps with portals, because the only thing better than a lightsaber-wielding spider is a lightsaber wielding spider suddenly emerging from a portal.

They're often poor imitations of much deeper and exciting board and card games you can play in the real world, offered as an unwanted break from the monsters I've come to stick a sword through. Will Genshin Impact's upcoming Genius Invokation TCG buck that trend? 
Probably not, no, but we'll know for sure when the Version 3.3 update lands on December 7th. There's also a new quest that takes place after the game's main storyline, a couple new playable characters, and a Breakout mini-game. Ah. I do actually quite like Breakout.

I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.
Ratatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability. Atreus could summon the translucent blue squirrel to bring health items and sometimes hacksilver. In God of War Ragnarök, Ratatoskr is a physical, non-translucent c…]]></summary>

We recently had this chat in the RPS hive-mind, and going through each month and making note of my favourite releases completely shocked me with how many fantastic mystery games have come out this year. It’s honestly awesome. 
I’m a huge fan of mysteries in games, with some of my all-time favouites being Kentucky Route Zero, The Return Of The Obra Dinn, and Disco Elysium. I just like getting wrapped up in a good story that will kick my brain into gear. Strange murders, devious disappearances, and just general strange happenings - I love all of it.

Perhaps the full package will pale in comparison to Valve's polish, but the bit in this trailer where the player scurries down a train while contorting around manhacks looks oh-so appetisingly transportative. I think it's time I dug out my lighthouses.

Like all the best couch co-op games, it's very easy to get to grips with the controls: you have a sword, and you can raise it or lower it across three different heights to try and get around your opponent's guard. There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other's blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.
Oh look, now I'm holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I'm holding scissors! Oh, and now it's paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running. Fair enough, I suppose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Survival games! Oh, the many disparaging remarks I could make if only I had time in between punching rocks and eating an entire deer. It's not often that I recommend one here, and jokes aside, it'd be unfair and untrue to say it's because there aren't enough good ones. It's more that I don't have much room for new ones.

Lilith Odyssey is, if we must, a survival game and a roguelike (oh, the many dispara-[yeah alright, alright. Jesus. - ed.]), but that is reductive. This is a strange and somewhat contradictory game I feel uneasy comparing directly to anything, except possibly the wonderful Taxinaut (which is now on Steam, incidentally). Lilith Odyssey is very much what I'd call a vibes-based game.

Nevertheless, a few choice discounts have emerged for an unlikely group of chips: Intel’s 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors. These only released late in October, so it’s a welcome surprise to them on the Black Friday chopping block so soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my journey into the depths of TikTok's dabloon craze, I’ve joined a cult who worship the high priestess Dabloonis, have sailed across the high seas on a pirate ship called The Dabloonian, and accidentally taken part in a dabloon heist that's now made me a wanted fugitive by the dabloon police. It's been a strange couple of hours.
Dabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called "dabloons" cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It's as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...]]></summary>

The game's arguably at its most captivating when the hordes start clogging up your death machinery, squeezing you into tighter and tighter corridors as you pray for a power-up or multi-item chest. It's pleasantly squirmy, but will the bridge added in yesterday's appropriately titled "The Tiny One" update be too squirmy? 
The update also added a couple new achievements, and an item that lets you banish a weapon or power-up of your choosing across all of your runs. Come see.

Case in point: today’s rumblings that Grasshopper Manufacture, the devs behind the No More Heroes series, are working on a AAA game in the Aliens universe. This caught Grasshopper Manufacture's founder and CEO Goichi Suda, aka Suda51, so much by surprise that he wordlessly tweeted his utter bemusement at the rumour. I’m taking that as a no for the Alien game, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Black Friday means another opportunity for the Logitech G502 Hero - RPS readers' most favouritest gaming mouse - to get nice and cheap. This button-rich desk rodent is a particularly common sight during big PC hardware sales like Black Friday, but it's hard to tire of seeing when it's one of the best gaming mice ever made, and I actually prefer it to the recent G502 X refresh - especially when it's 56% off. That's precisely 56% off in both the UK and US, too.


Alright, technically it's the Logitech G502 Hero SE (Special Edition) that has the best available price in the UK; the standard model is £5 more for some reason. But the only difference between this and the all-black G502 Hero is the addition of some white highlights, so otherwise they share the same comfortable shape, highly customisable 11-button layout, and sharp 25,600dpi sensor.

Not only is that a big, meaty chunk of cash to carve off, it’s also an outstandingly low price for a gaming laptop with the RTX 3070 specifically. I’ve seen this high-end GPU in a few other laptops that are up for Black Friday sales, but they’re tending more towards the £1100 mark. In terms of getting the most graphical power for the least money, then, the Katana GF66 is unlikely be beaten today. Even by the RTX 3080 laptop for £1200 deal that's still going.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn't faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

However, that is slowly changing, with Black Friday Eve bringing a new low price on the high-end CPU: £475, down from a launch RRP of £600. That's a tidy £125 discount and a great price for one of the fastest consumer CPUs money can buy.

And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s September 13, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is just over 24 hours away from revealing its big plans for the future.
It’ll be a night of celebrities, game announcements, and an infamous afterparty full of alcohol, confetti, and blaring music. It’ll take over Twitter, and leave more than a few people nursing headaches the following day.
But today, instead of focusing on his big night, studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama is sitting in a conference room talking about why he loves Neon Genesis Evangelion. Read more...]]></summary>

There’s no re-using old DDR4 sticks with AMD’s latest and greatest, then, but with this week’s Black Friday deals you could get a brand new DDR5 kit for less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll have heard by now that Pentiment is bloody good. It's a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It's inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).
In the ol' days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren't educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You've probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.

Occasionally though, Blizzard stumble with their cosmetic offerings, rather like they’ve tripped over an invisible dog. Players have been taking to Twitter and Reddit to voice their irritation with support hero Moira’s rather uninspired new legendary skin, based on the classic black and white look of mime artists everywhere. Just like mime artists themselves, it’s not very popular.

That’s a £90 saving on the RRP, and the cheapest that this set of wireless cans has ever been in the UK.

Banks compares the base-building app’s simplicity to Oskar Stålberg’s procedurally generated hamlet-crafter Townscaper, although it seems a bit more complicated than that game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo's history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands.

Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-23T16:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon "Emblems," characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.


Units can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.
In total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.
Fire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.]]></summary>

But with so many games out there, how do you separate a perfect holiday gift from a dastardly holiday grift? Fret not!

The two take you through the game's opening, showcasing what exactly you do in this Atari museum as its sole caretaker, from sweeping away dust to killing bugs and more. 
The two also discuss how presenting Atari games as a WarioWare-like microgame collection is the perfect way to showcase these classic titles. It doesn't hurt that the museum experience in the game gives players the chance to admire high-quality screens of classic Atari game box art, game manuals, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it's an easy one. Sometimes it's agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you're rolling with. While you're at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.]]></summary>

Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it's been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me's release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. 


"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized," Wingefores said in the statement. "The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition."
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an "internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups," but says that "it is not necessarily the last." 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It's a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn't too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here's the full statement on the delay:

The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.]]></summary>
