        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today's RuneScape Ahead, developer Jagex revealed the upcoming roadmap for the popular MMORPG RuneScape, through the rest of 2024 and into 2025. Players can expect to see 110 skilling updates, new combat bosses, new storylines, a highly requested new area expansion, and the addition of the highly-anticipated Group Ironman mode.




The new Group Ironman mode will allow up to five friends to start a brand new RuneScape adventure without any sort of XP bonuses and without the ability to benefit in any way from players outside of the group they start with. In an effort to make the mode more functional, those participating in Group Ironman mode will have access to Group Storage as well as unique rewards including cosmetics and milestone capes. The new mode is expected to be released later this year alongside the new Harvest Hollow seasonal event and the addition of a new Necromancy Conjure Ability titled Phantom Guardian.


Before the new mode, players can expect to see the release of an all-new boss dungeon called the Sanctum of Rebirth alongside a skilling update to 110 Mining and Smithing, and a new skilling boss titled Gate of Elidnis with its own launch event and story quest.


Heading into 2025, 110 Runecrafting and Crafting will also get a skilling update, as well as a skilling rebalance and the addition of two new story quests and a new combat bass, the Amascut Showdown. Finally, in late 2025, a new area expansion is planned for release in RuneScape.


Those interested in seeing the future of RuneScape as the developers delve into more detail about the new roadmap can do so by checking out a special live stream taking place tomorrow, August 16 on the official RuneScape Twitch channel.

Quite different from the in-game difficulty modes on offer, Game Style determines how the AI will play. From reacting to your selected play to managing the subs, there are three different styles of AI you can use in a game. Naturally, all three are pretty different, but there's no right or wrong choice. When it comes to Franchise mode, one particular style certainly outdoes the remaining options.

The Grumpy Fishercat (yes, that's what he's called in the game) can be found at the northern tip of Straits Island, just north of Pawt Purvanna. Settle in, folks. The puns don't end here. After destroying the two pi-rat ships harassing him, chat him up to start The Furlorn Fishercat quest.

How to get the Gloves of the Illuminator in Diablo 4


The Gloves of the Illuminator can be obtained either as a very rare world drop or a boss drop from Grigoire or The Beast in the Ice.


If you’re looking to get it as a world drop because you don’t have access to the ladder bosses yet, it’s best to try and play the endgame activities currently in the game. Such activities include Nightmare Dungeons, The Pit, Helltides, PvP, Whisper Caches, and the newly introduced Infernal Hordes.

For those of you who would rather not have the game spoiled, here’s a spoiler-free summary of my thoughts: It’s Earth Defense Force 5 if one of its developers woke up from a fever dream with deranged inspiration for how to extend it by nearly 150 missions. Even if you finished EDF 5 a few months ago, you might go into EDF 6 and not see much has changed aside from more dirt, a new narrative, and a couple of other small additions. It is not much of an upgrade, but you couldn’t ask for a better continuation.

You can repair your motorcycle, as well as weapons and armor, and you can technically use the Pickaxe as a weapon, but can you repair it?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Unfortunately, you can’t repair the Pickaxe in Once Human. It’s one of the more puzzling things about the tool, besides perhaps the fact that it’s called a Pickaxe when it looks like an axe and can be used both to chop down trees and mine ore. However, don’t despair: As you unlock the different skills in your Cradle, you’ll learn to craft stronger Pickaxes that don’t deteriorate as quickly as your scrubby beginner one.


What can you do with your breaking Pickaxes in Once Human?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Don’t use your Pickaxes until they break! That will cause them to vanish from your inventory, lost forever. Instead, use them right up to the breaking point, then stash them away until you make a trip to town, where you can sell them for a few quick Energy Links. The sturdier Pickaxes are worth more money. 


It’s an odd little inconvenience, being unable to repair Pickaxes even though your base is filled with workbenches. Perhaps developer Starry Studio will decide to make the Pickaxe in Once Human repairable eventually. But for now, they’ve probably got other things higher on their priority list, like preparing for the coming server reset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each week in Destiny 2 brings a new Nightfall mission and a weapon to grind the god roll for. This is the go-to for most endgame players as you get access to some very strong Adept weapons sporting some fantastic perks.


One such weapon has a unique god roll thanks to its archetype, and it only comes around ever so often. Here's the god roll for the Undercurrent grenade launcher in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Undercurrent in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


The Undercurrent is part of the Wave Frame archetype of grenade launchers, which means the grenades it shoots send out a wave when they hit the ground. This damages all enemies in a line and makes the weapon great for ad clear. However, this also means the iconic build of running Disorienting Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, and Vorpal Weapon doesn't work. However, the following build does nicely:



Launcher Barrel: Quick Launch


Magazine: High-Velocity Rounds


Perk 1: Demolitionist


Perk 2: Voltshot



Quick Launch lets you get that shot out from the Undercurrent much faster, giving better weapon ready speed and projectile speed for a good combination. High-Velocity Rounds expands on that, giving you an even faster reload and projectile speed for follow-up shots. Demolitionist makes for a great flow between regenerating your grenade charge, throwing it out, and then repeating the process with a reloaded grenade launcher. Finally, there's Voltshot, which seriously improves the ad clear potential through jolt.


If running this with a grenade build isn't your forte, then Ambitious Assassin is a great alternative perk, provided you can get several kills with one grenade. You could also run Lead from Gold to seriously improve your ammo economy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive announced today that the new Stellaris: Cosmic Storms expansion for the sci-fi strategy game is set to launch via PC on September 10, 2024. The new expansion brings new technologies and edicts to respond to the new Cosmic Storm threat as well as the all-new Storm Chaser origin and two new precursor stories.




While storm systems already exist in Stellaris, the new Cosmic Storms expansion adds 8 new types of Cosmic Storms that replace the existing Space Storms and randomly spawn across the map. The new Cosmic Storms are Electric, Particle, Gravity, Magnetic, Radiant, Stardust, Shroud, and Nexus. The storms will automatically grow, shrink, and change speeds as they work their way across the galaxy.


Alongside the storms is the new Storm Chaser Origin, an empire of people that seek to push themselves beyond their own limits. As such, they strive for enlightenment by engaging with the new fierce Cosmic Storms that the universe sends at them.


With the new Storm Chaser Origin comes three new civics: Astrometeorology, Storm Devotion, and Environmental Architects. There are also two new precursor stories that discover the stories of the Ancients, vanished masters of the storms: Weather Manipulators and the adAkkaris Convention of Benevolence. Completing each narrative will unlock a new relic.


Stellaris: Cosmic Storms will be released on PC via Steam on September 10, 2024, at the price point of $12.99. It's part of the Season 8 Season Pass and will also be added to the monthly Expansion Subscription for Stellaris.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2's Salvation's Edge raid weapons are all rather unique, if not in function then definitely in appearance. Each one is about as weird as the visuals of the raid itself, not that this makes them any less powerful.


Among them is a new sword that, while not including Eager's Edge, has a rather potent DPS combo for certain boss fights: The Summum Bonum.


Here's the god roll for the Summum Bonum sword in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


The Summum Bonum sword sports the highly sought-after Wave Frame archetype, allowing its heavy attacks to send out a wave in front of you. This gives your sword a little range if you either get pushed back or are still approaching the enemy. The following perks and attachments should pair nicely with it:



Blade: Hungry Edge


Guard: Balanced Guard


Perk 1: Relentless Strikes


Perk 2: Chaos Reshaped



Hungry Edge immediately provides max sword ammo, which is something swords tend to struggle a lot with. Any buff there helps a ton. Balanced Guard gives a much better guard, though you shouldn't worry about ittoo much since you won't be using it. Relentless Strikes is where things get interesting since it gives back sword ammo on continuous light swings---which you'll be doing many of. Finally, we have Chaos Reshaped, increasing damage based on how long you're in combat. A great buff for boss DPS.


How to get the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2


The Summum Bonum comes from the new Salvation's Edge raid. It can drop from the second encounter (Herald of Finality), the fourth encounter (Verity), or the fifth one (The Witness). On top of this, the object that appears after defeating The Witness lets you spend 20 Spoils of Conquest to get a deepsight version of whatever weapon you want, including the Summum Bonum. Getting five of these grants you the ability to craft it.

Publisher The Arcade Crew and developer Assoupi have revealed a brand-new platformer called Mainframes. It's a refreshingly unique take on the genre in which you take on the role of Floppy who, in an effort to discover its true function, sets off on a quest of self-identity.
The cool thing with this one is that the levels are essentially built to look like a computer desktop, with the platforms being actual program windows that you can alter at will. You'll encounter cute characters on your journey and relax to some lighthearted music tracks that feel perfectly suited to the pixel art world.

This is a great card especially for beginners as it's pretty easy to obtain. There's just one task, and it's really easy to get the required fodder as well. Let's take a look at how good the new card is, and if you should invest your resources in it. 


EA FC 24 Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC tasks


The solo task has certain conditions that you'll need to meet while submitting the squad. 


Task 1 - Casey Murphy



Min. Team Rating: 88


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW



EA FC 24 Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC solutions


The Casey Murphy FUTTIES SBC can be completed for about 40,000 coins. 


Task 1 - Casey Murphy



Mapi Leon: 89


Irene Paredes: 88


Victor Osimhen: 88


Any 88-rated TOTS/TOTW card


Marie Katoto: 88


Jan Oblak: 88


Joshua Kimmich: 88


Lucy Bronze: 87


Lina Magull: 87


Gianluigi Donnarumma: 87


Lea Schuller: 86



Compared to women goalkeepers, Murphy has decent height at 6 ft. However, I am not comfortable using anyone apart from a really tall goalkeeper in my team. It suits well considering the aerial meta of the game at the moment. That said, a 97-rated card can be incredibly useful to complete SBCs like Mia Hamm Icon or David Ginola Heroes. If you have the spare fodder, which you should, make sure to complete this FUTTIES SBC.

We've separated our Old School RuneScape Skills Tier List into two different categories: free-to-play and members. The game's paid content is so much more in-depth that it's difficult to directly compare the two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wholesome Games Steam event is here to announce new games and spotlight current releases, and one of today's reveals is Ritual of Raven. This witchy farming sim comes from Spellgarden Games, who previously worked on Sticky Business. It's currently due out through publisher Team17 sometime in 2025.


Beyond Steam, Ritual of Raven is eyeing a release on Nintendo Switch. Spellgarden is aiming for maximum coziness with this one, as previewed in the announcement trailer below.




Ritual of Raven describes itself as a farming sim, but you actually collect and enchant Arcana Constructs to work on your magical herb garden for you. While these magical creatures help grow ingredients for rituals, it's up to you to embark upon quests, befriend various characters, and get to tradin'. You'll also want to suss out what's up with all these portals that have been popping up throughout the land.


If the crux of your coziness lies in customization, it seems there's plenty of it to go around here. You can decorate your farm as you see fit, and you can also apply a bunch of customization options to the wider world of magic beyond your farm's borders.


Enchanting ingredients

So far, it all looks like it's eyeing a nice balance between chill sim gameplay and a touch of mystery lurking around the edges. If you want to try it out for yourself and happen to be heading to gamescom, Ritual of Raven will be playable at the event. Look for the demo at the Indie Arena Booth in Hall 10.2 | F010 E019 for all your occult-adjacent cultivating needs.

If you’ve ever lost track of time decorating your farmhouse and passed out, only to wake up in the void of black space the next morning, then this patch is going to come as a relief to you---and for those who managed to accidentally put their Worn Tools in a Shipping Bin and have been stuck without tools, you’ll be happy to know that this update also fixes that issue and many more. 


It’s worth noting that this is not an update intended to bring more features to the game, such as those mentioned in the Early Access roadma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Undercover R&B episode, you'll take control of Version 1.1's newest up-and-coming character, Jane Doe. She's on a secret mission involving the Mountain Lion Gang, where she eventually stumbles upon a locker that requires a code. To get you back on track, we'll show you the correct passcode in Zenless Zone Zero's Undercover R&B Special Episode.


Zenless Zone Zone Undercover R&B six-digit code, explained


According to the note near the locker, clues can be found throughout the room to determine the correct passcode. More specifically, it mentions how frequently shown numbers are the key to solving this puzzle. If you look at the piece of paper in the office, you'll see that the six-digit code 101225 appears the most, which is the correct passcode to the ZZZ Undercover R&B episode.


If you're having trouble entering this room, you can go through the gates on the right side of the counter. However, some players have indicated that these gates wouldn't allow access. In this case, restart the game and try to go through it again to fix the issue.

Once the locker opens, head to the equipment room and grab the master keycard. The path from here is relatively straightforward, but you'll still need the Port Peak videotape to satisfy the gangster's request. You can find it in the Proxy's main hub at Random Play.


Although the Proxy will take point at this stage, you'll play as Jane Doe again in the next phase. It's the perfect chance to get familiar with her combat and movement, as she will appear as a banner in the second half of Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you and your friends have the dream of managing NFL teams, Madden NFL 25's Franchise mode is the perfect option to test yourselves (albeit on the virtual platform).


I love playing the Franchise mode as a solo journey, where I am up against the AI managers. But there's an option to conduct a league between you and your friends, where each of you takes charge of a franchise. Let's take a look at the exact steps of setting up a multiplayer league and how your friends can join them.


How to create a multiplayer league with Madden NFL 25 Franchise mode


Creating a multiplayer league in Madden NFL 25 isn't very different from a solo league.



Open and load the game.


Select Franchise.


Go to League Creation and pick the second option.


Select the franchise of your choice.


Proceed to the next stage to open league settings. Here, you can tweak different settings, including making it public or private (password-protected).






To play with your friends, make sure to create a private league. The maximum number of users is 32. Next, note down the league name and password and share it with your friends.


If you or your friend want to join a league, they can do so from the Franchise mode as well. They will have to enter the league name and password to join the league. Once they're in, they can pick a franchise of their liking and continue with the different aspects of management.


That's pretty much it when it comes to playing Franchise mode with your friends. Just make sure to coordinate and decide who's picking which franchise so there's no quarrel about it later.

        <updated>2024-08-15T16:19:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts released an all-new trailer for the upcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard today that showed glimpses of what to expect from the first title in the series in almost a decade. The focus of the trailer, however, was to indicate when we can expect to get our hands on The Veilguard: October 31, 2024.




Even though we've had to wait almost 10 years to get back to Dragon Age, the wait is almost over. With a Halloween 2024 release date that means we're just 2.5 months away from getting our hands on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.


Surely not coincidentally, the story in The Veilguard takes place a decade after the events of its predecessor, Dragon Age: Inquisition. Players will take on the role of Rook and his companions as they put an end to a ritual in progress by Solas, one of your allies and party members from Inquisition who has become a villain. However, doing so breaks free the corrupt Elven gods who are hellbent on blighting the world, and it's now up to you and your party to fight back against the ancient rulers.


For those interested in freshening up on their Dragon Age lore and knowledge, all of the Dragon Age games are currently on sale for 90% off on all platforms through August 19 as part of the ongoing Electronic Arts August sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chore-y of Seasons.
Elrentaros Wanderings is a brand-new game from Rune Factory creator Yoshifumi Hashimoto and his studio, Hakama, which takes place across two parallel worlds: one in a present-day Japanese school, and one in a fantasy land where a small village is plagued by monsters that live in nearby dungeons.
Your character — male or female — must be the one to clear out these dungeons, making friends with the locals and upgrading weapons to take on progressively harder dungeons. But sometimes, when you go to sleep at night, you wake up in that parallel universe... and all the characters seem like the ones you just got to know in the village. How strange!

Like a herd of frigates scenting a pride of destroyers lurking behind a nearby asteroid, I rerouted hastily and took up a holding position approximately one astronomical unit from the Buy button, hoping that the developers might iron out a few of the wrinkles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

We love one-off designs though; statues that likely won't be made available to the general public, but nevertheless showcase a level of originality that simply can't be replicated elsewhere. And yes, we're a little bit jealous that we can't get our hands on them, too.

The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

But we're more worried about all of those wires behind the TV. Though Al-Nasser has a method of keeping all of the cables hidden and tidy behind there. Plus, Al-Nasser hooks them all up using around 30 RCA switchers, 12 HDMI switchers, converters, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KIBORG: Arena feels like a throwback in several ways that I quite enjoy. It’s a free prologue to the upcoming cyberpunk puncher KIBORG. The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satirical space RPG sequel The Outer Worlds 2 was announced back in 2021. Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

After a recent beta update mentioned adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s inputs, The Verge confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

After a slight delay this week, the UK Charts are finally in, and it's another quiet one in the region that sees Mario Kart 8 Deluxe retain its crown for a second week running.
The top 10 has seen a bit of a shake up, though, with Mortal Kombat 1 storming to 3rd place while Hogwarts Legacy takes a bit of a tumble down into 10th. A few fresh faces re-enter the top 40 too, with the likes of Lego City Undercover, Pokémon Scarlet, and even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered poking their heads out of the sand.

Uptobox tried to reverse this decision, arguing that it's not the piracy haven rightsholders make it out to be, but the court denied that challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Those 90s cowards. Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The "Crush Depth" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

Fortunately they're more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn't mean precision blocking won't be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

The project in question is Tramstertram. Aside from being a terrifying feat of punmanship, it's a browser-based building toy from Matt Stark, creator of the really rather lovely Viewfinder.

The same is apparently true of the multiplayer Control spin-off Project Condor and the Max Payne 1 & 2 remakes, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developers Rockstar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I zoom the camera on Alex's momentarily untensed face while he's dozing by the pool, it's not because I'm a creep. When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it's not because I'm a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it's not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

The Italian football league filed a legal complaint in April, claiming that Cloudflare assists and protects pirate services. In a decision handed down this week, the Court of Milan said that it has no legal authority to compel Cloudflare to join the program. The Court also denied Serie A's application for an injunction, for reasons that suggest this battle may not be over.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WolfEye's debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored's immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I'll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RIAA and several other organizations condemn AI startup Anthropic for allegedly flaunting copyright law. The criticism appears in an amicus brief in support of a court injunction requested by music publishers, who want the AI company to stop using lyrics without permission. According to the RIAA, Anthropic's defense relies on the same rhetoric as Napster once did.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

The blockbuster JRPG isn't out on PC yet, and developers Square Enix have not given a concrete release date for it, but this does seem to be prep work for the inevitable. And with Squeenix in attendance at Gamescom, it's possible we'll know more soon.

My own very petty victory as the ultimate gambler aside, it's by and large an industry built on preying on the vulnerable, so it's no surprise that Balatro developer LocalThunk is so dead against ever seeing his poker puzzler used for evil that he's made a specific stipulation in his will.

Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

Pay TV revenues were less affected than one might expect.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Vampire Survivors review, Matt Cox described the game as something he could play with "one hand in a packet of crisps". I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.
All of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.
The only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: "Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article." My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.
It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week sees the release of a new Steam edition of Type-Moon and Kinoko Nasu's dark fantasy visual novel and dating sim Fate Stay/Night. I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

Those DLCs will let you meet "notorious gambler" Lando Calrissian and "veteran pirate" Hondo Ohnaka, who I am definitely familiar with.

Last week it was carnivorous post-Soviet elevators, now it’s retro fantasy RPGs that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.

Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.


Sin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.


Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former Destiny 2 game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's brutal cost-cutting this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a "hit and miss" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Again, but better" has become the maxim of post-Steam Deck portable PCs. Or, to be more specific, post-Steam Deck OLED ones. Now that Valve have shown it’s possible to quickly turn around an upgraded handheld without enraging owners of the original, Lenovo have hinted at a new Legion Go, MSI have revealed an improved Claw, and Asus have released this here ROG Ally X. A ROG Ally, again – but better? Yes, it is, in almost every way except the speed at which it’ll plunge you into financial destitution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toonsouls, which you can find on Steam here, doesn’t appear to screenshot especially well. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of those perpetually disgruntled ghosts and charming goofskulls, but I might not be writing about the platform game at all if I hadn’t seen it in motion, where the vision comes together a lot more. The Cuphead influence runneth so overly that it feels trite to even point it out, and I do think maybe opting for different music would have served it far better in this case, but you can’t deny that Ghosts n’ Goblins lance throw. Get stuck in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jail shake-and-breaker management sim Prison Architect 2 has been delayed indefinitely, a couple of months after publishers Paradox parted ways with original developers Double Eleven. Current developers Kokku will use the additional time "to improve both the game's performance and its content". Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a "robust" release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.

Now Mountaintop Studios, a new studio whose ranks include ex-Bungie and Respawn devs, have chucked themselves into the tactical FPS gauntlet with Spectre Divide. Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies. I… am cautiously optimistic? I think?
