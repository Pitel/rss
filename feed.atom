When it launched in 2017, Persona 5 represented the next evolution of the Persona formula. Persona 5 Royal amplifies the stellar turn-based combat and masterful social mechanics, as well as the complex systems surrounding them. But it also adds new characters, story arcs, and a meaty post-game palace that ventures even deeper into the world’s lore to deliver the definitive way to experience Persona 5.
The gameplay loop of the original remains intact: You hunt for corrupted individuals, infiltrate dungeons based on their personalities, and battle through tons of enemies – all while going to school and dev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crucial make some of the best SSDs in the industry, and here at RPS we have a particular fondness for their portable SSDs, which are both reasonably priced and way faster than any flash drive or portable hard drive that you've ever tried. Several of their drives have been discounted for Easter in the UK, so we've rounded up a few of our favourites for your enjoyment. 
First up: the Crucial X8. This drive is the fastest portable option that the Idahoan company offers, with read speeds up to 1050MB/s and sizes of 1TB and 2TB - and both options are top deals on Amazon UK right now. The 2TB model is actually the better value here, and it's well worth getting if you like keeping a large amount of files ready to go - whether that's game installs or Ultra HD videos. I personally use the 1TB model to move video files from my PC to the TV downstairs to watch, and it's surprising how quickly you can fill up a 1TB drive with 4K footage. In Katharine's testing back in 2020, she found it performed better than competing Samsung drives while costing less. 
If you don't need as fast a drive, and instead want to max out your capacity, then the Crucial X6 is half the speed and darn near half the price. You can also get it in some truly massive sizes, from 500GB all the way up to 4TB. Happily, some of those giant models are on sale, with the flagship 4TB model costing £252 - just £100 more than the X8 for double the storage. You can also get it with a USB-C to USB-A adapter for £262, but I don't think that's a particularly compelling offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The WD Black SN850 is one of the best-reviewed NVMe SSDs on the market, one of those 'second-gen' PCIe 4.0 drives that can hit blistering read speeds of up to 7000MB/s. Today, the heatsink-equipped model is down to a historic low price of £140 for a 1TB model, or £255 for a 2TB model. Either way, you're getting a top-spec drive at a very competitive price.
The SN850 is a drive that we've tested and recommended here at RPS, with RPS head honcho Katharine dubbing it 'the best PCIe 4.0 SSD we've tested yet' after it debuted early last year. I've double-checked the 'best SSD for gaming' archives, and it turns out that there haven't been any better PCIe 4.0 SSDs since then either. Go figure. The SN850 wins plaudits for its game load times, which are routinely among the best we've recorded, but also for its longevity with a five year warranty. 
What makes this deal particularly good is that we normally see discounts on the heatsink-less model, but this is the version with a heatsink. The two flavours are pretty similar in performance - most reviews I've seen only notice a difference after a sustained load - but this is definitely the premium version and the one you want to get. This is particularly handy if you're putting this drive into a PC motherboard that doesn't have its own NVMe SSD heatspreaders, or into a PS5 where a heatsink is recommended. As DirectStorage becomes ever more of a thing and NVMe SSDs start to become fully utilised for PC gaming, that difference could become rather more important!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All April long, the AT&T Annihilator Cup is happening on Twitch, featuring a host of popular personalities and a wide variety of games. Twenty high-profile streamers take on five wildly different game experiences to earn points, from fighting to asymmetrical horror to FPS action. 
The event is live each Friday on the official AT&T Twitch channel. Also, it is definitely going to be interesting to see streamers that are well-versed in their genres of choice tackle games that might be way outside their expertise, like Street Fighter or Dead By Daylight.

The company initially announced last week that they would no longer require people be vaccinated in order to return, then seemed to quickly walk this back a bit in response to many employees saying excuse me, what. An employee group had announced a walkout before Actiblizz's change of heart, and apparently are going ahead today to continue conversations about safe workplaces and the option to work from home.

As a father of a nine-year-old daughter, I get asked these questions frequently by people with children of their own, and I always stumble with my response as I try to recall the route I took to acclimate her to games. Most kids want to play games at an early age, yet there aren’t many resources out there that help parents and guardians find a safe and re…]]></summary>

Publisher Fellow Traveller and developer Jump Over The Age (of In Other Waters fame) have announced that Citizen Sleeper is coming to Switch on 5th May.
Mixing tabletop RPG elements into a sci-fi narrative adventure, the game sees you play as a Sleeper, "a digitised human consciousness who is on the run from the corporation who own the artificial body you inhabit". You end up on a ruined space station and have to strike up relationships with the other people on board in a bid to survive and evade The Man and make a life for yourself in space. Check out the trailer above to get more of an idea how the dice-roll gameplay works.

Eastasiasoft has announced a release date for its updated release of PS Vita RPG Genkai Tokki: Seven Pirates. The retitled Seven Pirates H — which is coming to Switch with various 'enhancements' in the gameplay department — is out now in Japan but is getting a worldwide release on 12th May.
Self-described as a "Booby Training RPG" — and "a traditional RPG focused on exploration and discovery with a gigantic dose of fanservice thrown in" — the new version of the 2016 original features various Switch-only elements which according to the game's official website include additions such as "using L/R sticks to control things like Booby Training and the Otton Charge" (touch controls are naturally also available) and rumble functionality for added vibes. "New flesh tone swimsuits, Booby Training limit breaks and more" are also included. More? Apparently so.

Drinkbox Studios - known for its 'Metroidvania' titles Guacamelee! and Guacamelee 2! - has announced that the top-down RPG Nobody Saves the World will be coming to Nintendo Switch on April 14th for $24.99.
Originally released on Xbox and PC on January 18th, 2022, the game marks a stark departure from the Guacamelee! series and the touch-focused action title Severed, marking Drinkbox's first proper foray into the RPG genre. The Switch release will also come with local co-op functionality on day one, with two players able to play together in Tabletop Mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monkey Island's long hiatus is finally coming to an end, and its creator is returning along with the series.
In collaboration with Devolver Digital and Lucasfilm Games, Terrible Toybox is developing Return to Monkey Island, a new pirating adventure starring Guybrush Threepwood. Industry legend and Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion creator Ron Gilbert runs Terrible Toybox and will be involved in this new franchise entry.

Return to Monkey Island will act as a direct sequel to Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, picking up where the 1991 point-and-click adventure left off. The series' floundering hero, Guybrush, will be voiced again by his original actor, Dominic Armato. 
Monkey Island has previously had a string of revivals over the years, with Telltale taking a crack at the series with Tales of Monkey Island in 2009 and Special Edition remasters of The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2 around the same time. 
We still don't know about Return to Monkey Island other than what's shown in the trailer above, but there is a release window set for this year. We'll be sure to report more as information is released on this project in the coming weeks and months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.

 Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation has reportedly laid off nearly 90 employees in its North American offices. 
This news comes by way of a new report from Axios, which writes that most of the cut positions were in the sales and marketing departments of the company. As for why, PlayStation leadership reportedly cited a “global transformation” of the company’s sales and business operations in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
The cuts, which have not been publicly disclosed by Sony or its PlayStation arm, happened last week, one laid-off employee told Axios. More specifically, documents reveal Sony PlayStation is ending its “merchandiser” team in the U.S., with roles like PlayStation Representatives and more terminated. These employees were often responsible for going to brick-and-mortar stores to sell PlayStation products and educate employees there on those products.
Multiple retail marketing jobs were cut as well, according to Axios. One worker laid off told the publication that they felt the company could have done more to find laid-off employees alternate jobs within it. They also said they were disappointed PlayStation had not told the affected departments sooner than they did.

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a massive game, consisting of roughly 400 playable characters, nine movies to journey through, and more puns, jokes, and sight gags than even Jar Jar Binks can handle.

More Star Wars? Really? We wouldn’t blame you in the slightest if your reaction to more Star Wars, whether it be of the film, TV series or video game variety, was somewhat apathetic at this stage given the sheer amount of it we’ve had thrown at us in recent years. Indeed, as we sat down to boot up this latest LEGO Star Wars adventure, we couldn’t help but wonder if we were particularly up for diving into this universe from scratch all over again.
However, after just a handful of minutes — yes, minutes — with LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, well… we were completely hooked in and ready to savour every moment of this epic space adventure once more. TT Games has served up a spectacular re-treading of the three trilogies here, combining fast and frantic campaign missions that bounce from set-piece to set-piece as they take in all the big moments from the movies, and a huge open world that’s absolutely stuffed to the gills with secrets, puzzles and exploration to dig into in your downtime. It’s a Star Wars fan’s fever dream and, for our Galactic Credits at least, the very best LEGO game this developer has made to date. Yep, it’s that good.

      Blue Box Game Studios
      
Blue Box Game Studios revealed Abandoned, a PlayStation 5-exclusive survival horror game, in April of last year and since then, it’s been on a ride, and not a particularly great one. 
After people began to speculate that Abandoned was actually a new Silent Hill game, Blue Box definitively shut the rumors down. Then, some began to speculate that somehow, Hideo Kojima was behind Abandoned and Blue Box – Blue Box was seen as “BB,” like the term used throughout Death Stranding. Despite Blue Box saying it was not associated with Hideo Kojima, the studio leaned into it, posting an image of a hidden face with a very Metal Gear Solid-esque eye patch. 
Blue Box reiterated that it was not associated with Kojima and a few days later, people spotted another tie between the famed director and the studio. Things subsided for a few weeks and then Blue Box posted yet another thing that caused people to further speculate on the Blue Box-Kojima connection. Since all of this, Blue Box’s playable Abandoned prologue has yet to be released as promised in Q1 of 2022 and speculation that Abandoned had been canceled began to rise. 
However, in a new statement from Blue Box, the studio has addressed these cancellation rumors. Here’s what it says, in full:

The Switch isn't short of retro-inspired action RPGs, but that doesn't mean we don't have room for more if they can offer fun and creativity. Toasty: Ashes of Dusk, developed by Pocket Llama, will arrive in the second half of 2023 and cites the likes of Final Fantasy, EarthBound and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past as sources of inspiration.
Though the trailer shows a game that's still relatively early in development, there's plenty of creativity and style on show. Pleasingly the Switch is getting a good focus in the game's successful Kickstarter campaign, including confirmation and pre-orders on a physical edition.

Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are still receiving plenty of love from The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, and the remakes’ developer, Ilca, and much of that love comes in the form of Mystery Gift distributions. 
There was a Mystery Gift event back in December that offered players statues of the games’ starter Pokémon and others like the mythical Shaymin event back in February. Now, it’s time for a new Mystery Gift and this time, it’s a member card for the mythical Darkrai. However, in order to get it, you’ll need to have reached the endgame of the remakes.

“The Member Card item will be given as a gift between Friday, April 1 and Sunday, May 1, 2022 at 11:59 p.m. (JST),” an official blog post reads. “After obtaining the item by selecting ‘Get via Internet’ from the Mystery Gift feature in-game and fulfilling specific conditions – such as entering the Hall of Fame and obtaining the National Pokédex – players will be able to go to Newmoon Island, where the Mythical Pokémon Darkrai can be found.” 
As noted above, if you’re wanting to get Darkrai in the Sinnoh remakes, you’ll need to act fast as the Darkrai Mystery Gift Member Card is live for less than a month at this point. Be sure to pick it up before May 1 to add it to your Pokédex. 
For more about Pokémon, read about Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, which are coming to Switch in “late 2022.” After that, check out our running list of every Pokémon confirmed for Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer’s review of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.

Elden Ring has been out for less than two months and already, it’s received a number of updates and patches to add additional NPC quest steps, new NPC icons on the in-game map, nerfs and buffs to popular weapons and abilities, and more. 
In an update last month, infamous boss Starscourge Radahn was nerfed. Some of his attacks were less frequent, it seemed, but more noticeably, his attacks didn’t do near as much damage as pre-patch Radahn. However, it turns out this nerf was unintentional because in a new update out today, From Software calls it a bug that’s now been fixed. 
Click here to watch embedded media
“Fixed a bug in the balance adjustment of the boss ‘Starscourge Radahn’ in update 1.03, in which the power of some attacks was unintentionally reduced,” the patch notes read. 
As you can see, From Software is very clearly referring to the Radahn nerf as unintentional and also a bug that was never meant to occur. We haven’t yet fought Radahn since this update, but we’re excited (and scared) to see what the fight is like now. 
It’s important to note that today’s update is an update to a previously-released patch: Patch 1.03. As a result, this update does not do anything else for Elden Ring – it simply fixes the Radahn balance and that’s it. For reference, Patch 1.03 was released in March and this update is live as of today, April 4, 2022. 
For more about Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring Beginner’s Guide, which features nine essential tips and tricks for new players, and then check out this guide on how to beat every boss in Elden Ring easily. Read about these unused Elden Ring files that seemingly point to a cut in-game bestiary after that.

In collaboration with lifestyle and gaming organization PWR, Byte will be introduced first to the metaverse, with its real and drinkable version coming in limited quantities in May. The virtual version of Byte will come first to an "individually created Fortnite Creative experience" called Pixel Point. This island created by PWR features four "sensory inspired multiplayer mini-games" named The Castle, The Escape, The Race, and The Tower. Pixel Point and the promotion of Byte have no official connection to Fortnite or Epic Games.
To try out Pixel Point right now, enter this Fortnite Creative code: 8565-0287-3178
Additionally, an augmented reality game can be accessed at the Coca-Cola Creations site that will feature a virtual leaderboard to compare completion times on social media.
Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte will be available in very limited quantities starting on May 2 and can be purchased through the Coca-Cola Creations site. Byte will be packaged in 12-ounce cans and sold in packs of two, which Coca-Cola says one is for consuming while the other can be safely collected. The release of Byte follows the release of a flavor called Starlight, and Coca-Cola promises more limited-edition Creations throughout the year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best of the last month's eShop games!
This year is certainly moving along, and as we head into Spring (for you Northern Hemisphere readers) we can reflect on more excellent recent eShop titles. This month's voting in the team was intriguing, and we've been left with three excellent games.
These awards aim to celebrate the best of Nintendo's digital store, giving some love and attention to the games that could so easily be missed in the Switch's ever-growing download library. It's worth noting we've focus on download-only games and not expansions / DLC, so the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass Wave 1 was not included. It was also a month with quite a few notable retail games, but of course this is all about eShop games.

If you were a fan of Dan Fornace's Smash-like 2D fighter Rivals of Aether, you might want to keep an eye out for Aether Studios' next project Rivals 2. It's a 3D-style sequel to the original game and is currently targeting a 2024 release. At the moment, no systems have been confirmed, but the aim is to release it on as many platforms as possible.
While competitive play will be the main focus during development, the team says it's laying the foundations to create an "amazing single player" experience. As for the mechanics, the second game will be taking inspiration from other platform fighters by introducing shields, grabs and ledges. Many of the same mechanics will also be returning. You can learn more on the official Rivals 2 FAQ page.

Now that Season 3 of Video Gameography is complete, and the Uncharted series has been, well...charted, we're diving below the depths and soaring above the clouds to spotlight the Bioshock series in Season 4. This week we're putting on the diving suit and exploring Bioshock 2. 
Bioshock 2 launched in February 2010 with developer 2K Marin, led by former Irrational employees who departed the studio after Bioshock 1's release, given barely two years to follow-up one of the best games ever. Bioshock level designer Jordan Thomas sat in the creative director's chair for the sequel, a major promotion that proved challenging both artistically and mentally for the rookie leader. We discuss the original premise of the Big Sister, the game's more action-oriented approach, as well as how its acclaimed Minerva's Den expansion led to the founding of indie studio Fullbright. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Video Editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and narrative of Bioshock's sophomore outing!
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Some games, like The Sims and Animal Crossing, draw you in with their comfortable routine, easing you into the mechanics and letting you make the experience your own. The Rune Factory series exemplifies this gameplay style, blending farming, socializing, and dungeon crawling.
As someone who has played the franchise since the Story of Seasons spin-off’s first entry 15 years ago, I’ve always loved how the action/RPG captures a sense of discovery.

The top half boasts a 14-inch 4K touchscreen. A full keypad and trackpad occupy the bottom half.

This news comes by way of Atari CEO Wade Rosen, who, from the still-under-construction balcony of his favorite Atari Hotel room, live-streamed the announcement by saying “Booya, baby, booya, booya, booya.” It was unclear why Rosen said this, but shortly after, Ata…]]></summary>

Rivals 2 jumps to detailed 3D models, a huge visual change from the 16-bit inspired sprites from the original. The footage shown looks gorgeous, showing HUD-less gameplay of three Rivals duking it out. Fiery lion Zetterburn, the wind wielder Wrastor, and the poisonous frog martial artist Ranno all make their return and have plenty of screentime showing off their updated looks and moves.

While new characters weren't shown in the trailer, new mechanics were. Those who are familiar with Super Smash Bros. may be very comfortable with the additions. Shields are being added as a defensive mechanism, as well as grabs to counter them. Also, "throws look cool," says an FAQ answer for why they've been added to the game. More nuanced questions and answers for changes being made to the combat in Rivals 2 can be found on the game's FAQ page.
Rivals 2 isn't expected to release until 2024, according to Aether Studios, but does plan to hold a closed beta sometime next year. The original Rivals of Aether is currently available on Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

The thesis of TIG's video, opened with a paragraph from Diana Athill's 2009 memoir, Somewhere Towards the End, which fades from the screen too quickly for the reader to finish, is such: "In Sifu, as you progress through the game, you get older and older. And also, you're in a country: China. Which, given the number of people you must fight in Sifu, you might say, is …" At this point, TIG lowers his voice to nearly a whisper to emphasize his point but mostly sounding creepy.

A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Mona…]]></summary>

At the end of the side quest Honest Debt, you convince a man to either spare or gun down a rather horrible chap who wronged him greatly. There’s nothing particularly remarkable about that - I’ve encountered the same thing dozens of times in games - but what comes after is a real doozy.
Not content simply with nudging the fella into giving in to his worst impulses, I then proceeded to persuade him to wipe the very memory of his nemesis from the galaxy, up to and including hunting down his friends and family members. Bastilla Shan, noted Jedi do-gooder, pointed out that neither she nor the Jedi council would approve. I was giggling like a schoolgirl.

Firstly, that Kojima's bonkers hiking postal sim is still one of the best open world games around. If you haven't read my full thoughts on the new Director's Cut, please do consider having a gander. The second most important thing is that Death Stranding's photo mode remains just glorious, brilliant fun, and it therefore felt appropriate, nay, necessary to give my good old BB Boys another trip for the album.

Patch 6.1 of Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is just two weeks away, and in today's Letter from the Producer Live presentation, Square Enix revealed the trailer for the upcoming content. 
Titled "Newfound Adventure," the footage shown from the new quests, raids, and other content is refreshingly adventurous, especially after spending an entire expansion on saving the world and more from threats that have been building since the outset of Final Fantasy XIV in 2010. Now that those worries are behind us, it's going to feel nice to go on some light-hearted escapades.

My wife left me three weeks ago.
I was heartbroken, completely taken aback – it truly came as a surprise. How did I end up here? Why had she decided to leave me? I know she mentioned something a few weeks ago about me not being present or something like that, but I can’t seem to recall what she said. Regardless, life hasn’t been the same since. 
There’s a flame that shines in this eternal darkness I now feel, though: the light of the fire that burns atop Needle Kane’s head in Twisted Metal Black. I’m trying to work through all the ways I failed as a partner in marriage, but it’s Twisted Meta…]]></summary>

By comparison, April 2022 almost seems a little light when it comes to new PC releases. Only one AAA blockbuster launching this month? How quaint. 


Still, this relatively quiet period finally gives indie games a chance to breathe again. There are a ton of super interesting, smaller titles launching on PC this month that I’m excited to share with you all today. From epic turn-based RPGs based on English mythology to offbeat walking simulators about free will, there’s something for everyone launching on PC this month.

Popular Gran Turismo 7 streamer, LifeIsAHighway79, has seemingly been canceled after a disturbing discovery that he plays Forza Horizon 5 in his off-time. 
LifeIsAHighway79, otherwise known as John Jacobs William, was finishing up a 13-hour stream of Gran Turismo 7 –  where each time he lost a race he explained that the game was busted and “buggy as hell” – when he told his viewers that he needed to take a break and eat some “chicky nuggies” heavily dipped in BBQ sauce. 
William told his audience that he’d be back in about an hour to stream the same race he had lost multiple times in earlier and…]]></summary>

For example, there's probably a generally accepted term for RPGs about traipsing around dungeons killing rats, while turning and moving strictly at 90 degree angles. But I actually typed out "Dungeons of Gridlock" because I genuinely thought that's what Legend Of Grimrock was called. For once, I am not trying to annoy fans of a thing I generally hate.
That's because I've been playing Potato Flowers In Full Bloom, which is very much one of those games. And it’s the first I’ve ever enjoyed.

We know April Fools' Day makes it tough to trust any game-related announcements since they'll likely be fake (not that our hands are clean either), but here's a gag that's actually legit. Innersloth is getting in on the fun by turning an old joke into a reality: Among Us Horse Mode.
For today only, this free update twists Among Us' crewmates into galloping four-legged versions of themselves. The idea stems from a screenshot of the then-hypothetical concept tweeted last April, posted below. 
what if pic.twitter.com/iXZPdyrIyF
April 16, 2021
More than just a visual gag, these space-faring stallions come complete with a "neigh" sound effect recorded by one of Innersloth's programmers and a unique Imposter kill animation. Horses can only wear visors and hats, however. If you're still wary, I booted up Among Us myself and can confirm this is a real thing.

Innersloth says Horse Mode will disappear on April 2 at midnight UTC, which translates to today at 8 p.m. ET. So if you're feeling horsey (whatever that means), you'll want to wrangle some friends to jump on this sooner than later.]]></summary>

Coming in patch version 1.05, players exploring Liurnia of the Lakes will soon find oversized bipedal biscuit monsters roaming alongside the giant lobsters already terrorizing the area. These lip-smacking foes attack by pulling off pieces of themselves to lob at the player. When hit, your character is inflicted with the “hungry” status ailment, making them halt to obsessively devour the giant crumb. This leaves them vulnerable to attack by the bone-crushing lobsters, making them a deliciously deadly duo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s battery life isn’t one of its best qualities. While this weakness is outweighed by the pleasures of playing PC games in bed or on the bus, most such games will drain the Deck quickly, requiring a degree of foresight if you want to entertain yourself on a long trip away from mains power. At the same time, different games will drain at different speeds, with some allowing Valve’s handheld to last hours longer than others.


Ultimately, I think the only truly accurate way to measure and judge the Steam Deck’s battery life is to test a bunch of different games to see how long it lasts with each. So I have! Here you’ll find a list of games with how long they took to empty the Deck’s battery from full. I’ll be coming back and adding more to the list as I test them, so you can see for yourself what uptimes to expect from your favourites.

In fact, this is the 16th consecutive year we've collaborated with him on this project. 
To celebrate such a long history, I got together with Zander, my colleague Ben Reeves, and former GI editor Jeff Cork to take a stroll down memory lane.

In poorer moments, it falls into the trap of the sketch show, flogging a perfectly fine jokehorse to the point of putrefaction. In richer moments, it flips your expectations with a huge scene-changing gag that solicits a hearty giggle. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is more mix for the bag. It's a loots-be-shoot with a moreish loop urging you onward, boasting characterful art design and thick-lined scenery goading you to pause for yet another snap in photo mode. For Borderlikers, the gun compulsion and farty japes will be enough. It exists as a handsome world to roam through with pals, half-listening to dialogue while Paula chews toast and Jeremy complains about work. As that, Tinalands is fine. It is also 100% not for me.

You can refresh the 90s vibes of Rachel & Monica's flat, and make Chandler & Joey's flat at least somewhat resemble a place fit for human habitation. I approve of this April Foolishness.

It's a pretty big leap from their usual fare, but based on a 40 minute demo I got to play this week, it's worked out a treat. There's a hint of Sekiro in there, with katana clashing combat, combined with a mysterious story that has me itching to know more. This is rare for someone like me, who often cares more for the action than the characters. Hey, keep an eye on this one.

Metroid is easily one of Nintendo’s underrated top-tier franchises; entries come few and far between compared to Mario, Zelda, and even Splatoon these days. It’s a series that rarely misses, with each entry ranging from a fun romp that’s worth playing to a consistently great experience than can be considered one of the greatest games of all time. Metroid has inspired an entire genre of games that mix platforming, action, discovery, and abilities unlocking even more options for the previous three pillars, and it even remains at the peak of that archetype in its latest entries. The mark Metroid has …]]></summary>

One of the (many) talking points around the game was its art style, and the perception that Blizzard had made the art style lighter and friendlier versus the gothic greys of the previous two games. The criticism seemed a little overblown and silly at the time, but here we are reading the latest quarterly update on the development of Diablo 4. It focuses on the new game's art, and the phrase "return to darkness" is used repeatedly.

"Excited to share that @SummerGameFest will return this June with a slate of events. We'll be producing another Kickoff Live show with announcements, news and first looks. Much more to share in the coming weeks, along with some very cool new elements for '22."
Summer Game Fest began in 2020 and was created in combination due to the cancelation of that year's E3 Expo along with growing frustrations with the trade show in previous years. Keighley now partners with developers and publishers to show up an upcoming slate of games, featuring new looks at titles and world premiere reveals in various digital showcases throughout the summer months.
There's no word on who will show up this year for Summer Game Fest, but the scope of the event will likely become clear in the coming months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 has been completely canceled this year, IGN reports with further confirmation by VentureBeat.  
In a statement to VentureBeat, the Entertainment Software Association, which organizes E3, said the following:
"We previously announced that E3 would not be held in person in 2022 due to the ongoing health risks surrounding COVID-19. Today, we announce that there will also be no digital E3 showcase in 2022."
The ESA announced in January that a physical convention would not take place but an online-only version was still a possibility. Today's news broke when IGN’s Rebekah Valentine confirmed the contents of an email sent to Razor PR lead Will Powers, who tweeted that it stated a digital E3 was no longer happening as well. It appears these emails were sent to all of the ESA’s partners prior to the announcement. 
There has not been an in-person E3 since 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 show was also canceled and the 2021 iteration was an online event consisting of trailers and digital booths for media. However, many publishers either declined to participate or appeared in Geoff Keighley’s Summer Games Fest, making E3 2021 a shallow disappointment to fans and the press. 
It's likely due to the 2021 show's reception that the ESA also tells VentureBeat that it plans to "revitalize" E3 in 2023 as "a reinvigorated showcase that celebrates new and exciting video games and industry innovations."

Heart Machine, the development studio behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash has revealed its next project titled Hyper Light Breaker.
Breaker, which was announced on G4 this afternoon, is a new game set within the Hyper Light universe, where players will enter early access next year. Unlike Drifter, Breaker will be a 3D action title with cooperative gameplay. According to creative director Alx Preston, this new adventure is not a direct sequel to Drifter.

The Steam page for Hyper Light Breaker offers this description for the game:

You can watch the debut trailer above, which sets the stage with a stylish, action-packed animated sequence and ends with a splash of a look at the game in-engine.

Alice Bee is away this week, adapting to life in a brand-new country, leaving Nate and Matthew to dwell on the merits of The Mandalorian, and whether a show following the life of a Halo grunt would be better than big flashy Master Chief quips.
Matthew puts forward the idea of a Hitman TV show in the vein of Succession, focusing not on Agent 47, but the elite corporate villains he assassinates, as they deal with various cast members being offed in mysterious circumstances. Nate, meanwhile, wants to go all-in on a Dungeon Keeper sitcom, and The Office-like monster relationships therein.

Thankfully, the delay is a short one. The show now begins Friday, May 27. In a video announcing the update, the man himself, Ewan McGregor, dropped the bonus news that the series’ first two episodes will be available to watch on day one.

Obi-Wan Kenobi fills the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope by following the Jedi Master’s exploits on Tatooine while keeping an eye on a young Luke Skywalker. He’ll confront all manner of threats from the Dark Side, including the live-action debut of Imperial Inquisitors and the big bad himself, Darth Vader, played by a returning Hayden Christensen. 
The rest of the cast includes Moses Ingram, Joel Edgerton, Bonnie Piesse, Kumail Nanjiani, Indira Varma, Rupert Friend, and O’Shea Jackson Jr., among other names. Disney bills Obi-Wan Kenobi as a “limited series,” suggesting it will only consist of a single season. You can watch the debut trailer here.]]></summary>

2022 is shaping up to be a noteworthy year for Vampire: The Masquerade fans. In addition to the May 19 launch of the narrative RPG Swansong, we now know that Bloodhunt, the free-to-play battle royale, will exit Early Access and launch in full on April 27.
The game first entered Steam Early Access last September, and 1.0 launch means Bloodhunt is also coming to PlayStation 5. The third-person shooter unfolds in Prague and pits players in the roles of vampires against each other. You can play alone or squad up with friends to take on opposing players as well as AI-controlled adversaries. Your supernatural abilities are determined by whichever of the six vampire clans you align yourself with. No matter what side you choose, players use vampiric powers to climb and run along walls and drain blood from victims to increase health and boost powers. Or you can just mow targets down with guns, crossbows, and other firearms. That works too.

Bloodhunt supports cross-play between PS5 and PC. The PS5 version boasts features such as Tempest 3D audio, adaptive trigger feedback, and smaller perks such as the DualSense light displaying the color of your faction. Although the game is free, you can pre-order a special Founders Edition for $59.99 that includes the following bonuses: 
PS5 exclusive Samurai Mask
PS5 exclusive Headrush and Fast Forward outfits
Over 100 cosmetic items
1,000 tokens for the in-game store

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo meets The Boys is the four-word elevator pitch of Stitch Heads and Raw Fury's new isometric hack and slasher - and judging from the amount of loot, blood and minced limbs I saw in my hands on demo last week, I'd say they're pretty bang on the money, albeit with an extra dash of Borderlands thanks to its cel-shaded comic book visuals. Whichever way you slice it, though, Superfuse makes a striking and violent first impression. 
Perhaps it's because I'm playing as its Berserker class, a large walking slab of man muscle whose axe and (comically large) fists can pulverise anything and everything standing in its way. Or maybe it's because the devs have given me free rein of the game's extensive skill tree, letting me pile in dozens of points into attacks, abilities and power-ups normally reserved for later on. Superfuse may be a loot-driven hack and slash with hundreds of different weapons and armour components to pick from, but its skill tree is equally vast, giving you as much flexibility in how your attacks play out onscreen as your various wardrobe choices - and some of its effects are deliciously gory.

It’s a concise expression of everything the town’s been through: the rampaging bandits, the cannibal kidnappings, the swirling tornados. Filling the graveyard has been a solemn bid for order in the wake of so much chaos.
It’s not that way in Bripton, the next town over. The graveyard there is uncannily empty, save for a similarly bare tree. But you can change that, should you so choose: shoot up the bank or fight a duel and, the next time you return to that settlement, new plots will have appeared for every life snuffed out. Weird West even suggests you head to the local cemetery to loot any bodies you’ve missed - though its reputational system implies you should ensure nobody’s watching first.

Weird West is a spellbinding, isometric portrayal of the Wild West. From the minds behind Dishonored and Prey, this compelling immersive sim is unlike any western tale you’ve experienced. Its macabre frontier isn’t just a land of cowboys and cattle but one brimming with old magic and hideous monstrosities like werewolves, flesh-eating sirens, gold-hungry zombies, and bewitched trees capable of trapping the souls of men. 
The game’s main narrative is a five-chapter anthology following the lives of five “heroes”…]]></summary>

Access to some payment systems has been lost following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, so the devs say if you can't figure out a way to buy it, hey, just download it. The route-building dungeon-crawler's publishers, Devolver Digital, have supported this.

Bouncing around an arena and carving demons into hunks of meat gets a bit repetitive for my tastes. Which is weird! I love FPS games and repetitive things, like dying in Hades over and over again.
I'm into Nightmare Reaper because it's repetitive... but not. It's a roguelike DOOM-inspired shooter where you blast through procedurally-generated levels and their demonic denizens, earn cash, put points into a skill-tree, and get as far as you can. The quest for loot has elevated this from a potential "Meh" to a solid, "Oh yeah".

Admittedly, it'd take very little for me to be on board with a Death Stranding Director's Cut. It only needed to be more Death Stranding for me to be sold on revisiting Hideo Kojima's latest vanity project. Luckily for me, that's exactly what the Director's Cut is. I love the original release, and this is a perfect excuse to dive back in. I think you should play it, too. But maybe not for the reasons you think.

March 30, 2022
The developer took to Twitter today, where it posted a new trailer announcing the release date of Ultra Deluxe, which is coming on April 27. The trailer starts like a bland corporate training video and gets intense in a hasty fashion.
A video explains Stanley's place at the company where he works, pressing buttons on a computer all day. Then the camera zooms out to the player's perspective, who runs into the hall revealing endless rooms with the same video projected onto screens. The trailer's tone gets more frantic as the camera moves into a maintenance room, whipping around to different points of interest before arriving at a painted brick wall and a handwritten sign that reads, "Welcome back Employee 427!" You can check out the trailer for yourself above.
Initially announced in 2018, The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe marks the first time the game will be playable on consoles. This expanded and enhanced version will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC when it releases next month.

Blizzard Entertainment released a Diablo IV Quarterly Update yesterday, and several devs chimed in on what the upcoming open-world RPG will offer players. Recently-appointed game director Joe Shely voiced that Diablo IV will be "an immersive world you can wander through and enjoy getting lost in." These words held even more weight when art director of environments Brian Fletcher and lead exterior environment artist Matt McDaid added that Sanctuary (the game world/mortal realm) boasts five explorable regions with over 150 dungeons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[House of the Dragon, the prequel series to Game of Thrones centered on House Targaryen, premieres on August 21, HBO announced on Twitter today. 
The 10-episode series, which will only be streamed through HBO Max, is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, when the Targaryens were still in power. However, House of the Dragon centers on the inner turmoil that led to their downfall, particularly a civil war known as the Dance of Dragons. The show draws partial inspiration from author George R.R. Martin’s 2018 book Fire & Blood.  
The cast includes Matt Smith (Prince Daemon Targaryen), Olivia Cooke (Lady Alicent Hightower), Paddy Considine (King Viserys I Targaryen), and Emma D’Arcy (Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen). Writer and producer Ryan J. Condal (Rampage, Colony) and George R.R. Martin serve as principal showrunners.
You can watch House of the Dragon’s first trailer, which premiered last October, here.

Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus were two of the best JRPGs of 2021 (if you're a fan of the genre, you should also go play Nier Replicant!). Leading up to its release, Arise was slated as the definitive 25th Anniversary Tales game touting a more expansive game world than previous entries and an engine switch that would boost the series' graphical capabilities. Scarlet Nexus, on the other hand, was a surprise hit with fun telekinetic abilities and fast-paced combat. Today, Bandai Namco is celebrating its 2021 success stories with a free, stylish crossover event for both games.

If you'd like to see the incoming cosmetic items in action, watch the trailer above. Both games are getting three equipable items and a music track:
Tales of Arise
Myoho Muramasa Replica
Handmade Hairclip Replica
Baki
BGM: Opposed Viewpoint
Scarlet Nexus
Blazing Sword
Broken Iron Mask
Owlet Doll
BGM: Flame of Hope
Last year, we enjoyed playing both games. I awarded Tales of Arise a 9.25 and wrote, "Tales of Arise is a fantastic reinvention of Bandai Namco’s tried and true formula. It might even be the best installment in the franchise to date." 
Dan Tack gave Scarlet Nexus an 8.75 and concludes his review by saying, "Whatever brainpunk’s take on over-the-top psychic reality is, I’m into it now. Bandai Namco has crafted something truly strange and quite satisfying with Scarlet Nexus, and I hope we get a slightly more refined sequel."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a strange thing, returning to the world of Death Stranding after more than a year away. Having done that classic thing of rinsing almost every last delivery out of it before finally strapping myself in for its rollercoaster ending back in 2020, there hasn't been much reason to return to my precious, daft BB Boys in the intervening months - not even its Cyberpunk 2077 crossover was enough to tempt me back. At long last, though, I have cause to load up the BB train again. Death Stranding Director's Cut arrives on Steam and the Epic Games Store today, bringing with it new story missions, new delivery buddies, new weapons and... a Mario Kart-style race track? Yep, that sounds like a classic Kojima upgrade pack, if you ask me. Not quite as revolutionary as Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, mind, but it's roughly in the same kind of ballpark. 
It's been great fun revisiting the lush mountains of Death Stranding's definitely not Icelandic version of post-apocalyptic America. If anything, the weirdest thing is seeing that same world I know and love on a fresh server, bereft of all the distracting neon signs, yelps of "Keep on keeping on!" and one-upmanship bridge-building that made up the bulk of the original's asymmetric online multiplayer component. It's actually quite refreshing to see these virgin, unspoiled landscapes again, although I imagine this won't last long once returning players flock back to their well-worn delivery routes. As for the new new stuff, is it worth making a return trip? As with all expando games, the answer will very much depend on if and how much you played the first one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of rumours, Sony have finally unveiled their answer to Xbox Game Pass today. Starting this June, their new subscription service will unite PlayStation Plus and their cloud streaming platform PlayStation Now under one roof, offering three different tiers of membership. Most of it isn't that relevant to us on PC, but the final, most expensive tier, PlayStation Plus Premium, will include that aforementioned cloud streaming to PC, letting us play hundreds of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PSP games without having to own an actual PlayStation.
It's not yet clear how that library of games will differ from the current PlayStation Now library, but one thing is certain: this is a move that definitely benefits people with a PlayStation and a PC more than it does standalone PC peeps. And yet, even as someone who falls into the former camp of PlayStation and PC owners, I'm still not sure this new PS+ is something I actually want. Sure, there's that massive retro collection on offer, but no Day One games I can either play on my console or stream to PC? On your bike, Sony. Personally, I see this as more of a dip-in and dip-out kinda deal to indulge my occasional retro cravings, but I'm keen to know what you, RPS readers, think of this new PS Plus offering as well. Does it appeal in any shape or form? And how does it compare to Game Pass for you? Let's chat about it below.

I think the second mobile game I bought was probably one of its follow-ups, too. So I'm feeling all sorts of nostalgic as I see Game Dev Story and four other vintage Kairosoft manage 'em ups have arrived on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony today announced they're overhauling PlayStation Now, their subscription service which lets us play some older PlayStation games on PC via cloud gaming. They're merging it with their PlayStation Plus service and adding a giant library of games as some sort of multi-tiered mega-Game Pass doodad. It's not clear how exactly this will change things for people who are already using PS Now to play PlayStation games on PC, but it sounds like maaaybe they'll add Marvel's Spider-Man, at least? For now, they're vague about the whole thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There sure are a lot of “world’s fastest” gaming CPUs around these days. Just two weeks after AMD confirmed a date and price for their own champion, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, Intel have formally unveiled the Core i9-12900KS: a new addition to the 12th Gen Alder Lake lineup that promises superlative performance and up to 5.5GHz clock speeds.


That’s all less than five months since the launch of the original Intel Core i9-12900K, which as far as I can tell actually is the best CPU for gaming right now in pure performance terms. And the Core i9-12900KS is even set to beat the Ryzen 7 5800X3D to shelves, releasing on April 5th to the Ryzen’s April 20th street date. No brakes on the top-tier processor train, it seems.

Whew, that's a lot of parts smushed together, but think of it like a baby's first Hunt: Showdown. You're a Prospector, tasked with descending into Fortuna 3, an alien planet filled with minerals and plant matter and dinosaurs. Corpos hire you to get these goods and bring them back safely. The catch is other players and inconvenient helicopter schedules. Other Prospectors will murder you for your precious rocks and weeds, so your aim is to get a helicopter out of Fortuna before this happens. It's a setup where success breeds success in its current closed beta form, but failure also begets frustration. In the end, you might wish Fortuna was yours and yours alone.

In fact, it’s so much not a Borderlands game that it has almost identical visuals, PC system requirements and graphics options to Borderlands 3. The odds, right? Still, for seasoned fans of the loot shooter series, this does make the search for Wonderlands’ best settings a treading of comfortably familiar ground. Even if there are wizards this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It all started going wrong when I died taking on the old McDuckitt job. In Abermore, you play as a thief making a name for themselves in its titular city. Every day you wake up, leave your apartment and hit the streets, chatting to the locals, picking up a bit of info, even gambling a bit. The folks you meet are from the shadier side of society and they'll hire you for jobs. Sometimes it’s simple burglary, sometimes it's breaking a vase, or snatching a specific bit of loot. There’s even a guy who keeps trying to offer me wet work! It all boils down to the same thing though: sneaking around some rich guy’s place, disabling the security, avoiding or taking down the occupants, and getting out without being caught. Afterwards, I fence the loot and head to bed.
It's all building up to Abermore's central heist: The Feast of the Lucky Few. It's also my only chance to rescue the famous Hanged Man, a dame I met on the boat over here. They're the thief of thieves! A living legend! But the tyrant king grabbed her before we got ashore and she’ll be executed in eighteen days if I don’t break her out. That’s eighteen nights to prepare, eighteen jobs to build the resources, the connections I need for the heist of a life time. A terrible shame, then, that alarm bells started ringing almost as soon as I started playing.

It usually works very well, with the added benefit that I don't have to get on a plane anywhere. I had one of these for Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong last week, an upcoming thrillery-puzzley-investigation-RPG set in The World Of Darkness universe (aka all them vampy games), by Big Bad Wolf, who did The Council. For various reasons, however, my preview went terribly. But if it had gone well, I probably wouldn't be as excited for Swansong as I now am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The four-sided heroes of Patrick's Parabox and Wilmot's Warehouse would be great friends, I think. They both specialise in the placement and movement of boxes, and they both share the same cheery disposition. Sure, Patrick may not have the same pointy nose or cheeky smile of his mate Wilmot, but the way his eyes rove from side to side as he wiggles to the beat of Priscilla Snow's meditative and upbeat electronic soundtrack is surely a sign of someone who is truly in love with what they do. 
If anything, I reckon Wilmot would be a wee bit jealous of Patrick. You see, in Patrick's line of work, his cubes contain multitudes, to misquote that famous Walt Whitman line. As long as they're resting against a hard surface, cubes can be packed into other cubes in Patrick's Parabox like a stack of matryoshka dolls. They can also be unpacked in the same way, allowing him to navigate the tight constraints of his respective puzzle arenas with surprising dexterity. It's like he's discovered the TARDIS of sokoban-style cube-pushing, if you will, and cor, just imagine what Wilmot could do with such technology. That warehouse would be immaculate.

Announced this week, Turbo Golf Racing looks to change that. It's a multiplayer game about driving a car into a ball, but as the name suggests it's drawing inspiration from those ruined good walks rather than from football.

After spending far, far too long trying to obsessively control every detail of Distant Worlds 2, I've accepted that I need to take my own advice and work with its macromanagement systems instead. They are, after all, the reason its ludicrous scale is workable at all beyond the opening hours, and a major reason its predecessor was so interesting and forward-thinking to begin with. But they are also a source of great friction and confusion, especially if you don't take the time to learn how they actually work.
Distant Worlds 2 is, ultimately, a game that you need to meet in the middle. Consequently, it's one that I can only partially recommend. But I really do recommend it for that part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since the very first trailer for Tunic appeared all the way back in 2017, my Zelda senses have been a-tingling. I'm always up for a good Zelda-like, and everything I saw of Tunic back then seemed to confirm that this was 100% a game I would like and enjoy. 
You can probably imagine my excitement, then, when Microsoft announced there would finally be a playable demo to people download during last year's E3. However, as I briefly mentioned in my post about Tunic's brilliant in-game instruction manual yesterday, I actually came away from that demo a bit disheartened. With just a single (and quite unforgiving) dungeon to explore, I was left thinking it hewed a bit too close to the Soulsian school of combat difficulty than I'd like. Upon playing the final game, however... Delight! Magic! Joy! I actually can't get enough of it. To think I almost dismissed what's now one of my early game of the year contenders on the basis of that one 20 minute demo now seems incredibly hasty on my part, but with so many games now being shoved down our throats on a daily basis, those first impressions can be devastatingly powerful.

Buggos is about driving your endless swarm of alien insects to spread across a newfound planet and wipe out the gross humans standing in the way.
There's very little stress and no need for detailed schemes, reflexes, or micromanaged tactics. As long as there is food, more buggos will come, and as long as there are buggos, they will loosely move in the direction you command, dying in droves but succeeding in aggregate. It's a good time that asks for little but a point to attack and a desire to consume everything in your path. I'm actually surprised at how much I want to keep playing it.

Because of some complicated Lego lore reasons, the only way to save the park is by helping people all around the world. How do you do that? By building increasingly complex contraptions of course.

In doing so, it becomes a more broadly accessible movie guessing game than Framed, and I'm enjoying it a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2019's Deliver Us The Moon was set in a future where Earth was dependent on its grey satellite for energy, and you were sent to the Moon to discover who'd unplugged the juice. There's now a sequel on the way. Deliver Us Mars takes place ten years after the events of the original, but should offer similar third-person sci-fi storytelling - only now with seemingly higher production values, and a red planet to explore.

If that wasn't enough, though, an hour later, Inscryption then won the Game Of The Year award at the Game Developers Choice Awards. It's the first time a game has ever won both awards in the same year, which is a stonking achievement. Clearly, our Advent Calendar made some pretty big waves this year. Just saying.

However, all this attention on playing up the difficulty, as usually is the case once we get into The Discourse, detracts from the fact that the game can also be hilariously easy.

This is in honour of Ghostwire: Tokyo, a game that Matthew played and reviewed for us, and one that has loads of bloody ghosts in it.
No update on Henry Cavill this week, but we talk a bit about Matthew's cursed trip to DisneyLand Paris, ways that Ghostbusters could take on a very different tone, and, once again, inject some serial killer energy into the podcast. Nate delivers a fun Cavern Of Lies where we have to guess which of the plots of terrible ghost games are made up. And for some reason I've written 'The Count of Monster Disco' in my notes. The reason escapes me. But it was probably funny.

Oh, but, teleporting me to the right map coordinates is fine, huh FromSoftware?!
There's already several creative ways to bother people online while playing Elden Ring, but as Ed points out, cosplaying Thanos was one of the more destructive ways. There was an exploit that hackers could use where they could teleport you to a void, trap you in an infinite death loop, and completely torpedo your save.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As several members of the RPS Treehouse can attest, I have not been able to stop playing Tunic this week. I was a little cautious going in, having not particularly gelled with the E3 demo from last year, but in hindsight, that early glimpse was nothing but the tip of a tiny fox nose peeking out of its burrow. In its full, regal splendour, Tunic has become an early game of the contender for me, and a large part of that is down to its wonderfully clever in-game instruction manual.
When Imogen (RPS in peace) interviewed Tunic dev Andrew Shouldice last September, they talked about how instruction manuals were a fundamental part of a game's design back in the days of the NES, and at one point he even pulled out his old instruction booklet for Zelda II: The Adventure Of Link to demonstrate some of the "tantalising hints" they'd offer to curious players. As Brendan (also RPS in peace) noted in our Tunic review, the in-game manual is indeed a critical part of what makes Tunic special, and the act of piecing it together page by page really does capture that feeling of discovering some great secret that only you and the dev team know about. But here's a secret between you and me: it's not by chance Shouldice pulled out that old Zelda II manual during our interview last year. His fox hero may be cut from the same cloth as Nintendo's green sword-swinger, but the art inside Tunic's instruction manual also pays a wonderful tribute to those Zelda booklets of yore, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent over 40 hours with Elden Ring and I’m still not very good at it. At this stage I’m less of a worthy Tarnished warrior on their way to be crowned the Elden Lord and instead more of a Mr. Bean type, accidentally succeeding through sheer incompetence alone. I can’t explain it, but my method of defeating Godrick had the same energy as Bean making a sandwich, in that I think the game eventually just took pity on me and let me win the fight to save me any further embarrasment.


I’m coming to terms with the fact I may never finish Elden Ring. I'm only in the second proper area, but I'm finding encounters to require a level of patience I simply don't possess. Its boss fights are simply too hard. But if I’m struggling this much at such an early stage, what else could Elden Ring possibly have to offer? What types of monstrosities lurk in the farthest reaches of the Lands Between, and how difficult are they to defeat? Spoilers, naturally, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think "platformer" and my next thought is "slick". Hollow Knight springs to mind, as does Ori, as does Celeste. They all have precise and snappy movement, with upgrades and new abilities that add complexity without stodge. As for 3D platformers, Super Mario 64 remains a glowing example of how movement makes exploration joyful. String together rolls and jumps and you're not just navigating a world, but bounding through it like a gymnast (who's also a part time plumber to help pay the costs of serious competition).
Elden Ring is a terrible platformer. It's stiff and awkward and less gymnast, more Gimli on the Buckfast. But this is what makes its platforming sections good. They force you to embrace your limited toolset and channel your amateur longjumping, golfing, and climbing skills you definitely don't have.

FSR 2.0 will represent a switch from simple spatial upscaling to more closely match the advanced temporal upscaling techniques of its rival, Nvidia DLSS – and while it won’t use DLSS-style machine learning, AMD say the trick to FSR 2.0’s improved performance is down to some good-old-fashioned human brainpower.

For £30.58, you can get almost a hundred games, and some books and software too. It's great value, but there's only one day left to buy it, so you should probably get a move on.

  As of today, the bundle's raised over £12 million pounds to help victims and refugees from the war in Ukraine, which is an amazing achievement. All of the proceeds are being split between four organisations providing relief efforts: Razom for Ukraine, International Rescue Committee, International Medical Corps, and Direct Relief.

From the hyper-detailed backstreets to giant blazing billboards bouncing off fresh rain puddles, this take on Tokyo is eye-catching enough to ditch the sidequests and simply spend some time strolling around. Even if that stroll is sometimes interrupted by rowdy gangs of yokai. 


In Matthew’s earlier preview, he noted a similarly evocative atmosphere to that of the YouTube channel Virtual Japan, which has featured one particularly calming walking tour through a rain-soaked Tokyo. Ghostwire has walking, and rain, and Tokyo, so when review code came in we thought we’d have a crack at making our own. And here it is, in 4K with maxed-out ray tracing:

Jim, Dave, and Sally all have their map markers in Vice City for a portion of the game, then they'll shift over to Tilted Towers after a few hours. Perhaps the bridge to Shrek's Swamp won't open unless you rescue the princess from Bowser's Castle later down the line.
And there's nothing wrong with an open world that gently steers you in the right direction. Elden Ring does this with its checkpoints that blow the equivalent of directional arrows in the breeze, helping you feel in control of your progress. But I'd argue it's even better at the opposite: wresting that control away in a split-second.
