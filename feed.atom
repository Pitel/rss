Ysbryd Games has announced that critically acclaimed creeper World of Horror is finally preparing to leave Early Access and unleash its brand of skin-crawling cosmic terror onto PC and console platforms. Originally expected to launch this summer, World of Horror will now arrive on October 19.
Opening its creaking doors in the winter of 2020, Panstasz' indie hit is an apocalyptic tale of demons, ghouls, and other ungodly abominations, slowly emerging throughout Japan's Shiokawa region. Utilizing a distinct visual style reminiscent of early Mac adventure titles, World of Horror tasks players with guide a party of characters through over 10 nightmarish mysteries, inspired by the works of authors H.P. Lovecraft and Junji Ito.

Since its arrival on Early Access, World of Horror has been praised by fans for its utterly unnerving atmosphere, simplistic but bizarrely frightening aesthetic, and moody chiptune soundtrack. Like many horror titles of the home computer age, World of Horror feels particularly unholy, with a sense of evil that permeates through the screen with effectiveness not even afford franchises such as Resident Evil. If you have a taste for the macabre, and are yet to check this dirty ditty out, then ensure that this release is sitting on your radar, ready for those long, dark, fall evenings.
World of Horror launches October 19 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It is available on PC via Early Access now.

The king of the harvest, and the longest-running farming sim series going, Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons has been a Nintendo stable since its 1996 debut on the SNES. And even if Stardew Valley (which was inspired by this very series) may have taken the crop coronet in recent years, the series remains ever-popular for its charm, its cosy vibes, and its addictive farming gameplay.
Known as Bokujō Monogatari in Japan, this lovely farming series sees budding young farmers build up a farm from scratch, raising animals, growing crops, and making sweet with the locals. You can fall in love, marry, have children, and take part in festivals.

A little over a week ago we heard that another wave of DLC would be coming to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe "soon", thus beginning our speculation about what courses will be heading our way this time. While we were all thinking about additions to the current game, however, some eagle-eyed viewers of The Super Mario Bros. Movie on Reddit have spotted what they believe to be a teaser for a whole new entry in the Mario Kart series.
As noted by AutomaticSir411 on the r/mariokart Reddit forum, the pipes on the top of the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing van have several codes on them, one of which reads "221203MK10500N". To some (AKA, us) this looked like nothing more than a series of numbers and letters, but AutomaticSir411 speculates that the concluding "MK10500N" might, in fact, signify that there is a 'Mario Kart 10' coming 'soon'. Hmm.

One game I played for literally half an hour and thought it was great, but I was not good enough to beat the first boss I came across. But I thought to myself, other people are better at Metroidvanias, and at least one of them might appreciate being nudged in the direction of a year old one I think is cute. Thus: Islets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prep your Evoker
The hopes of the Persona fan community continued to rise as ongoing evidence suggests Atlus is prepping a remake of the much-loved 206 release, Persona 3. While there have already been whispers that said remake was in the works, a new domain purchase by the publisher adds fresh fuel to the fire.
Atlus has recently updated the domain name "P3RE", which has led fans to believe that an announcement pertaining to a Persona 3 Remake or Persona 3 Reloaded is imminent. The "Reloaded" suffix would reference the controversial "Evoker" guns used by the characters in-game to travel to Tartarus, the mysterious, demon0filled world that exists within The Dark Hour.
Given the launch of Summer Game Fest today, there are several key presentations that could see Atlus make the grand reveal, including tonight's kick-off show, hosted by Geoff Keighley, and Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase. Of course, it should be iterated that the Persona 3 remake remains nothing more but speculation at this point. But given the overwhelming success of a simple PC port of Persona 4 Golden, it's easy to assess that a returning P3: FES — offered modern visuals and mechanics — would essentially be a license to print money.
Whether "P3R" shows up or otherwise, the Summer Game Fest stream kicks off today at 12:00 PT / 15:00 ET / 20:00 BST. We will bring you all of the news from the stream right here on Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had one question for Mask Of The Rose: Can I smooch the Cthulhu monster? I mean, I assume you can, they’re one of ten characters you’re able to romantically pursue in the delicious depths of this Eldritch dating sim. But in actuality, I simply don't know, because after ten-plus hours and multiple playthroughs, that all-important question remains unanswered. It’s not something unique to my dashing, tentacled suitor, either. Many of my romantic pursuits in the Neath totally fizzled out. It's giving Berocca when I wanted Coke and Mentos.
Mask Of The Rose is Failbetter’s visual novel dating sim set in the Fallen London universe, an already established alt-history Victorian London that the studio has been building over a decade as a quite excellent browser game. In this alternative history,  London has been dragged through the Earth’s crust by bats and now resides in a vast underground cavern called the Neath. With the economy literally in the pits and Queen Vicky refusing to leave her cushy palace, London has become somewhat unruly, turning into a lasciviously gothic underworld home to a whole parade of monsters, devils, living statues, cloaked beings with red eyes... basically the entire cast of the Goosebumps books.

In this recent video, 'The Basics of Pixel Art', Sakurai explains the, uhh, basics of pixel art — it's an accurate title, we'll give him that. At just under three minutes in length, this really is a whistle-stop tour of the art form, but it gives an interesting look into how something as simple as a circle can take on a multitude of different forms.

By now, pretty much any horror fan with a current-gen console or modern PC will have played the remake of Resident Evil 4. Capcom's reimagining of one of the best games in the series has sold millions of copies to date. It's pretty much become one of the most successful releases of 2023 so far.
However, if you haven't yet had a chance to give it a go, and you're in the market for a new graphics cards, you may be interested in an offer AMD is doing. The tech giant is currently giving away copies of the Resident Evil 4 remake. The catch, though, is you do have to purchase a Radeon RX GPU. The website gives a full list of the products that are included in the giveaway. Basically, it looks as though most things in the 6000 and 7000 series will net you a copy of the game.
[caption id="attachment_385035" align="aligncenter" width="1200"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]
The offer is on until July 1, and it doesn't end there, either. AMD says it's also offering up copies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Again, there's a slight catch. It's only free if you buy a Ryzen 7000 series CPU. As always with these types of giveaways, there are terms that need to be met. Check the footnotes on the AMD website to see what the full conditions are before you dive on in.
Arguably the most anticipated game of the year, Resident Evil 4 smashed Steam player records within moments of being released. Where Capcom is going to take its iconic survival horror series from here remains to be seen, but you can take part in a survey to let the studio know your thoughts.

Pokémon HOME's 3.0 update has been live for just over a week now. This update crucially added functionality with Pokémon Scarlet & Violet, but The Pokémon Company isn't quite done there.
Nintendo of America tweeted yesterday (via My Nintendo News) that players can change a Pokémon's moves when they bring a 'mon from HOME to a linked game. The move has to be from a list of moves it's learned up until that point, but it allows for a pretty big pool depending on what level your favourite creatures are.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!

It only feels like yesterday that we were getting geared up in preparation for last year's Summer Game Fest, yet here we are with Summer Game Fest 2023 - crazy, right?
Let's not dwell on the rapid passing of time, lest we fall into a deep well of existential crisis. Summer Game Fest 2023 is now the only overarching celebration of games over the month of June since E3 2023 was cancelled. Of course, companies like Microsoft and Ubisoft will showcase their upcoming slate of games on their own terms, but it certainly looks like Summer Game Fest is gearing up to supplant E3 as the go-to event over the course of the Summer. We'll be there this year, so look out for SGF-related features in the coming days.

Today we're righting that (minor) wrong, as we feature a 550W power supply slapped with a healthy $45 Amazon discount - bringing it down to $60. 
The PSU in question is the Cooler Master V550 Gold V2, an 80+ Gold rated unit with a semi-modular design that comes in a fetching white colourway. It's well-rated by reviewers and suitable for mid-range systems, and thanks to this limited time deal it's way cheaper than anything else similar on the market!

[One of the community's most dedicated fighting game fans, Virtua Kazama, prepared a few words for the departure of Capcom's Street Fighter V, a game which will be remained for its notorious launch and divisive gameplay, but also for creating great tournament moments and, ultimately turning its fortunes around. - Moyse]
Street Fighter V… where do I begin?
Seems just like yesterday when I wrote a blog about saying goodbye to SFIV, you came out with a rocky start. I remember back in 2016 while I was working at Best Buy that I got the game and played it despite how barebones the game came out. The game didn’t have a proper story mode until a few months later and that wasn’t good either. For the casual players, they didn’t get enough content, but …]]></summary>

The summer of video game announcements has begun. Guerrilla Collective Showcase 2023 has kicked off what looks to be a bonanza, and in the absence of E3 this year, Summer Game Fest will also be kicking off proceedings tomorrow.
But today, it's all about the indies. And Guerrilla showcased tons of stand-outs during its two-hour presentation-- which was also followed by the Publisher Spotlight Showcase. There were tons of announcements for Switch owners, and we've got 27 of them here for you. Some are brand-spanking new, while others are just updated trailers. But it looks like there's a lot to keep us busy for the rest of the year and beyond.

Anthology games are not my thing. I just can’t get into DreadX titles and prefer to take my short-form narrative experiences à la carte.

The overarching idea is that a buttload of developers all contributed short experiences that make up a choose-your-own-adventure. It’s like Give Yourself Goosebumps books, except sometimes it’s a disturbing version of animal crossing.
CHAINGED was organized by Andrew Pype and consists of a heaping helping of the HauntedPS1 Community. However, the real draw here is just how unhinged things can get. Each developer was only given the context of the games preceding theirs in the branch and wasn’t allowed to communicate with one another. The result is extremely …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pooh hole
Here’s something you probably could have lived without seeing. Twice Different is bringing us Winnie’s Hole, a game about mutating Winnie-the-Pooh with a horrific disease, to PC.
Yeah, that’s what I said. In Winnie’s Hole, you play as a virus within the silly bear, and your goal is to burrow through his body and capture cells to mutate. You need to “Refine his primitive form, adapt for survival, and do not let his friends contain you.” It’s grotesque.
https://youtu.be/DuD8G9GzOFw
Ugh. My goodness. Winnie’s Hole is the result of Winnie-the-Pooh slipping into the public domain. Predictably, this has led to a lot of people twisting the character in dark ways, such as the slasher flick Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey. It’s like Alice in Wonderland, it’s almost trite at this point.
At the same time, it’s effective, which might be why it’s so common. Twice Different could have created their own characters, but by applying the concept to something more beloved and well-known, you get something more disturbing.
There’s no way I’m playing Winnie’s Hole. It does some weird stuff to my empathy glands that just makes me uncomfortable. However, I do appreciate the unique concept, and I know multiple people in the Destructoid community who will be way into this. I’d bet five Canadian loonies that one of them will show up in the comments.
Winnie’s Hole is coming to PC via Steam. No release window has been announced.

Developer Batterystaple Games calls 30XX a "mega-roguelike", which should tell you everything you need to know. Visually inspired by Mega Man, 30XX comes with tailored difficulty settings and a brand new Maker Mode — which will allow you to make your own levels and comes from the man behind the Mega Man Maker fan project.

A September announcement tease from the publisher was accompanied with a press release stating that the difficult development of Bloodlines 2 marches on. Paradox had been silent on Bloodlines 2 for over a year after many troubling moves: it fired the game's lead writer, and its director, and subsequently moved all development duties to a still-unnamed development team. While all these shadowy machinations happening in the background fits thematically in a vampire-based series, fans were mostly left confused.

Cult adventure story Syberia is being adapted into a new animated series — The announcement was made by game publisher Microids and production company WHAT THE PROD, who will work together to see Benoit Sokal’s tales of exploration and mystery brought to life in a whole new medium.
While details are slim at this time, the animated series is expected to be a direct adaptation of the long-running adventure series, that began in 1999 with the release of PC adventure Amerzone, itself an adaptation of Sokal's 1986 comic-book series of the same name. In 2002, the first Syberia game was released for PC, PS2, and Xbox, following the escapades of explorer Kate Walker, as she journeys across Europe and into Russia in a tale of mystery and self-realization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the creator of the Remothered series.
We've seen visuals inspired by classic animated movies plenty of times, but rarely have the worlds of Disney-inspired and horror gone hand in hand. But Little Sewing Machine's new game, led by Remothered creator Chris Darril, brings the two worlds together to beautiful, unsettling effect.
Bye Sweet Carole is a horror adventure game inspired by "the greatest animation movies" where a young woman jumps into a world that's been infested by rabbits. Blending surreal and creepy vibes with a gorgeous world, Bye Sweet Carole looks to unsettle players with this potent and unusual blend.

A Street Fighter 6 treadmill streamer has impressed fighting game enthusiasts worldwide on social media. Twitter user @thatMarcWithaC uploaded video Monday of the streamer, known as TalesofMrE, playing SF6 online while walking on a treadmill with his fight stick.
The British streamer has straps around his shoulders to keep it in place as he walks forward. What makes this even more impressive is that TalesofMrE achieved a Perfect K.O. while playing Zangief in this setup.
[caption id="attachment_384792" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Screenshot via TalesofMrE's Twitch channel[/caption]
Playing with a Street Fighter 6 treadmill setup
With almost 1,000 followers on Twitch, TalesOfMrE took his treadmill setup online in pursuit of the prestigious Diamond rank. He said he "almost tripped" during his June 5 stream but the streamer still managed to defeat his opponent, accompanied by an evil laugh. While the wire of his fight stick looks hazardously close, TalesofMrE notes that "the perspective of the camera makes it look a lot closer to [his] legs than in reality."
https://twitter.com/thatMarcWithaC/status/1665807673093242881
TalesofMrE eventually achieved Diamond rank, one of the highest ranks you can get in Street Fighter 6, sitting just under Master. Getting a decent workout and playing a superb Street Fighter experience sounds like a lot of fun. Still, succeeding in fighting games at that level requires plenty of concentration and precision, making this feat even more impressive.
When not fighting it out online with bizarre control setups, TalesofMrE also works in the FGC as a community manager at Square Enix!

Updated with multiple new entries, including Puzzle Bobble Everybubble and Tin Hearts. Enjoy!

From the very beginning, Nintendo handhelds have been a powerhouse in the puzzle genre, championing games that might have been lost in the bombastic, graphics-obsessed arena of home consoles. Switch’s bridging of the portable/home console divide means it upholds that proud puzzling tradition and gives on-the-go gamers a chance to dive deeper than ever before into the ever-addictive world of puzzlers.

Dotemu and Tribute Games have announced that hit arcade beat-’em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is getting DLC in the form of Dimension Shellshock. It will be coming later this year. According to my watch, it is 2023.
The key feature of the Dimension Shellshock DLC is the inclusion of Usagi Yojimbo (which literally means Rabbit Bodyguard in Japanese). Usagi was the star of his own comic book but frequently crossed over with the turtles. I mostly know Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from playing the games, and I’m not sure I’ve ever watched an episode of its various cartoons or watched a movie.
I watched The Real Ghostbusters as a child, and I was already a bit too young for that.

It's a parallel universe where forgotten items, known as forgotlings come to life and endeavour to be remembered again. This new game, due out in 2024, is actually called Forgotlings, and you play as one called Fig in a similarly actiony platformy adventure in a 2D "semi open-world Metroidvania". Fig is, by the way, an artist's wooden posing doll, and even though he has a head his face is in his torso. I find this greatly distressing and will not stand for it.

In the latest million-dollar handshake between gaming and branding, Coca-Cola has announced that it is partnering with Riot Games to produce a limited edition variant of its soda, themed after the studio's juggernaut MOBA League of Legends.
The "Ultimate Coca-Cola Zero Sugar" drink is part of the corporation's "Creations" line, which has seen the drink-maker partner with various brands and personalities to produce exclusive, limited-time variants of the beverage. Previous campaigns have seen cans branded by artists Mashmello, Rosalia, and Ava Max — none of whom I'm aware of because I'm way, way too old.

"This collaboration with Riot Games allows us to continue elevating the Coca-Cola Creations platform with a brand new flavour that reinforces our shared mission to put fans and players at the forefront of everything we do," said Oana Vlad, Senior Director of Global Strategy. "Coca-Cola Ultimate, our seventh Coca-Cola Creation, carries an astonishing design, unlocks the taste of +XP for players on their journey and enhances their gameplay experience."
So, the big question... What does XP taste like?
"We’re never really going to answer that question in a 'straightforward' way," added Vlad, "They’re mystery flavors. The flavor profile is always, we say, 85 to 90% Coke. And then that 10 to 15% twist of something unexpected."
I'm guessing that the "taste of XP" is surprisingly similar to the taste of Acesulphame Potassium.
Over the coming weeks, LoL players should look out for specially themed Coca-Cola missions in-game, that can be completed in order to unlock exclusive "Ultimate" emotes. Additionally, players can scan the QR code on the can to access special Instagram filters and fucking hell I'm so old.
Ultimate Coca-Cola Zero Sugar launches in North America this week.

Pathea Games' long-awaited follow-up to My Time at Portia has finally got a console launch date: My Time at Sandrock will be coming to Switch (and other consoles such as the *checks notes* Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xboxes) on Tuesday 26th September 2023.
The game has been in Early Access on Steam since May 2022 but console gamers have been playing the waiting game with this one. Described as an adventure RPG set in "a wholesome post-apocalyptic world", the team at Pathea is aware of the performance-based shortcomings of the previous game on Switch — as discussed when we briefly went hands-on with a PC build of Sandrock at PAX East last year — so we've got our fingers crossed that this long-in-development sequel will be a solid performer out of the gate on Nintendo's console.

During our conversation, we veered onto the topic of EA Sports College Football, the revitalization of the long-running college-focused football franchise that ended with NCAA Football 14. In 2021, EA Sports announced the return of its college football franchise, but this time, leaving the NCAA name behind. In a somewhat humorous moment during the interview, when I mentioned "the return of the NCAA Football franchise," Mahar is quick to correct me that it's "College Football." 
We also dove into what it's like to develop an annualized title, along with the decisions that come with that. You can read those portions of the conversation below.

Madden NFL 23 effectively pushed the ball downfield for EA Sports' long-running franchise. Though the implementation of the foundational FieldSense system, which revamped how the gameplay feels on both sides of the ball, was solid, much like any rookie, it was clear it still needed to develop in order to reach its full potential.
Madden NFL 24 carries forward the gameplay improvements from last year while adding some exciting additions to modes like Franchise and the single-player-focused career mode. I traveled to Electronic Arts in Redwood Shores, California, to learn about what's new in this year's game and get my hands on the most recent build of the annualized football title.

Hello Games has announced the next free continuation of No Man’s Sky, and it’s called Singularity. It should be dropping for all platforms sometime today.
This is a pretty small one, I suppose. Compared to the Interceptor update, I mean. You can now play as a robot, which is pretty cool, and this is heavily featured in the trailer. I’d rather play as a fox. Like, a fox-person. Some sort of fox that travels the stars. A star fox, if you will.
The main feature of this update is that it continues the story started in the previous Interceptor update. Allegedly, this is part two of four in the narrative.
https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1666429824817065984?s=20
Furthermore, there’s the usual tweaks and cosmetic updates in Singularity. However, they're nothing that really makes me want to jump back into its universe.
For that matter, I picked up No Man’s Sky again after the Interceptor update and bounced off it yet again. I think the biggest reason for this is a bit of a personal one. Its universe just feels too artificial. These planets are just kind of floating there in a way that’s not natural. It’s hard to explain, but it just kind of ruins the fun of exploration for me.
I do appreciate that it’s getting constant support, even if, at this point, I have to concede that it’s just not for me.
That doesn’t mean it’s not for you, and you can find No Man’s Sky on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Dotemu and Tribute Games have today announced that last year's brilliant beat 'em up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is set to receive a whole new batch of totally tubular goodies in the upcoming 'Dimension Shellshock' DLC.
Releasing later this year, the game's first complete DLC package is set to be a big one. Chief among the additions is a brand new playable character, Usagi Yojimbo (traditionally called 'Miyamoto Usagi'), a sword-wielding rabbit that has fought alongside the turtles in both the comics and the animated series.

Launching later this year, this upcoming add-on takes the Turtles and their friends through time and space to take on new threats with the help of a familiar ally.
Ronin rabbit Usagi Yojimbo joins the game as a playable character. The samurai warrior has starred in his own self-titled comic series since the ‘80s, but many mainstream fans are likely familiar with him from his numerous crossover appearances in TMNT media over the decades. The trailer shows off Usagi’s formidable prowess with his katana, such as piercing through multiple foes with a single sword thrust. 


Dimension Shellshock also adds an unspecified new game mode, new tracks from composer Tee Lopes, and a fresh set of color schemes for the playable roster. Shredder’s Revenge is also getting another, separate free update that adds another batch of color palette options.
We’ll have to wait to learn more about Dimension Shellshock, but we’re excited to get our hands on it given the exceptional base game. You can read more about our thoughts on TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge by reading our review here.]]></summary>

I’ve been playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on and off for more than 40 hours since its launch. I know this is a pittance compared to some people, but for me, it’s a significant chunk of time. Around hour 35, however, a nagging thought was working its way into my mind and I couldn’t shake it. Now I’m at the point where I’m able to fully articulate what it was that I was feeling, though I suspect you probably won’t like it:

Largely because this was my first experience of it with gamepad controls, and using thumbsticks and face buttons to move and toss out spells just feels more... I don't know, direct? Like I’m actually controlling my Necromancer and her boney bodyguards, not just clicking a unit and watching their animations.
It helps that Diablo IV’s Steam Deck performance is surprisingly spry, with fast 45-60fps framerates within reach even when leaving the majority of graphics settings on Ultra quality. Unlike all of the other best Steam Deck games, there’s no native support for its Battle.net launcher, but with some resourcefulness, that needs only be a temporary barrier.

Sometimes, glitches sway in the player's favor, especially when it comes to item duplication insanity. Other times, especially when it comes to Game Freak titles, it can be a little less exciting. That was definitely the case for the recent Chesnaught glitch, which canceled a 7-star raid event for the first time.
In case you missed it, the "second chance" event was scheduled to run from May 19 through May 21 (in conjunction with the Great Tusk and Iron Treads event). However, hard crashes caused the powers that be to cancel the raid and remove it from the game entirely, promising a new release date so folks wouldn't miss out on Chesnaught. That time has now come.
The new date and time for the second chance Chesnaught Pokemon raid
The Pokemon Company has announced that the 7-star Chesnaught raid will return on June 16 9AM JST through June 19 at 8:59AM JST.
It's great that they patched things up, but the amount of glitches and performance issues in these two generational entries is frankly astounding. While it's nice to sit here and assume that Game Freak will get more time to fine-tune the next entry, the Pokemon machine cannot be stopped. There's two DLC expansions on the way, despite the fact that there's more work to be done to smooth the base games out.
One day something will change. But until that day comes, safely assuming that Switch-based Pokemon games will have technical issues is kind a tradition at this point.

Capcom has proudly announced that recent release Street Fighter 6 has hit the one million sales mark.
The scrapper sequel, which launched on PC and console platforms on June 2, had an enormously successful weekend, with over one million players passing through its Fighting Ground, Battle Hub, and World Tour modes. SF6 received positive reviews across the board for its great visuals, exciting new mechanics, and magnetic roster of new and familiar World Warriors. The response to three previous betas helped pave the way for the title's launch day success.
Capcom released a new image that sees series veteran Ryu fist-bumping with many recognizable roster stars, including Ken, Blanka, Chun-Li, Dhalsim, Elena, R. Mika, Cammy, and others.
https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1665795932917575682?s=20
With these new figures, the Street Fighter franchise now boasts a mighty 50 million lifetime sales, a deserved number for a series that, ultimately, wrote the blueprint for the fighting game genre. While the success of 1991's Street Fighter II can be considered the de facto release in the franchise's storied history, later games such as Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter III: Third Strike, and Ultra Street Fighter IV are similarly important in keeping the lifeblood of the series pumping from generation to generation.
Street Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Be sure to check out our guide hub for the title, as well as my thoughts on which characters should arrive via the DLC train.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some games adapt to VR more naturally than others. Games that take place primarily in a cockpit, like Elite Dangerous or Euro Truck Simulator 2, need relatively little adjustment to make them enjoyable in VR. They don't require the player to move around much, and their whole shtick about providing an authentic, immersive experience. 


Games that require a lot of fast movement, or require the player to keep track of a lot of different objects, are generally harder to make work through VR Goggles. Hence why Amid Evil VR caught my attention. Shooters are common VR fodder, but they're typically built as VR experiences from the ground up. Amid Evil, on the other hand, is a flatscreen retro shooter designed to be reactive, surreal, and above all, fast. It's a game where you zip around arcane dimensions like a magic missile, splattering weird little armoured guys with enchanted swords and a staff that fires planets. It's a brilliant game, one of the best old-skool shooters to emerge from the genre's revival. But on paper, it's about as VR friendly as Morpheus.

While Diablo IV has technically only been on the market a single day, (the majority of the player base having joined Early Access last week), Activision Blizzard's latest foray into the underworld is already chewing up the nights and days of its fanbase, amassing over 10,000 years of playtime in less than a week.
The developer says that over 93 million hours of Diablo IV have been played across its PC and console releases in just four days — A figure that frankly makes my head spin. While Blizzard is yet to reveal specific sales figures for the dungeon crawler, it has declared the sequel its fastest-selling release ever, beating out premium titles such as Starcraft II, Overwatch, and, of course, series predecessor Diablo III.

Thus (presumably) went the thought process of the developers behind Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine, a Super Meat Boy spinoff about lining up colourful meaty blobs while dodging buzzsaws and other grizzly hazards. Think Tetris meets match 4 meets Meat Boy slapstick. 
A demo came out in April, but publishers Thunderful Games have just announced you'll get to play the full thing on June 22nd.

For many streamers, Twitch is not just a place to broadcast content. It's a major source of income. Some creators build up huge communities that are dedicated to watching their channel, and this can lead to a successful career. However, the Amazon-owned streaming platform has once again become the subject of online controversy. Namely, there's been a change to its ad policy, which has not proven popular.
In a recent post on the site, Twitch announced it would be changing the type of "branded content" that broadcasters would be able to have on their channel. The changes indicate that streams will no longer be allowed to insert "burned-in" display, video, or audio ads. This basically refers to any advertisement that is a prerecorded sponsorship. …]]></summary>

Former Starcraft and Dota pro "cArn" has won the race to hit level 100 on a Diablo 4 Hardcore character, thus earning him a letter from the king and a nap. This is Diablo's permadeath mode, where one death is enough to wipe your progress. He dinged his final ding on his Barbarian in the early hours of June 5th, just five days after the game's early access launch, and he's now been officially confirmed as the first Hardcore centurion. It's a feat that sounds as impressive as it does exhausting.

As the genre has progressed through the generations, sports video games have become increasingly complicated as they add more wrinkles to their team management tools and more depth to their on-the-field action. Super Mega Baseball 4 harkens back to the sports games of the mid-90s, bringing streamlined gameplay and astounding levels of customization while introducing novel concepts. But though the throwback approach is sound in many ways, it does come with some concessions.

It sounds like things are shifting at Electronic Arts and BioWare. A new report from IGN says EA is nearing an agreement to hand development and operation of Star Wars: The Old Republic to a third-party studio.
According to IGN's report, Broadsword Online Games—developer of Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot—would take the reins. The deal is expected to be final as soon as this month.
Over half of the 70 to 80 people on the core Old Republic team are expected to move to Broadsword. Those remaining with EA will reportedly have an opportunity to look for other roles in the company, but could otherwise see layoffs.

Now it's 2023 and Lisa: The Painful is getting a Definitive Edition re-release, and I'm lucky that I can draw on better known references. It's like Undertale by way of... Uh, thecatamites?

From its humble 1987 Final Fantasy I beginnings to this year’s upcoming tentpole release, Final Fantasy XVI, the series has, in some way, shape, or form, remained prominent for decades. Part of its success likely comes from how easy it is to get into any new mainline game, which is to say every new entry stands alone (save for the few direct sequels). Final Fantasy II isn’t a direct sequel to Final Fantasy I, just like Final Fantasy VII isn’t one to Final Fantasy VI.

Activision Blizzard's latest jaunt into the underworld might have only just launched in an official capacity, but the development team is already at work on campaign expansions and other extended content — To be released on PC and console platforms over the coming years.
The two expansions were referenced by Diablo IV general manager Rod Fergusson in an interview with Kinda Funny Games that took place late last week. According to Fergusson, the team is currently concentrating on both its seasonal output for the remainder of the year, as well as two full expansions, which one would assume are similar in scope to Diablo III's 2014 expansion, Reaper of Souls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ6M39OmYMA
"As I sit here we're about to launch the main game, we're finishing up season one, we're working on season two, we're working on expansion one, we're kicking off expansion two," explained Fergusson. "All that's happening right now and we haven't even launched the game yet [...] We're going to be supporting Diablo IV for years to come [with] very rich seasons, much richer than we had in Diablo III."
Diablo IV launched in an Early Access capacity for Ultimate Edition owners last week, but officially hits the market today for all other players. While this new tale of demons and the people who love them has seen its fair share of launch issues, the new sequel has been positively received by many critics and fans, who have been quick to sink into Diablo's typical evening-eating action, exploring Sanctuary in pursuit of the Queen of the Succubi, Lillith.
Diablo IV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Lisa: The Painful originally came out in 2014. It took the general aesthetics of the Mother (Earthbound) series and twisted them into a traumatizing mix of whimsy and tragedy. You play as a man who travels a post-apocalyptic wasteland in search of his adopted daughter; one of the last remaining women on Earth.
I have a friend who counts Lisa: The Painful as one of their favorite games of all time. I can’t do it, though. Back in the day, I bought it, played a bit of the intro, and then realized that continuing would absolu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last resort
Nintendo has revealed that the star of Pikmin 4 will be you! Or whatever uni-browed monstrosity you can put together in the character creator.
Previous games in the Pikmin series have had you play as one or more pre-defined explorers. It started with Olimar, before reaching its peak with Pikmin 3’s Brittany (and some other people). However, I often say that a character creator always makes a game better. I am jazzed so hard to see one make its way into Pikmin 4.
https://youtu.be/6ixnXjtQ7f8
The trailer Nintendo released with the announcement also shows off a bit of the story. It seems Captain Olimar has once again crashed on planet PNF-404. A rescue expedition flies off to retrieve them, and they also crash. So, they send the newest recruit to the rescue corps to rescue the rescuers, and that’s you!
I find that hilarious because the trailer makes it appear like you don’t have much of a ship with you. It very much makes it appear that your character is the bottom of the barrel. You’re not some hotshot. You’re just the only one who hasn’t crashed (yet).
Pikmin 4 is my most anticipated game of the year, mostly because we’ve been teased about it so much. Nintendo announced the game back when the Wii U was still a thing. However, I'm excited about the direction that we've seen so far. I’m a little concerned that the dungeon caves of Pikmin 2 might return, but we’ll see. I’m as optimistic as my brain allows me.
Pikmin 4 launches on Nintendo Switch on July 21, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A demo is out now
It seems almost impossible at this stage for there to ever be a third Half-Life game. It's just been so long, and chances are that a threequel would struggle to live up to the hype. However, there are still new ways to get your Gordon Freeman kicks. For example, modder PinkyDev is working on a modification that turns Valve's iconic FPS into a roguelike shooter.
Called Codename: Loop, the demo for the project has just been released, so you can try it out before it releases fully. There's also a video over on ModDB that shows the Half-Life fan project in action. With a new top-down, isometric look, you once again control the mute scientist as he battles his way through invading Xen aliens. While PinkyDev says the plot is not yet written, the general story will involve G-Man confining Freeman to "an ever-changing loop" to test his skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ8cZGctdaU
When it will actually release cannot be said at this stage. Also, the reason why it doesn't have Half-Life in the title is because, as the modder says, it stops it from getting confused with other fan-made or official games on Steam. Oh, that's the other thing. This mod will be coming to Steam. According to a report from PCGamesN, Codename: Loop was given the blessing of Valve, which says a lot about the developer's dedication toward the modding community.
While the first game, originally released in 1998, had a huge impact on the FPS genre, 2004's Half-Life 2 pretty much surpassed it. The sequel is easily one of the best games Valve has ever made, but that doesn't detract from the OG's influence. Loop joins the likes of the unofficial remake Black Mesa in a small yet respectable list of fan games that continue the HL legacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following on from the lovely space highjinks of Citizen Sleeper, Katharine has unwisely allowed me to take the wheel on this month's RPS Game Club, and thus I am steering this baby right into fiendish puzzle town. Next stop: The Tartarus Key! 
It's only recently come out, so we're fresh to death this time - literally, because in it you're trapped in a mansion full of SAW-esque murder-puzzles. I really enjoyed this game, with its low-poly PS1 style, and its vibe of being an early 00s thriller that would probably star e.g. Morgan Freeman hunting down a twisted serial killer played by e.g. Hugh Jackman. But in this metaphor, I am the twisted monster, and I have trapped both you and my colleagues and am forcing you all to play this game I like.

The series' visuals fall somewhere between realism and fantasy, and it’s always fun to see how Square Enix studios leverage more powerful hardware to bring worlds to life. These settings, characters, and monsters are memorable, and a large reason for that is the art. It’s striking and unique – you know it’s Final Fantasy when you see it. 
With each new Final Fantasy, Square Enix has a chance to solidify characters and worlds into the zeitgeist of gaming, like the company has done in the past with Final Fantasy VII’s Cloud Strife, Final Fantasy X’s Zanarkand, and more. During my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices, I spoke to Final Fantasy XVI art director Hiroshi Minagawa about how developer Creative Business Uni…]]></summary>

This news comes by way of a new Pikmin 4 trailer released today, which sets up the story of the game and shows off what its customization options look like. As for the story, you play as a rescue explorer sent to a mysterious planet to rescue not one crew but two, each from a separate crashed ship. Before landing, though, you'll need to customize your explorer, and today's trailer indicates you can change their head shape, body shape, face, hair, clothes, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the new Pikmin 4 trailer: 


Pikmin 4 hits Switch on July 21, 2023.

The Diablo vibes are strong, it has some neat ideas for the genre, and it has a demo you can try for free. I only wish it drew a little more inspiration from Diablo and a little less from Survivors 'em up conventions.

Diablo IV successfully tempts me to gleefully indulge in sin at every turn. A thrilling hunt for rare loot feeds my insatiable greed and lust for power. The satisfaction of slaughtering thousands of foes, supernatural or otherwise, leaves little room for remorse. Whether taking down the forces of darkness alone or with friends, this is a massive and deeply engrossing action RPG that keeps me coming back for more dozens upon dozens of hours later.

If you've been hanging on with eager anticipation for the release date of CGI spin-off Resident Evil: Death Island, then hang no more, as Capcom, and Sony Pictures have revealed that the cool/dopey-looking feature will arrive on physical and digital media on July 25.
The latest in a long-running series of animated movies set within Capcom's survival horror universe, Death Island will see the A-list team of Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, (oh, and Rebecca Chambers is there too), team up together for the very first time to handle a mutant outbreak on Alcatraz Island. Fans are particularly excited as this is the first time in Resi canon that Kennedy and Valentine have ever crossed paths.

It looks like harmless, monster-mashing fun, with action that you'd expect places its tongue firmly in its cheek, but is probably intended as utterly earnest. This probably will not be the only Resident Evil news we receive this month, as Capcom has recently announced a Capcom Showcase stream to take place this Monday, June 12. We can likely expect updates on updates for titles such as Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Village, including the long-awaited "Separate Ways" DLC for the former.
Resident Evil: Death Island launches on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download July 25.

Although, I suppose it actually is, because Rebirth is set in 1937, and Amnesia: The Bunker is effectively a bottle episode taking place during the First World War. And what a bottle episode! You'll spend 4-6 hours being chased around the tunnels of a maze-like bunker, winding up a dim, rubbish torch and reading increasingly unhinged diary notes from the French soldiers who've all been eaten, and boy will you have a great time.

Studios Motion Twin and Evil Empire have announced that popular fantasy Metroidvania Dead Cells has now smashed past 10 million global sales. This incredible number represents an accumulation of sales on PC and console since the games' Early Access debut back in the summer of 2017.
"Following the success of Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Evil Empire has been exploring the path forward for the title as a whole," said the studio in a celebratory statement. "With years of successful updates and expansions behind it after taking over live ops of Dead Cells in 2019, the studio is tinkering with its time-tested methodology, experimenting with ideas for future updates and new ways for fans to enjoy one of their favorite roguelikes."

The studio also revealed that plans are in motion to develop new updates and DLC for Dead Cells for the foreseeable future — with new content drops planned until at least 2025. Just recently, Dead Cells fans were able to enjoy the aforementioned Return to Castlevania DLC, which saw Dead Cells partner with one of the foremost titles in the Metroidvania genre, bringing familiar locales, enemies, and bosses to the title.
Outside of the digital realm, Dead Cells is also being adapted for the tabletop crowd, with an official board game in the works at Scorpion Masque. This project opened its crowdfunding campaign with a $30,000 USD target, and successfully raised around half a million dollars in less than fifteen minutes. Clearly, even with an amazing 10 million sales under its tunic, Dead Cells is only just beginning to open up its fascinatingly weird universe
Dead Cells is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and iOS and Android platforms.

Capcom also notes in its announcement that this showcase serves as a special digital event to celebrate its 40th anniversary.
The publisher-developer has had a great 2023 so far between releases like Resident Evil 4 Remake and the recently released Street Fighter 6, both of which faired extremely well with both critics and fans.

Yes, yes, we know that's the same day as Geoff's Annual Trainer Showcase (aka: Summer Game Fest), but hey, at least it's for a good cause, with all proceeds going to the lovely folks at GamesAid. Tickets are on sale now, and RPS supporters can also get a special code to nab themselves a free drink. Details below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout the Spider-Verse
The latest Spidey film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse opened over the weekend. Amid the action, some have noticed gameplay footage of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 casually playing during one scene.
When this was pointed out, fans posted on Resetera about it. In response, as spotted by Eurogamer, Insomniac community director James Stevenson confirmed "it is new."
It's a relatively small, tucked-away cameo that appears on a television early in the movie. I saw Spider-Verse over the weekend and noticed some gameplay, but figured it was just a plug of some already seen footage. It's hard to actually discern anything major out of it, aside from seeing some mechanical arms on Peter's suit.
So while it's a neat little easter egg, I don't think you need to buy a movie ticket just to see some new gameplay.

Doing whatever a spider can
It's not like we need new gameplay right away, anyways. We got a pretty big spotlight on the new Spider-Man game from Insomniac at the recent PlayStation Showcase. We saw both Peter and Miles, and how the game will swap between the two at key moments for its story.
Kraven, Lizard, and more also pop up during the spotlight too. It's certainly not as laden with Spider-People as Across the Spider-Verse is, but it's looking like Insomniac has a lot of Spidey action planned for this fall.
Meanwhile, while you shouldn't pick up a ticket for the gameplay cameo, you should definitely still go see Across the Spider-Verse. It was an absolutely phenomenal achievement in animation and a great follow-up to one of my personal favorite super-hero films. It's worth your time, with or without the Spider-Man 2 gameplay tease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the arrival of Nvidia RTX 40-series graphics cards in gaming laptops, models with previous-gen RTX 30-series cards are becoming super-affordable. Now you can get even high-models for less than £1000, including this HP Omen machine which includes a 16.1-inch 1440p 165Hz display, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and Ryzen 7 6800H CPU for £972 on Amazon. 
The same machine retailed for £1629 in March this year, so this is a huge bargain - especially given that this is still hugely a powerful machine for 1440p gaming. The spec even includes a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, so it's a convincing machine from top to bottom.

Complete Priority Quests Immediately
Diablo IV has three types of color-coded quests: Story (yellow), Side (blue), and Priority (white). Priority quests are, as the name implies, important because they introduce new game mechanics, such as a new type of store opening up or unlocking a mount. Don’t let these gather dust in your quest log. Otherwise, you’ll be missing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s a single upside to the collapsing standards of technical competence among big-budget PC games, it’s that when something like Diablo 4 comes along and simply performs well, there’s an almost pleasant relief to it. Like your bus arriving on time, a minute after watching the previous, late-arriving one flip onto its roof attempting a handbrake turn.  
It’s not perfect, but Diablo IV does run smoothly for the most part (also sorry Google, but I'm going back to Roman numberals), and its system requirements on PC are as likely to involve museum pieces as they are the latest and priciest graphics cards. I’ve put some hours into the early access build and have come up with a best settings guide, but in truth, this will likely just optimise your framerates – Diablo IV’s higher quality settings rarely trouble it, especially at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You don't need to play 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy its sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, according to the game's co-director Motuma Toriyama. 
Last week, Square Enix and the official Final Fantasy VII Twitter account began releasing new details about the upcoming sequel, answering one question each day. On day one, we learned Rebirth is "progressing smoothly." Day 2 and Day 3 were less exciting, teasing that players will have a "high degree of freedom, experiencing a myriad of different stories" and that players "will witness a chain of narrative events that lie at the very heart of the Final Fantasy VII story." 
For Day 4, the question is: Do I need to play Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? And here's Toriyama's answer: "No – we have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth." 
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth

June 5, 2023
If I had to guess, Rebirth will feature an introductory cutscene or minimovie that summarizes the events of the first game but only time will tell.
Rebirth is slated to release this winter, although an official release date has not yet been revealed. Considering it's Final Fantasy "7," many are speculating that Square Enix's daily QA will end on Day 7, which would be this Thursday, June 8. That's also the same day Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest presentation will air so perhaps we'll be seeing some footage of Rebirth during that, or at least maybe learning when we can play this game.
For more, check out Game Informer's June Summer Game Fest 2023 schedule, and then read our Final Fantasy VII Remake review to find out why you probably should play it before Rebirth. Check out our thoughts on Final Fantasy VII Remake's Episode Intermission DLC after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those in the UK, the latest “here’s what you could have won” bit of helpful EU regulation just dropped. Valve are now required to show Steam users in EU countries a game’s lowest price over the past 30 days, which means sellers can’t display deceptively high discounts by bumping the base price before a sale. Valve made the change in order to comply with the ominously named “Omnibus Directive”, which applies to all online stores.
Steam already enforces limits on manipulating prices around sales, but it’s nice that some people get to have a little extra peace of mind.

        <updated>2023-06-05T12:18:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft announced last month that it would be holding an Xbox Games Showcase this month, immediately followed by a Starfield Direct focused exclusively on Bethesda Game Studios' upcoming sci-fi RPG. According to the vice president of Xbox games marketing at Microsoft Aaron Greenberg, during the showcase, none of the company's first-party games will be "full CG trailers," as reported by GamesRadar. 
He goes on to explain this means every first-party trailer will be "either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematic" and each trailer will be labeled appropriately so it's clear what we're looking at. Greenberg tweeted this in response to someone poking fun at showcase tendencies to rely heavily on CGI trailers. 
None of our first party games in the show are full CG trailers. Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.
June 4, 2023
This all started with Greenberg quote-tweeting an Xbox tweet that highlights that the Xbox Games Showcase is live in seven days (well, six days now) on June 11. He quote-tweeted this Xbox tweet to reveal that the showcase is "roughly two hours of non stop games, games, games, games, and Starfield."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early 2020 the Bulgarian Association of Music Producers (BAMP) and IFPI launched legal action to compel local ISPs to block The Pirate Bay and Zamunda, Bulgaria's most-visited pirate site. This week a Bulgarian court ordered local ISPs to block both sites, including all mirrors and proxies. The music groups say they're pleased with the outcome but the details suggest that local ISPs were against the process right from the beginning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are 152 Shrines in Tears of the Kingdom which means finding and solving them all is no small feat. Compartively, Breath of the Wild had 120 (and you can see what finding all of those earned you here), but the reward is surprising, bizarre, and raises some interesting questions about the larger Zelda lore. It's worth noting that there are spoilers below for a late-game unlock.
After skipping the two cutscenes that play at the end of every Shrine for the last approximately 165 hours, the final Shrine shows some unique text and suggests the player visit the Temple of Time for a reward.

The Temple of Time is located on the island where you began your Tears of the Kingdom journey and the King Raura and Queen Sonia statues are definitely not referring the Temple of Time ruins on the plate…]]></summary>

That growth has enabled the sort of projects that might have been unheard of only a decade ago, with price points and complexity of play that can seem astounding to newcomers. Nonetheless, the dedicated audience for board games continues to clamor for ever higher-end projects with deep systems that enable truly epic adventures. That unique landscape paves the way for remarkable games like Aeon Trespass: Odyssey.

Not because it is unpleasant or incessant but rather because I so desperately want to hear it as I hunt for the last few Shrines in the game. But now, when I do hear it, the Shrine it is pointing to is so obscure that I spend hours trying to find the source of the noise.
I am far beyond the friendly sight of the bright green spiral reaching into the sky that I can see from miles away. I have found every one of those. Looking out into the distance, I see the occasional green door signaling a Shrine I have already discovered. Every single time, without fail, it makes me think I have finally found a new Shrine before coming to the same realization I have come to …]]></summary>

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, its soundtrack is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists. 
That’s why I was so excited to chat with composer Masayoshi Soken about his score for Final Fantasy XVI. You might recognize his name as he’s also the composer of Final Fantasy XIV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second chapter of the planned Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy of games, received a brief but welcomed progress report from producer Yoshinori Kitase. Though we haven’t heard a peep about the game since its reveal last June, we could be getting a release date soon. 
In a tweet, Kitase answered the question of how Rebirth is progressing by simply stating, “Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan. We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game.”

While not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. 
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully, we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. 
For more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI on June 22, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm unsure whether to call Raid On Taihoku a "historical game", since it's an adventure game with enough daftness to feel a bit unlike what that phrase brings to mind. But it's set very thoroughly in Taiwan towards the end of World War II, and though the focus is a young girl's relationship with her family and friends, that context is critical to why I've enjoyed it so much.
Taxonomy aside, then, the important thing is that it's enjoyable. It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.

Rather than spending money on the game, the team asks that you might consider donating that money to “trans creators, trans-inclusive charities local to you, and trans people in need,” in honour of Pride Month. Regardless, the supernatural mystery is one of the best recent adventure games and is well worth the time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Brevik, now the president of Skystone Games, did not expect to encounter a doppelganger when he arrived at Chicago’s Consumer Electronic Show in the summer of 1994. He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.


Without their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series.

More specifically, Nintendo is releasing the Pastel Pink Joy-Con, Pastel Yellow Joy-Con, Pastel Purple Joy-Con, and Pastel Green Joy-Con on June 30, which is the same day Nintendo's newly announced sequel to 2017's 1-2-Switch hits the console.  The Joy-Con will be sold in standard pairs. The Pastel Pink and Pastel Yellow Joy-Con are packaged together and the Pastel Purple and Pastle Green Joy-Con are packaged together. 
Each set of Joy-Con will include two black Joy-Con wrist straps as well. The Joy-Con are currently showing as sold out on Nintendo's online store. If they were available, you could pre-purchase them now so that you receive them quickly when they start shipping on June 30. Nonetheless, the store makes it clear these Pastel Joy-Con will cost $79.99 for a set, which is in line with other previously released sets of Joy-Con.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed a sequel to 2017's Switch launch title 1-2-Switch, and it's out this month. 
Titled Everybody 1-2-Switch!, this sequel features team-based games that can be played using Switch console Joy-Con and mobile devices. Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams "and see which group can win a certain number of games first," while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. 
Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. 
While this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. 
It's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of 1-2-Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the airing of The Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, you could argue that we are officially in the season formerly known as E3. This morning, ahead of its stream, Meta shared details about its upcoming Meta Quest 3 headset, which included a few teases for games that would be revealed during its stream, which you can find the details for below.
The showcase ended with the reveal of Asgard's Wrath 2. The original Asgard's Wrath is one of VR's biggest, most ambitious (and well-reviewed) games. The sequel picks up where the story of the first game left off while adding all kinds of new mechanics. You can find more on Asgard's Wrath 2 in the upcoming issue of Game Informer's magazine, where we spoke with the game's director. The other exciting element of the sequel is it will be coming to Quest 2…]]></summary>

Its list price is a faintly ridiculous $219, but right now you can pick up a brand new set of these headphones for $54.99 at Woot. That's a solid $15 off the same set on Amazon, and a great price for headphones of this level of quality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When RPS awarded Kentucky Route Zero the title of Game Of The Year in 2013, only two episodes out of an eventual five had been released. If this sounds like a bland statement of fact, just think about it for a second. I can't recall any other time an episodic adventure game has received GOTY-level praise before it was even concluded, let alone only 40% done.
Episodes three through five arrived sporadically: in spring 2014, summer 2016, and — after what must have been an agonising hiatus — the start of 2020. Having bypassed this wait to play the game for the first time only recently, I feel wistfully as though I'll never share quite the same fond feelings for it as contemporary fans (like our own reviews ranger Rachel, who recently named KRZ one of her all-time favourite indie games). But I'm also quite relieved that I didn't have to exercise that kind of patience. I mean, I'm very good at neglecting to carry on with games for years at a time despite thoroughly enjoying what I've played so far. But I like doing it on my terms, you know?
I initially attempted to do something a bit clever with this retrospective. I wanted to play the first two episodes that earned KRZ our GOTY nod in 2013, and write up on them as a discrete entity as far as possible. Only then did I plan to carry on the game and add some follow-up impressions, perhaps assessing whether I thought RPS would still award the big chocolate medal to the full game as it finally came to be in 2020. But, after sitting with my feelings about Episodes 1-2 for a couple of weeks, any intelligent observations I might have made were drowned out by an increasingly loud, insistent voice in the back of my head howling: "I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS." Actually, that might be a good impression to just let stand on its own merits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow we’re already in June, which makes me both cosmically confused about the passage of time and quite happy because it’s now Pride Month. That also means that queer indie developers have once again banded together and organised the third annual Queer Games Bundle on Itch.io, offering over 450 video games, board games, zines, books, soundtracks, and other creative stuff for the price of one AAA game: $60. All proceeds are split between the participating developers, and there’s some very cool stuff included. 


“Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way,” reads the bundle's description, “and in exchange, you get over 450 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks.”

During my cover story trip to Tokyo, Japan, to speak to developer Creative Business Unit III, I learned a lot about magic in FFXVI and how it affects Clive’s life and everyone in this world. The special tattoo on Clive’s face is the mark of a Bearer, which indicates he can use magic. This might seem like a great ability, but the nations of Valisthea view Bearers as something other than human. These nations brand their Bearers to show they are enslaved, and nations trade Bearers across borders based on who needs their magical abilities. When Clive receives this branding, h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some employees at Bethesda's Arkane Studios reportedly hoped that Microsoft, after acquiring Bethesda in 2020, might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single-player game, according to a new report from Bloomberg. 
That didn't happen, however, and Redfall launched on May 2 to poor reception from critics and players. Game Informer gave it a 5 out of 10 in our review. Xbox head Phil Spencer said on Kinda Funny Games' Xcast that he was disappointed with the Redfall launch. "I'm upset with myself," he told the Xcast.
Despite hopes for a new approach to the game following that 2020 acquisition, Microsoft remained hands-off and allowed development on the title to continue as normal, save for canceling a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall.

This Steam Deck vs Asus ROG Ally comparison is new and improved with actual testing results, both hard data (I may even borrow some benchmark graphs from the ROG Ally review) and those of the observational/anecdotal/downright take-y variety.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka could serve two and a half years in prison as part of his sentencing for insider trading charges. 
Abema Times reports that prosecutors on the case asked that Naka go to prison for two years and six months in a Tokyo District Court today, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Prosecutors also demanded that Naka pay a fine of 2.5 million yen (roughly $17,900) as well as a supplementary penalty of 170 million yen (roughly $1.2 million). Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced, but a final decision on the matter isn't expected until July 7, VGC reports. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind the new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Then, less than a month later, Naka was re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka reportedly purchased 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Now, Naka has been charged and could face more than two and a half years in prison alongside more than $1 million in fines. A final decision on his charges is expected next month.

In the Netherlands, ISP KPN went up against BREIN recently, citing concerns over its application for a shape-shifting dynamic injunction. KPN couldn't prevent Lookmovie and Flixtor from being blocked but the discussion was one worth having.

But without fail, I’ll dunk half a jar of those salty little bad boys into my bubbling wok without hesitation. Peppers? Why not. Carrot? Absolutely. Spinach? Don’t mind if I do. My bolognese is about as authentically Italian as Super Mario, but it doesn’t matter. I’m not trying to make Massimo Bottura cry by reminding him of his nonna’s cooking. It’s a dreary Tuesday night and I’m craving my olive-laden concoction. I’m making this bolognese just for me.


Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer reminded me a lot of my bolognese. It’s a game created for particular tastes, a unique proposition that sort of defies conventional thinking. A big, bold swing that -  if you have the palate for it - is absolutely brilliant.

The presumption might be that developer Creative Business Unit III wanted this game to have more violence to accompany its new action-heavy combat, but that’s not the case. The team put little thought into the rating – it just came naturally, according to various members of CBUIII I spoke to for our FFXVI cover story. 
“We actually get this question kind of a lot – people ask us if the rating went up because [we] wanted to make a more violent game, and the answer to that is no,” producer Naoki Yoshida says. “On the outside, it doesn’t appear [the rating system] has changed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you woke up in a mysterious mansion, with no memory of how you got there and only a walkie-talkie and a bunch of security cameras for company, how d'you reckon you'd handle it? Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.
In this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.
It's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.

Yeah, sure the Aardman films are whimsical and fun, but have you seen those early Wallace and Gromit shorts? There’s something kind of unsettling about the odd shape of Wallace’s uneven head and I've always deeply hated that you can sometimes see the subtle lines of a thumb imprint on parts of his face, like he’s been smothered inbetween the pads of two giant fingers. It’s so uncomfortable - and don’t even get me started on that monster Morph.
Ever since I first spotted the creepy Twitter gifs of claymation game Elation For The Wonder Box 6000, I’ve felt that same discomfort in the pit of my stomach. It’s not out yet, or even has a confirmed release date, but I just need people to witness this game. Like, just clicking through the screenshots make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. It’s awful, and wonderful. You can watch the trailer below. The bit where the lumps of clay wriggle inside the gun's bullet chambers goes through me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute favourite elements of Citizen Sleeper is how you essentially play as a nobody. When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.
But it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.

It’s an interesting aspect of this story because it speaks to how broad its horizons might be.

It also means we’ll be seeing a lot of Clive’s life. During my cover story trip, I played a few of FFXVI’s opening hours, much of which took place in the past, when Clive is just 15 and his younger brother Joshua even younger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.
Players race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. 


Modes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. 
The popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.]]></summary>

It’s a question you could imagine being posed to Ken Levine, or Warren Spector, or several other notable designers who could reasonably lay claim to the legacy of Looking Glass and Irrational’s legendary immersive sims. Instead, it was asked of Stephen Kick - at the time, a recently unemployed videogame artist holidaying in a Guatemalan hostel. Up until that point, Kick had dedicated his life to creative pursuits. He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name. Hardly the foundation for a follow-up to two of the most acclaimed PC games of all time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You didn’t hear it from me, but games look different now to how they did in 1994. Mmm. Nonetheless, Nightdive Studio’s System Shock remake stays resolutely faithful to the Looking Glass original even when giving it a modern 3D makeover, with a retro flourish in its intentionally pixellated textures.
As a snappy little After Eight to the main course of Jeremy Peel’s review and OG System Shock oral history (both great, do go read those first), here’s a look at how the 2023 remake’s visuals compare to the trailblazing immsim’s previous iterations. In other words, the 2015 System Shock: Enhanced Edition, also by Nightdive, and the original. Well, System Shock Classic, which is basically the original except it runs on my PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox’s official social media channels seem to be teasing something to do with Fable. The main Xbox channel posted a clip to Twitter that moves through a house, following a glittery trail from a controller to a monitor displaying the Xbox Games Showcase art. The Fable games used sparkly breadcrumb trails as a waypoint of sorts and the clip also had some jolly fairytale music on top, leading many to guess that the long-dormant series would finally rear its head again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021's Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City blended together the stories of the first Resident Evil game and its sequel, Resident Evil 2 (which received a fantastic remake in 2019), and while it wasn't a complete knockout hit, some have been asking for a sequel. It seems one might be on the way. 
According to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called "Umbrella Chronicles," and it's receiving $2 million. 
If you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know "Umbrella Chronicles" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind "Umbrella Chronicles" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. 
It's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details.

Inspired by the older Final Fantasies and Dragon Questies, you’ll be engaging in turn-based brawls and running around in magical pixel realms. But unlike those games, you’ll climb the wrestling ladder from fresh-faced rookie to world champ - instead of the usual RPG trope where you go from a village’s rat-killer to the universe’s god-killer.

Naturally, the voices Hannan uses between Joshua and Hugo are different but there’s a young familiarity to it and it turns out, it was actually his performance as the latter that landed him the role of the former, according to FFXVI localization director Michael-Christopher Koji Fox. 
Koji says the auditions for Joshua’s voice were some of the first to happen. The team chose an actor that was very close to puberty, he says, but at the time, it seemed like it’d work out just fine. In some instances within ga…]]></summary>

I don't think it's ruining any surprise to tell you that it's one of those games with horrible, horrible mannequins which can move when you're not looking. I hate this type of monster! It's a very good type of monster! And I hate it! And this little game is a decent one of these. So that's a short bit of fun for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Diablo 4 gave me a real case of the "Have I changed, or have the games changed?", and I think the answer is "yes". For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo 3, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.
To wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.

I’ve spent dozens of hours roaming Sanctuary over the last two weeks, having completed the campaign, hit level 50, unlocked the Paragon Board, graduated to World Tier III, and devoured as much post-game content as I could in the allotted review period, such as the Whispers of the Dead missions and Helltides. 
However, I’m not ready to assign a score until I’ve gotten to play the game under normal conditions: with the servers live and teeming with players hunting Lilith. That means you won’t see a full review until I've spent a good deal of time with the launch version of the adventure. Until then, I’ll give my impressions on the things I can talk about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the next first-party PlayStation title making the jump to Steam on July 26, marking the series' first appearance on PC. 
The 2021 dimension-hopping adventure served as one of the earliest showcases of the PlayStation 5’s tech (namely it’s fast-loading SSD), and the PC version sports additional bells and whistles such as: 
Performance-enhancing upscaling for Nvidia DLSS 3, AMD FSR 2, and Intel XeSS
Unlocked framerate
Ray-traced reflections/shadows
Ultra-wide support for 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9 monitors


Developer Nixxes Software is handling this PC port of the acclaimed action platformer, which sees Ratchet & Clank fighting to stop their old foe Dr. Nefarious from conquering the multiverse with the help of Ratchet's alternate universe counterpart, Rivet. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing, "It’s a great continuation of the series that is just a joy to play. It steals your eye with its stunning vistas, makes you care about the characters, and is loaded to the hilt with fan service (especially in the alternate dimension and a weapon you have to assemble)."

On one hand, you likely want to appeal to the fans of the series, and on the other, you want to attract new players. But it’s impossible to please everyone when making big changes like developer Creative Business Unit III is doing with Final Fantasy XVI – using a real-time action combat system that couldn’t be further from the series’ classic turn-based roots. 
As someone who loves the franchise’s turn-based format and its more action-forward design as of late, and as someone who’s played FFXVI for more than five hours at this point, I’m quite pleased with the combat. It’s fast-paced, action-heavy, and perhaps most importantly, fitting of this world and these characters. I especially like the singular focus on Clive,…]]></summary>

That could be worth upgrading to, if the T700 itself stayed within reach of most PC owners.
Reader, the price is not right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The October 2022 announcement of Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive streaming series from Genvid Entertainment and Konami, raised some eyebrows from fans but provided little in the way of details. Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.
In this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.
Silent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. 
Silent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year. If this unique concept has piqued your interest, you can check out the reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.
Countless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”
Here’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.

It’s no secret that Street Fighter V got off to a disastrous start, and despite years of course correction, its flawed foundation made a comeback difficult. By contrast, Street Fighter 6 is a thorough response to its predecessor’s failings, defined by well-considered central mechanics, formidable single-player offerings, and a plethora of smart decisions that make for a powerful opening punch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.
There have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.

That's a lot to pay for a single fan, but these fans normally cost double - think upwards of £22 for a single fan! - so this is actually a heck of a bargain.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2023/05/29/final-fantasy-16s-combat-director-is-excited-to-see-what-unexpected"/>
        <updated>2023-05-29T19:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. 
I also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? 
“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. 
“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”
Like Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 27, the development team behind Wii and GameCube emulator Dolphin announced a massive roadblock: Nintendo's legal team was moving to prevent the software from launching on Steam. While the Dolphin team is investigating its options, the project is currently "indefinitely postponed." Here's the full quote from their blog post:
It is with much disappointment that we have to announce that the Dolphin on Steam release has been indefinitely postponed. We were notified by Valve that Nintendo has issued a cease and desist citing the DMCA against Dolphin's Steam page, and have removed Dolphin from Steam until the matter is settled. We are currently investigating our options and will have a more in-depth response in the near future.
We appreciate your patience in the meantime.

And it occurs to me that the vast, vast, vast majority of you will never have met me in real life. The evidence that I exist in physical space is comparatively minimal! How do you know I'm not an AI? An AI could probably replicate my writing style quite thoroughly, because there are at present many thousands of my - mine, my own - words on the internet, and they and everything else have and are being scraped by AI. This thought process is as a result of a few AI things intersecting with my workspace at once recently. Several of them are quite funny, and also not. If you think AI tools are actually good for writers then I have to assume you don't really think much about either.

Not an assault rifle or mini-pistol, but a decades-old email chain between her TriOptimum bosses and a psychologist named Jeffrey Hammer. In the early stages of Citadel’s construction, Hammer suggested that each level of the station be designed in such a way as to induce stress and anxiety, so that experts could study their impact on the human psyche during space travel.
“I always knew something was off about this place!”, wrote Stacy to a colleague. “We are just rats in a maze.”

For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now!
