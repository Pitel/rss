        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One long night
2011’s Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective feels like it’s always been a bit of an oddball. The DS title was Ace Attorney director Shu Takumi’s shot to create something new, a “different kind of mystery” from the courtroom battles of Phoenix Wright and friends.
Though received well, sales seem mixed; it was a best-selling Nintendo DS game in Japan the week of its release, but Capcom would later note it struggled. All of this helped build, at least in my perception, a cult-classic vibe around it. It wasn’t the most popular DS game, but those in the know who dug the DS highly valued it.
So that's where we find Ghost Trick now, as it's getting a revival on modern consoles. A demo is currently available, containing the first two chapters. And alongside a chance to play that section a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patch 1.1.0 brings several fixes as well
If you've been waiting to play the remake of The Last of Us Part I on Steam Deck, you're in luck. The latest update for the game now makes Naughty Dog's masterpiece compatible with the Valve handheld.
Update 1.1.0 for the game also comes with a ton of tweaks and changes. Looking at the patch notes on Steam shows a healthy list of fixes. Chief among these are important optimizations for CPU and GPU performances, improvements to texture loading, as well as a number of glitch repairs and bug fixes.
When The Last of Us Part 1 was released on PC back in March, the game was plagued with more than its fair share of issues. This led to a series of negative reviews on Steam, as players were understandably upset about the state of the anticipated remake. Several updates have been released since launch, fixing around 40 bugs and glitches, so it's in much better shape these days, at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxVyuE2Nn_w
Easily considered one of the best releases of the PS3 era, the original The Last of Us was a tour de force in video game development and storytelling. A slick remaster was released for PS4 in 2014, while the smash-selling sequel launched in 2020. The Last of Us Part II did split the crowd somewhat, but it was still an impactful game from Naughty Dog.
Despite the series' reputation, some were skeptical that the studio was remaking something that was barely a decade old and already looked stunning even on previous-gen hardware. That said, the remake enjoyed a positive reception, and the HBO adaptation was highly praised indeed. In short, The Last of Us, as a brand, is doing very well for itself, and now you can even play Part I on the go!
The Last of Us Part I is available now on PS5 and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the first 30 minutes are anything to go by.
After spending half an hour with Oxenfree II: Lost Signals at Summer Game Fest, there's an immediate sense that the sequel is shaping up to be a much bigger, bolder, and indeed stranger experience than its predecessor.
As it probably should be. In speaking with developer Night School's founder and director, Sean Krankel, he confirmed that while the original Oxenfree was completed in 16 months, the sequel has taken the studio a full three years to craft. You can definitely see the fruits of the studio's labour, too, with this entry so far proving to be a much more accomplished piece of work in every facet: character models are much more detailed with enhanced animation; environments are brought to life with beautiful colour and lighting; the gameplay feels much smoother and more fluid than before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I forgot this was a thing!
Remember when studio Feral Interactive announced in 2021 that the Lara Croft Collection was coming to Switch in 2022? Me neither! Confirmed as a "collaboration" between Feral Games and Crystal Dynamics, the collection (which consists of two spinoff games featuring Tomb Raider hero Lara Croft) was delayed, seemingly indefinitely. But now it's back.
The latest news comes straight from a new trailer released by Feral Interactive, which definitively announces a June 29, 2023 release date. While the Switch version won't have any major extra features, it does still have four-player local co-op, among all of the other benefits of playing on Switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlq-VxMgza0
What even is the Lara Croft Collection that's coming to Switch?
As a reminder, this collection deals with the two isometric action romps:
Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light (2010)
Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris (2014)
We have reviews for both! And yes, one of them is over a decade old at this point. If you have local folks available, $24.99 isn't a bad price point for what will essentially amount to a weekend of isometric action fun. Each game will last you roughly five hours.
Comparison shopping for the Lara Croft Collection
You can find the collection on the Nintendo eShop now for $24.99.
You can pick up both of those games, as well as "every other Tomb Raider title ever released on PC" on Steam for $28.43 until June 26.
On Xbox, the Temple of Osiris + the season pass is on sale for under $5, and on the PSN the Temple of Osiris is available for $19.99.
Given the delistings of either game on some platforms (including iOS), the Switch port is making strides in the preservation department.

We're still writing about Zelda: Breath of the Wild news on occasion despite the fact that it's over six years old at this point, and Tears of the Kingdom's reach just might outlast it. Amid all of the frankly insane devices and creations we've seen the community come up with, this new wave of videos showcases another creative element: music.
How the community is creating music in Tears of the Kingdom
What the community is essentially doing is using stakes and lasers [beam emitters] (or other things) to create musical notes, which are then strung together through specific stake placements and item manipulation. Given how easy it is to head to a Zonai device dispenser, amass stakes, and save/quit in a field while experimenting, anyone who is willing can give it a shot.
Check out this short tutorial from Twitter user bran8bit.
https://twitter.com/bran8bit/status/1667539615413334017
Since then, the community at large took this knowledge and ran with it. Take this invention from Twitter user kabukichi00: they use an existing in-game platform to perfectly recreate the ever-present "Song of Storms" track.
https://twitter.com/kabukichi00/status/1668898001165877255
Another clip from kody_botw shows off how players can manually create music by lifting a laser cannon up with Ultrahand, and even play along with the background track.
https://twitter.com/kody_botw/status/1668587177973026817
Then there's this clip from noteabletony, who goes a step further and gets a minecart involved.
https://twitter.com/noteabletony/status/1668350921158320159
Welp, I still have more Street Fighter 6 and Diablo 4 to play, but this is my evening sorted! I suspect in just a week's time we're going to see a clip of an entire symphony recording out of this game somehow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the year’s best (and most literal) surprises, Hi-Fi Rush, is getting a free update that keeps the beat going with the addition of new modes and content. 
The “Arcade Challenge! Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. 


The first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. 
This update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. 
Hi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can read our review of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So quit the nail-bitin'
Following on from yesterday's confirmation that Persona 3 Reload is also headed to PlayStation and Steam platforms alongside its Xbox and Windows brethren, publisher Atlus has now let fans know that the intriguing — and pretty rad looking — Metaphor: ReFantazio is coming to the same platforms.
The port announcement was spotted by the eagle eyes of Gematsu over on the Korean Twitter of publisher Sega, though it seems both the tweet and the accompanying trailer including the port reveal have seemingly vanished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btHGCpUPjPk
Announced during the weekend's Xbox Games Showcase and developed by Studio Zero, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand-new fantasy franchise based around the concept of mirroring realities. While not all that much is known regarding the narrative and gameplay mechanics, the title coming from the producers of Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5 suggests that we'll get a wild, highly stylized adventure starring a cast of easily shippable and cosplay friend characters, and mucho dungeon crawling.
It's definitely one of the most surprising and exciting reveals of Summer Game Fest, and while its development probably means Persona 6 is on the back burner for the time being, Metaphor: ReFantazio is already turning heads with its dynamic, action-packed, and legitimately breathless trailer. I'm looking forward to Atlus lifting the curtain on this cool-looking universe.
Metaphor: ReFantazio is scheduled to launch in 2024 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

You might remember at the start of the week we realised that it was possible to make music in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by hitting a Zonai Stake with a beam, the pitch varying based on how deeply the stake is buried in the ground. In our original coverage, we predicted that "it will only be a matter of time before we see the concept pushed further" and sure enough, it has taken a mere three days for some players' creativity to amaze us all over again.
The first demonstration of the in-game build-your-own xylophone managed to get a little jingle up and running, but some players have since managed to use it to recreate some iconic Zelda tunes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure that describing Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors sounds like it’s betraying a terminal lack of imagination. But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. "It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.
And yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard not to!
We Love Katamari might be the perfect video game sequel. Dialing just about every beloved mechanic and detail from the first game up to 11, all while ditching some of Katamari Damacy’s less beloved aspects, it’s no surprise that this entry is the fan favorite. For better and worse, its re-release, We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie, asks you the question, “If it ain’t broke, why fix it?” With a handful of remixed levels, crisp HD graphics, and a smattering of quality-of-life features, Reroll + does its best to avoid stepping on the original’s toes while bringing the nearly 20-year-old game into the present day in clean, vibrant HD.
That new facelift might actually be We Love Katamari Reroll’s most significant addition. That’s not to say that the game didn’t look great back on PS2. In fact, its visuals have aged remarkably well compared to many of its contemporaries. It’s just that compared to modern consoles the PS2’s color palette and graphical capabilities lend a dim, washed-out look to even the brightest, most vibrantly multicolored games. Anyone who played the original back in the day might be shocked to hear that, but even a cursory search or glance at a Let’s Play might surprise you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are old games that are plain too hard to get into now, even I have to concede. Ancient ruins of a house to be admired and contemplated, but not fit to live in. The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. 
It's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.
What I'm saying is: it's still worth it.

The first of the two expansions, titled Haus, asks the question, "How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?" and answers that with "a techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore!". Sounds about right. This first expansion has quite a vague release window, expected to launch some time between October and December this year.

Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3 dropped recently with its Optimus Prime-flavored season pass, and there are more updates for Disney Dreamlight Valley (The Remembering), Rocket League (Season 11), Overwatch (Season 5), and Disney Speedstorm (Season 2). Wait, Disney Speedstorm just dropped Season 2?
It really is the "early summer of live service" so far, post-Zelda. One of the next big releases is Final Fantasy XVI on June 22 on PS5, which will end the streak. In terms of Switch games from AAA publishers, Crash Team Rumble is next on the slate on June 20.

Valve's biggest money spinner, Steam, is consistently being tweaked, and this latest update brings some visual changes to the client, as well as some new features. Whether you use the PC gaming storefront on desktop, mobile, or Steam Deck, you'll have noticed a few differences lately.
A short video highlights the new features that have been implemented. In a nutshell, the general layout has been given a "fresh coat of paint." Not so much that it doesn't look like Steam anymore. But is a bit different.

Valve has also made notifications "richer and more useful." Make of that what you will. You'll also notice the in-game overlay has been tweaked and now boasts more options for "better customization". One of the newest things to be added is a Notes feature which, as the name suggests, allows you to take notes during play. You can even pin it so it stays on top of your game in case you need to refer to it. There have also been some improvements to controller experiences as well, which adds a gamepad overlay and additional "virtual menus".
If you use Steam on Mac or Linux machines, the new update also enables hardware acceleration for these versions of the client, which should lead to a more responsive experience. That's according to the video, at least.
This latest update has been rolled out to all versions of Steam, including the official app. If you want to take a deep dive into the laundry list of changes that have been made recently, you can check out the full patch notes on the Steam website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much as I adored Theme Park, it's a bit of a weird game to have inspired so many descendants. The latest is Park Beyond, and for the most part it's exactly what you'd expect. Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.
That's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.

The latest Japanese charts are in, and it's another solid week for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Coming in at a further 46,644 copies sold, Nintendo's flagship title is comfortably ahead of Diablo IV, which sold a total of 41,839 across all platforms.
Speaking of Diablo IV, however, the Xbox version did not receive a physical release in Japan, so the total of 8,524 that you can see for Xbox in the software charts is purely for the Diablo IV hardware bundle. This also explains why the figure is so close to the Xbox Series X figure in the hardware chart.

The new mode joins the game as part of its 1.4 update, and looks to be all about what it says on the tin - being creative! Essentially, the big thing it lets you do is build your own unique voxel structures by, essentially, painting them in the air. Think of it as a sort of paired back, voxel-focused approach to a piece of 3D modelling software like Blender.

Both had faced up to 10 years behind bars but guilty pleas, cooperation and rehabilitation all played a part in reducing their sentences.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom made quite a lot of major changes to the formula established in Breath of the Wild. Yes, it still feels very familiar in the sense that you're exploring what is effectively the same environment, but entire regions have been altered, you can now go underground, and your power-ups have completely changed the way you interact with the environment.
Changes can be both big and small, however, and in our latest video, the lovely Felix has decided to go over 30 subtle differences between the two games that you might not have noticed yourself. Now, we should clarify that none of these are particularly groundbreaking and probably won't have you spitting out your coffee in shock, but they're definitely cool, regardless.

Life in the world of Mortal Kombat 1 sure moves fast — It was only a few weeks back that NetherRealm Studios revealed the latest release in the gory fighting franchise, and already we're entering the playable beta stages, with the game launching on PC and console platforms just three months from now.
And if the recent gameplay footage from Summer Game Fest whet your bloodthirsty appetite, you monster, then you could get the opportunity to play Mortal Kombat 1 for yourself next week, with the koming of a new "Online Stress Test", designed to put pressure on the new sequel-prequel's servers ahead of the launch period. The testing period will run from June 23-26 and will offer up one-on-one online action and limited Klassic Tower battles, obviously with something of an abridged roster.

If you want to throw your name in Kung Lao's razor hat, then head on over to the official website and register today. Interested parties will need a Warner Bros. gaming account, (you can register at the time if necessary), and the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test is only open to PS5 and Xbox Series X users in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Brazil. Lucky Kombatants will then receive access kodes to download the beta client at some point next week, ahead of the head-ripping khaos.
Mortal Kombat 1 launches September 14 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Our own Eric van Allen has already played a build of the exciting-looking scrapper, and you can read his thoughts right here.

RPG Site (via VGC) has spotted a banner on the Square Enix Support website that has a logo on it for Star Ocean: The Second Story R, which is presumably a remake of the 1998 action RPG Star Ocean: The Second Story on PS1. This hasn't actually been announced by the popular RPG developer, though. Oops.

So, I've gone and played another Sonic haven't I? This time I spent around 15-minutes with Sonic Superstars at this year's Summer Game Fest, a new 2.5D sidescroller that seems to successfully combine the feel of Sonic Mania with a modern art style and some new tricks. If you like old Sonic games, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love it. If you don't, there's no doubt in my mind you'll think it's agony.

It’s not everyday that we demo a game at an event and immediately ask to go back for seconds. The upcoming Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown managed to quickly sink its daggers into us with its punishing but rewarding combat, breathtaking vistas, and flashy animations. So naturally, we couldn’t walk away without taking another stab. This new Metroidvania-style take on the frenetic, spike-trap-dodging platformer is shaping up to be every bit as incredible as the genre it’s taken inspiration from — and all from a team that’s created some of Ubisoft’s best platformers.
Revealed in the opening moments of the Summer Game Fest 2023 live show, it's been 13 years since the series was last on consoles in The Forgotten Sands. Initial reaction to this new entry was somewhat divided, with some longtime fans disliking its presentation and others absolutely psyched to see the series return to its 2D roots. We went hands-on with a demo build at Ubisoft's Forward event and came away excited to play more.

A mysterious new logo is being shared online this morning, purportedly an as-yet-unannounced new project in the popular fantasy franchise, Star Ocean. As reported by RPGSite, a banner for a "Star Ocean The Second Story R" was first discovered on the support site of IP owner Square Enix.
Originally released for PlayStation in 1998, Star Ocean: The Second Story is, as the name suggests, the second entry in the action-RPG series, which won over fans with its sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, myriad paths and conclusions, and very heavy emphasis on dating mechanics between multiple characters, allowing players to essentially dictate both narrative and gameplay through the pairing (or not) of relationships.
The "R" in the new banner suggests that this popular release may be in line for the remake/remaster treatment, though obviously, Square Enix is yet to speak on the discovery. Back in 2019, the publisher released the similarly titled Star Ocean First Departure R on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, which was itself a remaster of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the first game in the series. Thus, a continuation along these lines is very likely, and very good news for Star Ocean fans.
Of course, we will be sure to keep you updated should Square Enix be forthcoming with any news.

It seems that every week from now until the end of time we are going to see something be built in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that will blow our Hylian socks off.
This started with Korok torture devices, swanky vehicles, and working Mechs, but all of that looks like child's play compared to what we have seen today from one player, who has managed to use the game's Zonai devices to build a fully-functional calculator —albeit a very basic one (thanks, Kotaku).

Valve announced the desktop update back in April, where the new version has been in beta for some Steam users to try out. In Valve's post from yesterday announcing the update is available for all, it did note that the "most impactful changes in this update aren’t immediately visible," as a lot of the work put into the update was today with how it "[shares] code across the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck." According to Valve, these changes should mean that future features should be more quickly implemented and iterated upon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Damned if you Don't
As part of yesterday's Grasshopper Manufacture 2023 live stream, the studio announced that its recently-revealed Shadows of the Damned: Remastered is "probably" going to be released on "all current platforms."
A typically tongue-in-cheek promo re-introduces us to Mexican demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who is not only "More terrifying than any demon", but is also "the most determined, devoted man in the world". So form a queue, ladies. The preview then describes Shadows of the Damned as "A nonstop-action love story taking you straight through the deepest depths of Hell". Sweet.
"Coming to all current platforms," concludes the preview, before adding "Probably."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THS60cC3768&t=270s&ab_channel=GrasshopperArchives
Elsewhere in the Grasshopper Direct, community manager James Mountain seemingly returns from the dead, while fellow CM Maddie Copp turns up cosplaying as No More Heroes' notorious Bad Girl. It also looks really hot under those studio lights. Of course, "Suda51" himself puts in an appearance, dazzlingly dressed in a lucha mask and green suit, reminiscent of Saints Row villain Killbane. Suda seemed a lot bigger and much more American than you may recall, but that's just your brain playing tricks on you, as it was definitely him. Even though he had a different face.

The show closed with a fleeting glimpse of the studio's next game, with viewers treated to what appears to be the in-game menu for the mystery project. While little can be divulged from the sneak peek, I did notice an "Emerald Flowsion" gauge, at least confirming that Goichi's love for pro-wrestling will continue to make its mark on all of the studio's output.
Shadows of the Damned: Remastered is currently in development for all platforms. Probably.

GB Studio Central — the online community-led publication that focuses on games created in the popular GB Studio — has announced that it's releasing a magazine. Yes, an actual magazine! And it's absolutely gorgeous.
Announced last week, GB Studio Magazine aims to curate articles from the GB Studio Central site and present them in beautiful paper form. Led by Eric Mack, presentation-wise, the magazine is meant to invoke Nintendo Power - which is plain to see from the lovely cover. The first cover features the characters and setting of GB Studio's in-built sample game, which is a nice little touch.

Atlus has a habit of putting restrictions in place when it comes to streaming its new game releases. While it's understandable in certain cases, in more recent times it's arguably got a bit heavy-handed in recent times with the re-releases of Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden.

Remnant: From The Ashes entered the looter-shooter space in 2019, defining its core loop with procedurally-segmented levels and Dark Souls-inspired mechanics like a stamina-based dodge roll and limited-use health consumables. Remnant’s fresh take on the shooter genre attracted praise, including Game Informer’s review which states, “Strong systems and a satisfying gameplay loop give Remnant: From The Ashes a powerful foundation, even if the experience is mired by repetitive and uninteresting bosses and environments.“

Now this is a premium option, with a normal price point of £999, but today with the 48HR20 code it's a slightly more palatable £799 at the Samsung UK store.

They have two PS1 titles on offer: Worms and Herc’s Adventures. This is alongside the PSP’s Killzone: Liberation. I mean, those games are something. They’re not nothing. You might consider Herc’s Adventures a hidden gem if you’re being generous.
Here’s a list of the games they’re headlining because they think no one cares about older titles:

It's nice to see the Prince of Persia series back in action. While the Sands of Time remake is still cooking, the series is going back to its 2D roots with The Lost Crown, an Ubisoft Montpellier project. And after playing a small slice of it, I'm pretty excited about the full game.
The Lost Crown feels like it pays homage to the foundation of Prince of Persia. The player takes up the role of Sargon, a new character who's part of an elite band of warriors looking for the kidnapped Prince Ghassan. In the demo I played as part of Ubisoft's presence in Los Angeles during Summer Game Fest 2023, I got a fairly good look at how Sargon's journey plays out. There's a whole lot of running, jumping, parrying, and plenty of spikes to dodge.

It's been quite a while since the last Armored Core. FromSoftware has been steadily working on successful Souls and Souls-like games, but the first Armored Core is one of its oldest titles. And now, years later, FromSoftware is returning to mech action with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon. And the series is certainly back.
We were invited to view a hands-off demo of a stage in Armored Core VI, where the player's mercenary needs to infiltrate and take command of a catapult held by a hostile faction. This means flying in and doing a whole lot of blasting. The progression still looks to be very Armored Core: it opens with a briefing, with lots of intel and screens, and then you're into the thick of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rogue Legacy 2 is one heck of a roguelike that only Xbox, Switch, and PC fans have enjoyed since it launched in 1.0 last year. Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.
Developer Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. 


We awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, "Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact."]]></summary>

If you're talking about some of the biggest arcade games of the '80s, names like Donkey Kong, Joust, Tempest, and even Mario Bros. may be brought up. But despite all of these classic titles, one arcade game has chomped more quarters than any of them: Pac-Man. Despite Pac-Man being most well-known for his original arcade cabinet, there are plenty of games in the Pac-Man series that go beyond the classic maze action gameplay of the original. From party games to racing titles to 3D platformers, he's done it all and then some. Here's our ranking for the Top 10 Pac-Man titles.

One of the best elements of fighting games is how much their characters and worlds lend themselves to the creativity of the fan community, who adapt the games and lore to their own artistic projects and showcases — Case in point, this great cosplay video, which sees a handful of World Warriors gather together to celebrate the launch of Capcom's Street Fighter 6.
Directed by D Piddy, shot by Alive Alf, and starring a bevy of notable cosplayers, the cosplay video sees a host of Street Fighter 6 characters, squaring up in preparation for the new tournament. While the video mostly centers on poster boy Luke, (portrayed by Johnny Junkers), and a busy day in the life of a street fighter, we also get appearances from Chun-Li (Caytie Cosplay), Zangief (Bane Armstrong), Cammy (Vamplettes), and Kimberly (Jahara Jayde - No Pout).
D Piddy themselves also takes to the floor as the tonic-gushing vigilante, Jamie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjR_iqxgZbY
Luke's day is busy enough, but it's thrown into full chaos by the arrival of Juri Han (Jane Sin), which leads to a brief throwdown between pals. Additionally, Manon (Kitty Kaboom) does a spot of couture shopping, and even Sakura (Lucky Lai) pops her head up to remind Capcom she needs to be added as DLC. The whole shebang is backed by the official Street Fighter 6 theme song "Not on the Sidelines" by Rocco 808 & Randy Marx.
Check it out, a lot of wonderful, creative talent on display.
You can keep up to speed on more of D Piddy's projects over on their official Twitter.
Street Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Be sure to check out our newly launched and ever-growing guide hub for hints and tips on all of the game’s main modes, as well as my thoughts on who needs to join the roster post-launch.

Atari is a company that has almost always been mired in problems. Before the Atari VCS (2600) console even launched, founder Nolan Bushnell sold the business to Warner Communications, which fired him shortly thereafter. It’s traded hands throughout the years, eventually landing with Infogrames in 2000, who gradually rebranded to the Atari name before nearly becoming bankrupt in 2013. They restructured, sold off a number of assets, and managed to come out of bankruptcy.
Say what you will about the Atari Lynx and Jaguar platforms, but nothing is as bad as post-bankruptcy protection Atari. They oversaw such tragic releases as Haunted House: Cryptic Graves and Asteroids: Outpost. Atari’s business model also shifted heavily toward micro-monetized mobile games.

Animation studio Bobbypills is teaming up with Evil Empire and Motion Twin, to create a Dead Cells animated series which will air in 2024. The series will consist of 10 seven-minute-long episodes and will initially stream on ADN (which is also co-producing the show) in France before being made available worldwide afterwards.
We don't know a lot about the upcoming series at the moment (not even its official title), but the above teaser trailer does show off the 2D visual style that we can expect to see the show adopt. A brief synopsis (found below) suggests that the series will be sticking relatively close to the source material, but for a game so defined by its mechanics, there really is room for the story to go anywhere.

Cellar Door Games has finally announced a release date for the PlayStation port of epic medieval roguelike Rogue Legacy 2 — Our brave army of knights will attempt to surmount an ever-changing kingdom of monsters on June 20, just under a week from today.
Originally released on PC and Nintendo Switch in the spring of 2022, Rogue Legacy 2 once again sees players guide a plucky knight through dungeon after dungeon, battling ghosts, ghouls, and monsters, and picking their way toward an array of dangerous boss characters. As with its predecessor, death is only beginning, and each fallen knight will be replaced by the next in their bloodline, many of whom carry their own unique quirks and abilities, known in-game as "Traits".

Added to the sequel are several new features, including the Metroidvania-type "Heirlooms", allowing access to certain out-of-reach areas, and an expanded narrative that runs beyond the original run and into several New Game+ efforts. While the sequel is obviously over a year old, it's a truly golden title, and well worth checking out by all adventure fans, regardless of your experience with the roguelike genre or the Rogue Legacy franchise. Lead on, adventurer!
Rogue Legacy 2 launches on PlayStation June 20. It is available now on PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

It looks like the expansive LEGO gaming universe is about to stretch out onto the football pitch, as the ever-faithful spoilers over at The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea has uploaded a new listing for an as-yet-unannounced title, LEGO 2K Goooal!
As this is just a ratings board listing, there is very little info to go on. But we're clearly looking at a soccer title set within the creative building block world of LEGO. This leak ties in with an earlier report by VGC that revealed The LEGO Company was entering a partnership with 2K Games in order to develop a series of titles based around recreational sports. Visual Concepts' LEGO 2K Drive, which was released last month, is the first title in this range, and LEGO 2K Goooal! appears to be next in line.
We can expect an official announcement of LEGO 2K Goooal! from 2K Games and developer Sumo Digital at some point in the near-future, perhaps during a summer event such as Gamescom 2023.

If you weren't already excited for Sonic Superstars — the brand new 2D Sonic game, announced at last week's Summer Game Fest — then this news should get you rushing for those red sneakers.
Christian Whitehead, the lead developer on Sonic Mania, has confirmed that the physics of Headcannon's 2017 retro hit has been "fully translated to modern 3D" in response to comparisons of the physics of classic Sonic games to Superstars' own. This means that the Retro Engine, used in Mania, the 2011 Sonic CD port, the mobile version of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and in Origins, is being used for Superstars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expect lots of dodge rolls
Motion Twin has announced that their indie mega-hit, Dead Cells, is getting the animation treatment in 2024.
The 10-episode series is being handled by Bobbypills, the group that handled all of Dead Cells’ animated trailers. The Animation Digital Network will be co-producing. Right now, we have a short teaser trailer of the prisoner sitting on a pile of corpses attempting to spark their head back to life. This comes complete with the sound of someone flicking a cheap lighter.
https://twitter.com/motiontwin/status/1668982072797454338?s=20
That’s not much to go on, admittedly, but despite being a roguelite, Dead Cells has a lot of lore to draw from. It also has a lot of memorable characters to draw from, like, uh, that one lady who dies. Or maybe that guy who… Crap.
I’m going to be honest with you. I picked up Dead Cells for their Return to Castlevania DLC, and I loved the heck out of it. Once I finished with Return to Castlevania, it was my intention to continue on through the rest of the content. I guess it was a busy time for me because I just didn’t do that. When was that? March? Oh, yeah. I did 12 reviews that month. That wasn’t a very good idea.
However, my time spent with it does leave me convinced that it could be adapted into a very watchable animated series. No word on whether or not you have to start from the beginning if you fail to watch the series from start to finish.
The Dead Cells animated series will arrive sometime in 2024. The show will premiere exclusively on French network ADN, before screening worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells joins the growing list of video games getting animated series adaptations with a show based on the popular action roguelike slated to arrive next year.
This series comes from French animation studio Bobbypills, which is also animating Netflix’s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired Captain Laserhawk. Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. 


Dead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. 
For more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.]]></summary>

One of the surprise success stories of 2022, Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush, is getting to set to unleash a fresh wave of day-glo color and block-rockin' beats, with the arrival of the Arcade Challenge update — Available to download next month, free of charge, on PC and Xbox platforms.
As revealed during yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase extension, the new update will bring two exciting new modes to the highly dynamic hack 'n' slasher. BPM Rush will task players with battling wave after wave of increasingly tough opponents, with bonus points awards for synching the battle to the beat. Stay on your toes, however, as the BPM will increase with each and every wave, and only the most rhythmic melee warriors will be able to keep the pace in this unique-looking endurance test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dU394xpvU
The second mode Power Up! Tower Up! is a variant of Hi-Fi Rush's Rhythm Tower mode, and adds a slew of power-ups and bugs to the battle. Chai will be able to select from a variety of buffs and nerfs between rounds at the cost (or increase of) their score multipliers and other bonuses. Essentially, it is up to the player to increase their powers in exchange for a higher score, or to conversely reduce their own abilities for the big, big numbers.
In addition to the two modes, new challenges arrive that will reward players with clothing for Chai and Korsica, new poses and filters for Photo Mode, and all-new special attacks that see an assist from robo-friendos CNMN and Smidge. Get by with a little help from you friends indeed. You can check out all of this cool content for free when the Hi-Fi Rush Arcade Challenge update drops on July 5.
Hi-Fi Rush is available now on PC, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass.

Persona 3 Reload, the ground-up remake of Persona 3, will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 in addition to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game will launch in early 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its reveal during Xbox Games Showcase, Capcom have given us a few details on their upcoming game Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess. When it was first announced on Sunday, we knew very little about the game other than it looks very pretty, and we've been eager to know more ever since. The game also opened Capcom's own showcase the next day, where the same trailer was shown and we didn't get any new information on it. Very enlightening. But luckily, some more details have dripped through, which we've summarised below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only a whole year to wait
Summer Game Fest 2023 is about ready to wrap up, but Geoff Keighley is already preparing people for next year's event. If you managed to check out, and enjoy, the showcases that have been broadcasting recently, you may well be excited for SGF's return in 2024. Actually, the event is even technically over yet, as Annapurna's showcase is still to come.
Not only is Keighley eager to announce that Summer Game Fest will be back in June of next year, he goes on to say that this year's event was "record-setting." Not quite certain what that means, but it likely refers to the amount of people who attended the event, both in person and online. Given the dry spell from gaming conventions over the past two or three years, it wouldn't be surprising to see the likes of SGF see an uptick in attendees.
https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1668638357608628225
Currently, there are no details about the 2024 showcases, other than it will obviously be hosted by Keighley himself. There will also be the return of Play Days from studio iam8bit, but again, details won't be announced until further down the line.
Summer Game Fest 2023 saw a lot of content from a variety of studios, publishers, and industry experts. Trailers from the likes of Alan Wake 2, Mortal Kombat 1, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and lots more were on display. There was also the Day of the Dev event, hosted by iam8bit and Double Fine, which gave indie studios the opportunity to showcase what they've been working on.
With E3 being cancelled this year — perhaps never to return — that leaves the space open for SGF and other expos to continue their dominance of the summer period. See you all for Gamescom 2023.

Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?
Having seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.

We now have confirmation that Atlus' upcoming remake Persona 3 Reload will be coming to PlayStation and Steam platforms alongside its previously announced Xbox and Windows editions. The new ports appeared on the official site in a CERO ratings listing, which was then followed by an updated trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RycGltKqjg
While this will hardly come as a surprise to most, there were still many only panicking that perhaps the black-and-blue brand would not be making the return journey to Tartarus. Frankly, this wasn't going to happen, not when there is so much cash to be made, but at least those who were concerned can rest easy that they will be revisiting The Dark Hour with Messrs Makoto, Junpei, Mitsuru, and company.
First leaked during Summer Game Fest, before being officially announced during Sunday's Xbox Game Showcase, Persona 3 Reload is a full remake of the 2006 PS2 classic. While fans have been craving this title for some title, the hype has been somewhat quashed by the revelation that Reload will not feature any of the content from expanded edition Persona 3 FES, nor the Persona 3 Portable release, which included the much-loved female protagonist, known to the community as "FemC".
Persona 3 Reload will launch in early 2024 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Additionally, Persona 5 Tactica will launch on the aforementioned platforms and Nintendo Switch.

Does it deserve those eyeballs, then? After playing an early version of it myself, I sure think so.

As you'll have seen from my big preview, the game itself is a 2.5D platformer that mixes 3D character models and environments with sidescrolling action and dramatic camera movements as hero Sargon doles out his suite of special attacks. But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games. So I put the question to art director Jean-Christophe Alessandri and game director Mounir Radi after my demo session.

[Update: The FTC has been officially granted the injunction filed against Microsoft. As such, Microsoft cannot complete its purchase of Activision Blizzard until the case reaches Federal Court in August.]
The United States Federal Trade Commission has requested that U.S. place an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing its proposed purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard before the FTC's antitrust lawsuit, set to take place this August.
Despite the legal opposition from the commission, as well as the approval rejection from the UK, The FTC believes Microsoft fully intends to go ahead and complete the $68.7 billion merger, and that "they may consummate the proposed acquisition at any time". The FTC filed suit against Microsoft back in December 2022, but the case is still yet to be heard in court.
The FTC has asked for an injunction preventing the sale from taking place be filed no later than June 15, and that said injunction remain in place until the court makes its decision later this summer.
In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Microsoft president Brad Smith writes: "We welcome the opportunity to present our case in federal court. We believe accelerating the legal process in the U.S. will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market."
The FTC continues to build its case against the proposed sale ahead of August's hearing. The commission is expected to present arguments that Microsoft's ownership of the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft studio will create something of a monopoly within the industry, limiting player choice and confining popular brands to MS own platforms. Microsoft has repeatedly denied that this is the intent behind its proposed purchase.
Pretrial briefs are expected to take place in July, with the court officially opening August 2.

If you want to see what procrastination looks like, put 1998's Fighter Maker in front of me. If you ever noticed me miss a week with these Kusoge articles, it’s probably because I planned to cover Fighter Maker that week and just couldn’t bring myself to play it. Never has a bad game asked me for so much commitment.
Blame The Industry’s Chris Moyse. It was his suggestion. Considering he’s the leading expert on all things fists, I trust him when he tells me a fighting game is going to be bad. And Fighter Maker is… Well, maybe not bad, but it’s extremely misguided.
Fighter Maker is part of the ASCII Entertainment “Maker” series. That kind of makes it sound like it covered a lot of genres, but really it was just rail shooter, fighting game, and RPG. The RPG Maker games had the …]]></summary>

Over the years, "Action RPG" games have evolved quite a bit, adding more and more player customization with each new entry into the genre. Diablo 3 released in 2012 with over a billion unique build possibilities across all of its classes. Hit ARPG Path of Exile has been constantly adding new abilities via its unique skill gem system for almost ten years.
As we began to learn more about Diablo 4 leading up to its release, just one week ago, it quickly became apparent we'd once again get a massive amount of potential builds. With five classes each with their own unique skill trees full of active and passive skills, the possibilities seemed endless.

Bandai Namco has confirmed that its 2012 sword-swinger Soulcalibur V is to be delisted from digital storefronts next week. As of Monday, June 19, the fighting sequel and its DLC will no longer be available to purchase from the PlayStation and Xbox stores.
"Valiant Warriors - Soul Calibur V is taking its final curtain call on the stage of history and will be sunset on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 19, 2023," said the publisher on Twitter. "The base game and all associated DLC will no longer be available for purchase. Thank you for your continued support."
https://twitter.com/soulcalibur/status/1668075650299879424?s=20
While it was neither confirmed nor denied by Bandai Namco, it is assumed that all players who have purchased the title will still have access to the game. Soulcalibur V is not a backward-compatible game for modern platforms, nor is it a part of Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. As such, the delisting only affects the native PS3/Xbox 360 users. Better hold on to those discs, archivists.
The most recent entry in the franchise, Soulcalibur VI, launched in 2018 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

Set two years after saving Earth from an alien cartel, the aptly named High On Knife DLC introduces a bit of spooky horror to the largely comedy-centric game. We got a brief teaser trailer to show what level of scares we can expect from this new adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An added golden epilogue
It's been just over a year since Square Enix released its HD-2D turn-based tactics game Triangle Strategy. And now, fans who have put some time into the tactics can get a little bonus for their trouble.
A Version 1.1.0 update has rolled out for Triangle Strategy on available platforms, adding a few different features. For those who want to re-experience the big events of Triangle Strategy, there are replay options for both chapters and story battles.
But also arriving as part of the update is an Extra Story option. This bonus chapter appears on the title screen, but only after you've completed the Serenoa route of Triangle Strategy.
If you haven't played the game or have only seen it through once, you might not be aware of this route. The Serenoa route is Triangle Strategy's "golden route," where the protagonist Serenoa finds an option to resolve all the great mysteries and conflicts that surround the ongoing war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nhTJ-Evv_U
To get that, you'll need to make certain choices throughout the game, and be ready to see them through. Doing so will unlock this new extra chapter, which serves as a golden epilogue of sorts.
Return to the battlefield
Alongside content updates, Square Enix also says that some battle adjustments have been made for repeat playthroughs. Other options have been added, that all seem to make repeat playthroughs a bit smoother to run through. It's nice, considering many players who are going for the golden route are likely doing so on a second run.
I'm happy to see Triangle Strategy get this update, though. It's remained a memorable, solid tactics experience both on the Switch and other platforms. Any sort of follow-up or sequel speculation aside, I'm happy to see the Triangle Strategy team is being given the room to make these post-launch updates so far out, as little treats for fans who dug this far into the game.

After six years of massive open-world RPGs, Ubisoft’s long-running Assassin’s Creed franchise is returning to its stealth-based, dense city roots with Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the more I see of it, the more excited I get for October. I’ve enjoyed the series’ foray into RPGs over the years, but 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which took me more than 100 hours to roll credits on, left me exhausted and burnt out with what Ubisoft had done to a franchise whose games previously took 20 hours to beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It sounds like Xbox really wants Starfield to be as bug free as possible, as apparently every QA staff member is working on the game. This comes from Giant Bomb, who spoke with Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty and Xbox boss Phil Spencer. The two spoke about a range of topics to do with Xbox as a whole, but Booty notably claimed that Starfield would be the Bethesda game with the least amount of bugs the developer has ever shipped.

So now Hellsinger offers a poppier experience with a new DLC letting you perform violence to the sounds of Gorillaz, Depeche Mode, Icona Pop, and more. Oh, and Down With The Sickness is in there too because hell, why not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a proper look at Starfield (which my brain autocorrects to "Garfield" every single time I read it) on Sunday thanks to a dedicated 45 minute long presentation that showcased the game's various systems, planets and characters in granular detail. 45 minutes is a long time to devote to one video game, you could argue. Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? 
Anyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it? Who needs Todd Howard when you can listen to me, a tired man wearing an unironed t-shirt, telling you about the game instead.

The developer announced the news that the much-delayed game would be receiving a beta alongside a… sea shanty, which is obviously fitting given the whole it being a pirate game thing, but is maybe the funniest way of doing such an announcement for a game that seems like it's never coming out. You can currently sign up to potentially join the closed beta on the game's website, with the test set to take place August 25-28.

Embracer own 138 studios and have over 16,500 people working for them, and it's not clear how many will remain afterwards.

Blizzard's Overwatch 2 dev team ignited the community last month when it announced that the Hero Missions, part of the PvE content that was announced alongside the game in 2019, were canceled. However, not all of the PvE content was axed. I traveled to Blizzard's headquarters in Irvine, California to be the first person outside of the company to get my hands on the upcoming Story Missions.
The Story Missions take place during the invasion of the Null Sector, the rogue Omnic group. Overwatch 2: Invasion is the name of t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.
The collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.


The Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.
Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pragmata may be the most mysterious title in Capcom's upcoming portfolio of games, and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future. A brief update during the Capcom Showcase confirmed the game's release was slipping out of 2023 and into the unknown.


The video shows the enigmatic, glowy-eyed little girl (apparently named Diana) innocently drawing as her decidedly adult astronaut(?) guardian fends off mechanized attackers before he whisks her away from danger. We then see her doodle is a cute vehicle to break the bad news, followed by a more formal message from the development team stating...
It is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release of Pragmata.
Our team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.
Thank you for your continued support.
-The Pragmata Development Team
Pragmata was first announced in 2020, and we still know next to nothing about it. So far, we've seen that some kind of catastrophe has befallen Earth, and the game unfolds in a "near-future dystopian world on the moon," according to Capcom. The game was originally slated for 2022 before getting delayed to 2023. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that last-gen graphics cards are getting huge discounts at the moment, as pent-up demand has been sated and next-generation models are starting to be released from both Nvidia and AMD's lineups. We've covered more mid-range models before, but today we have something a bit different: a truly mainstream graphics card that delivers excellent 1080p performance at less than £200, plus nice extras like ray-tracing hardware, FSR 2 image upscaling and a modern media encoder for streaming and recording gameplay. 
I'm talking about the AMD Radeon RX 6600, which is available in the popular Sapphire Pulse configuration for £180 plus £8 shipping over at Overclockers UK - with a free copy of the Resident Evil 4 remake. This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago. Nice!

Since the reveal of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2021, I’ve been curious how The Division developer Ubisoft Massive will take on this property, one of the most financially successful movie franchises in the world, and translate it into a video game. Knowing Ubisoft’s pedigree, I imagined what Frontiers of Pandora might look like: something between Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry. After a special behind-closed-doors presentation during Ubisoft’s summer gaming event, I can say I was spot on.

I am a man who understands only that there are lanky Smurfs who live in a world you'd get if you mashed Halo and Viva Piñata together. So, having seen roughly 30 minutes of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, I can give you the unfettered lowdown of a person who's analysed it with a cold, hard stare. In brief, the game looks rather lovely! If… too lovely. I worry there's a big catch somewhere and I can't put my finger on it.

There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a "true" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft decided to round out its showcase with a closer look at a game it revealed during the Xbox showcase yesterday – Star Wars Outlaws. The reveal shows smuggler Kay Vess sneaking and shooting her way through a galaxy far far away. There's a lot going on in this trailer, so let's break it down.
The demonstration starts with Kay trying to make her way out of a deadly situation. While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind. It's exciting to see a companion like that as more than just a cute, (hopefu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Ubisoft's Foward event, we got a new look at gameplay from Assassin's Creed Mirage – a throwback of sorts to the long-running series' roots. 
In the footage, we see a few assassinations, a chase, and our protagonist Basim taking on missions. There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.
Check out the gameplay footage below.


Notably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.
You can also check out a new trailer for the game below.


Assassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward provided some new glimpses at two of its other upcoming Assassin’s Creed projects.
First up is Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, which comes to Meta Quest 2 and 3 later this year. The game lets players control Ezio (AC II), Connor (AC III), and Kassandra (AC: Odyssey) in first-person through an original story that lets players parkour, hide in the shadows, and assassinate targets in the more immersive avenue that VR provides. Check out the CG trailer below. 


We next saw footage of gameplay from Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade, the free-to-play mobile title set in ancient China that was announced last September. The brief montage showed off shots of the detailed open world and the signature assassin’s gameplay. Jade is the first title that lets the player build their own protagonist from scratch, and you can register now to join the game’s first playable beta.]]></summary>

Players will explore the city of Honolulu, drive up volcanic rocks, and along beachsides. It seems clear that The Crew Motorfest has drawn at least some inspiration from the destination-focused gameplay of other racing games like Forza Horizon.
The game is also embracing the focus on car collection, including an option to import your car collection from the prior Crew game.
The Crew Motorfest is targeting a beta in July, so players should be able to get a better sense of the racing action in just a few weeks. The game is out on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-12T17:44:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a series of closed beta periods, XDefiant is ready for public testing. Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
XDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora kicked off Ubisoft Forward with a new trailer providing our best look at the game yet.
Frontiers of Pandora follows the narrative blueprint of the films in that you control a Na’vi to protect your world from militaristic human invaders. The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.


The game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. 
We also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

And sometimes, all you need from a sequel is the first one, but a bit bigger and bit better. Having spent a few hours with third-person co-op shooter Remnant 2, I reckon it's shaping up to be exactly those two things. It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care. From what I've played, it's more about being the looter shooter for those who care about fine-tuning the consistency of the numbers they're able to extract from their foes.

The second segment is a  2-hour long action-focused mission centering on Clive’s infiltration of a fort. While the progress from this section will not transfer to the final game, it does provide a hefty sample of the game’s stylish-action-inspired combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me tell you, being at an Xbox Games Showcase in-person is quite the experience. I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.
The countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, "five, four, three!", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of "Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.

During Summer Game Fest 2023, I had a chance to get a behind-closed-doors look at Alan Wake, the highly anticipated sequel 13 years in the making.
The road to Alan Wake 2 was full of speed bumps involving publishing rights and finding the right ideas, hence the 13-year gap. "We've been trying and now finally everything just clicked into place," co-director Sam Lake says. "We got the publishing rights of the original game back, so we were in a position to create a remastered version for the PlayStation audience as well as a wider audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of the launch of its Steam Next Fest demo next week, I've been playing a substantial early build of Mimimi Games' latest stealth strategy game, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. 
As you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th.

Oh, Diablo 4? It’s alright, yeah. Quite fun. But it’s recently taken a backseat to something far more illustrious. His name, the subtitles inform me, is Denysov, and he lives in Diablo IV's world of Sanctuary.

Diesel Legacy: The Brazen Age is here to fix that, mixing up the classic punch 'em up formula with three lanes for you to manoeuvre around during 2v2 fights.

Earthless is a roguelike deckbuilder from Blackbird Interactive, although you wouldn't know it from the cinematic teaser trailer shown at the PC Gaming Show tonight, which was heavy on the dramatic yet hopeful voiceover. As the captain of the fleet, your job is to lead everyone to a safe harbour.

It looks like a very mean game, and I'm sure I'm going to love every second of it when it comes out, which was confirmed as 2024 during the PC Gaming Show. You can check out the trailer below.

This accompanies news that the fantasy RTS will run a multiplayer open beta test over the weekend of July 7-10. That will let every orrible scrote in to play 1v1 matches as either the Orruk Kruleboyz or Stormcast Eternals. That's basically Orks vs. Space Marines except their swords aren't chainsaws, okay.

You can also imagine my excitement when they said it would be out later this year, too. Not in 2024, or several years down the line, but in the next 12 months. Absolutely my favourite thing in the world, reveals like that. Can't get enough of them. So picture how I must be feeling right now, having just heard Shadow Gambit's actual release date at tonight's PC Gaming Show. Time to mark your calendars, folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors just can't seem to die, but it's unclear whether that's due to its attentive development team or the immortal nature of vampires. Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.


The update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.
Vampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. For more on the game, check out why we gave it such a high review, or learn about its upcoming TV adaptation.]]></summary>

I adored the first one - and even picked it for May's RPS Game Club - but the prospect of a sequel seemed almost too good to be true. Happily, tonight's PC Gaming Show brought the news I was waiting for. After a dramatic animated trailer reveal, I'm happy to report that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is indeed a real thing, and I spoke to Damian Martin earlier this week to find out all about it.

Thirsty Suitors has been on my radar since its reveal a few years ago. It mixes a beautiful, unique, and saturated visual style, turn-based combat, great voice acting, and skateboarding. It’s a busy mix on paper, but after playing it for roughly 30 minutes during Summer Games Fest, I’m walking away excited for more. 
After a rough breakup, protagonist Jala returns home. But doing so isn’t easy because that former relationship created turmoil in her other relationships back home, including her parents, sister, friends, and more. Now home, Jala seeks to repair these…]]></summary>

Alongside a fresh look at the game's 1000 planets, combat and skill trees, we were given a closer peek at arguably the most important part of the whole game: its character creator.


Described as the "simplest character creator" the team have ever made, Starfield will let you dig into the finer details of your space captain's face, right down to their teeth for reasons I can't quite work out yet. An improvement on the creators found in previous Bethesda games, there's nothing here that looks particularly innovative compared to other open-world games of this ilk. What's interesting is that this time around, the team have used the in-game tool to create every last one of Starfield's NPCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During an Xbox panel called "What's Next for Gaming," head of Xbox Phil Spencer was asked by the moderator for the current status of the drawn-out process of attempting to acquire Activision Blizzard.
"So, it's been a long journey," Spencer said. "I have to admit that when we started this, some of us up here, maybe more than 18 months ago were thinking about where our strategy was and what we could add to our capability. That Activision Blizzard King acquisition, I'll just be honest, it's been a real learning experience for me in a good way. And so many people up here – [head of Xbox Game Studios] Matt [Booty] and [corporate vice president] Sarah [Bond] – have spent a lot of time leading and strategizing and thinking about where we are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["So why go this big with Starfield?" asks Bethesda Softworks' lead landscape artist Matt Carofano at the beginning of a segment in tonight's Starfield Direct. "Because we want to give you freedom on a galactic level," is the unsatisfying response. 

Starfield features over 1000 planets to visit, each procedurally generated upon your approach but populated with handcrafted elements. Your "freedom" upon landing on these planets - many of which seem near-barren - is whether you spend your time doing some quests, 'surveying' the local flora and fauna, or shooting rocks with your space laser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After learning that the Citizen Sleeper team had another game in the works, we were excited to try whatever came next, whenever that was. Today's PC Gaming Show gave us an exciting update, and much sooner than we might have expected: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is currently in development.


The sequel takes place in the same world as the last, "some time" after the events Citizen Sleeper. As an escaped android with a malfunctioning body, you'll have to gather a crew, command a ship, and do what it takes to stay alive. If you want to keep an eye out for future updates, the game already has a Steam page.
If this game is anything like its predecessor, we're all in for a treat. We were big fans of the original Citizen Sleeper, with its inspired story and narrative mechanics leading to our reviewer calling it "a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." It also scored a spot on our Top Ten Games of 2022.]]></summary>

At the combined Xbox Games Showcase slash Starfield Direct tonight, Bethesda did a deep dive on a few aspects of their upcoming space RPG Starfield - including the companion system. Although, given that you assign them to different tasks on your ship and various outposts, it might be more appropriate to call them "employees". Although again, you can romance some of them, which is definitely an HR issue.

The good news is that you'll soon be able to do exactly that, as tonight's PC Gaming Show confirmed that Jumplight Odyssey will be getting a Steam Next Fest demo on June 19th. That's just over a week away at time of writing, and having played an early version of that demo myself, I'm pleased to report that it's shaping up very nicely indeed - even if my first attempt ended in catastrophic disaster after I was boarded by half a dozen crews of angry green alien lads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clockwork Revolution made its debut at today’s Xbox Games Showcase via a trailer that set the stage for its steampunk-flavored RPG action.
The first-person adventure puts you in control of a woman hailing from the steam-powered Victorian-era city of Avalon who discovers a time machine, along with the revelation that the city – and its brutal oppression of the lower class – is the result of intricate time manipulation by the villainous Lady Ironwood. To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. 


The game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. 
Clockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.]]></summary>

This carbon black version of the slimmer Xbox boasts roughly double the storage of its original white counterpart. That also means it’s more expensive, retailing for a hundred bucks more at $349.
As a reminder, the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive. It's also weaker than the $500 Series X, but even this new version remains a decent budget option for those looking to enter the current generation of gaming.

The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.
The new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.

The Persona 5 tactics game, called Persona 5 Tactica, releases this year, on November 17. It appears to be a continuation of the stories from Persona 5 and Persona 5 Strikers and adds a new mysterious member to the crew, but with a new chibi art style and grid-based tactics gameplay. Persona 5 Tactica will also be available on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, Payday 3 has a release date. Today during the Xbox Games Showcase, it was announced that the multiplayer bank-robber simulator will be coming out on September 21. 
Aside from a date, a flashy new trailer showed plenty of the robbery and action mechanics off. As you might've guessed, it sure does look like another Payday. Check it out below:


Payday 3 was announced all the way back in 2016 and has been stuck in development hell ever since. Apparently, it's set in a "living, enormous representation" of New York City."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an accidental early posting earlier this week on Atlus' official Instagram accounts, the remake of Persona 3 is officially real.


The Persona 3 remake is called Persona 3 Reload and is being made in Unreal Engine. The footage of the game points to it being a total, from-the-ground-up remake, which might explain why the recent re-release of Persona 3 on modern platforms was somewhat underwhelming. The game is set to release in early 2024 and will be available on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compulsion Games, makers of We Happy Few and Contrast, has announced a fascinating new project called South of Midnight.
The stylish trailer begins with a strange (and giant) musician strumming his guitar surrounded by forest critters in a bayou-like swamp. A young woman pays a visit to inquire about a dangerous monster, which attempts to ambush her until she retaliates by weaving a seemingly magical web to subdue it. There's no gameplay, and the trailer's description describes South of Midnight as a "fantastical and macabre third-person action-adventure set in the American Deep South."


South of Midnight has no release window, but it’s coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S and will launch on Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during the Xbox Showcase, we finally got a look at the open-world Star Wars game Ubisoft has been working on for the last few years. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio known for making The Division and The Division 2. The cinematic reveal trailer didn't show any gameplay, instead relying on cgi cutscenes to set the mood of the world, showing a young woman on the run from a bounty hunter. You can watch it for yourself below.


The description of the trailer on YouTube offers some more concrete details about the game.
"Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars game, set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi," the description says. "Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. Fight, steal, and outwit your way through the galaxy’s crime syndicates as you join the galaxy’s most wanted."
While the new title isn't out until 2024, we'll be learning more about it at Ubisoft's showcase tomorrow. For the full lineup of showcases this month, check out our streaming schedule.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Fable from Playground Games was previously announced, but the latest trailer gives us a better sense of the game's comedic tone. The trailer (but not the full game, presumably) stars Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd fame as Dave commiserating about the age of heroes being over and the age of agriculture being the future. In a twist, however, it is revealed that Ayoade's character is a giant fending off heroes who are trying to invade his home.


From there an action sequence begins with a hero outrunning the giant Ayoade. It is revealed in the end that the hero has defeated the giant by show of them sitting on his shattered glasses. The trailer's description on YouTube shares that this new entry will continue to take place in Albion.
No release date was revealed, but the game will be available on Game Pass day one.]]></summary>

Since Cocoon’s reveal last year, I’ve been excited to one day check it out. Coming from Jeppe Carlsen, a former lead designer behind Playdead’s Limbo and Inside, its reveal trailer in 2022 made splashes amongst fans of the games Carlsen worked on. During Summer Games Fest this year, I finally got to play roughly 30 minutes of this strange, sci-fi puzzle game, and I don’t think it could have made a better first hands-on impression. 
Immediately, Cocoon’s visual style is striking. Its minimalist sci-fi aesthetic feels right at home within the lineage of Playdead games, although it’s import…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy classic 3D platformers and games that let you creatively tinker with their worlds, you may want to put Ruffy and the Riverside on your radar. This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.
As Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. 


In addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Future Games Show closed out with a new trailer for The Spirit of the Samurai, an eye-catching stop-motion 2D Metroidvania-style action game coming next year.


The game’s striking stop-motion presentation immediately stands out, paying homage to the classic model animation of Ray Harryhausen films, such as Mighty Joe Young, Jason and the Argonauts, and Clash of the Titans. Players guide three very different characters – a samurai, a Kodama spirit, and a cat – on a journey to save Japan from invading Oni. As the samurai Takeshi and the much smaller Kodoma, you’ll hack apart undead soldiers and supernatural foes from Japanese mythology. As the cat, platforming and stealth are the names of the game, as you’ll avoid enemies such as one, particularly toothy and terrifying-looking demon. 
The Spirit of the Samurai has been in the works for a few years by developer Digital Mind Games and arrives in 2024 for PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
