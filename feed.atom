Luckily, the trailers and a few comments from the series' creators have painted a pretty clear picture of when Skeleton Crew takes place in Star Wars canon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All Hallows Eve has come and gone again, and many ghoulish connoisseurs of quality literature will now be hunting for ways to keep the Halloween spirit alive. Luckily, DC Comics has long supported the horror genre, delivering some of the most frightening forays into the macabre and housing a collection of the most terrifying tomes on the fiendish and occult.


Indeed, with everything from psychological thrillers to more traditional examples of monstrous denizens, DC has earned its terrifying reputation for delivering during the Halloween season. As a decades-long lover of DC and horror, I will utilize my accumulated knowledge, cleaving through the excess and narrowing down the best, most spooktacular comic reads; continue reading if you dare.

So many games have come out since then, and the industry has gone through so many changes. Did a series manage to rule all others sales-wise? Is it the series you'd expect? Can you guess the highest-selling games of the past two decades? 


Fortunately, you don't have to think too hard about it. Consumer behavior advisory firm Circana, known for its in-depth research into video game data, released its findings of the top 20 best-selling games for the past decade. At the top of the list each year is more than a few surprises.

Final Fantasy. Kingdom Hearts. Mana. Dragon Quest. Chrono. Star Ocean. Valkyrie. Bravely. Square Enix has no shortage of RPG franchises under its belt, from those it's developed in-house to beloved classics that it's acquired over the years. But among all the space-faring action RPG and patisserie chef jobs, there’s one Square-developed franchise that manages to stand clear from the pack: SaGa.
SaGa made its mark on the world back in 1989 on the Game Boy, making it one of Square's longest-running franchises. It’s never gained the popularity of its older cousin, yet SaGa has accumulated a die-hard following over the years for its dedication to being weird and different. Non-linear stories, 'sparks' and 'glimmers,' multiple playable protagonists, and multiple timelines are all par for the course here.

I have fond memories of my Wii U, although sadly, it died a child’s drink spillage-related death a few years ago. It’s been a while since I picked one up, but I can still vividly remember playing on it for hours. Most of those hours were pumped into a select few games, so with that knowledge, here are my 10 favorite titles on the Wii U, in no particular order.

It's been a bit of a big week, and although we didn't get the 'Switch 2' reveal that many were perhaps hoping for, Nintendo did nevertheless launch a new 'Nintendo Music' mobile app and the Pokémon TCG Pocket mobile game. It also revealed the release date for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete along with a surprise Switch port of Xenoblade Chronicles X.

Kill Order is a brand-new 6v6 respawn mode introduced in Black Ops 6. Each team includes a High Value Target (HVT), a randomly selected player that must be eliminated for bonus scores. You must also guard your own HVT, as the other side will be gunning for them.

Nintendo has not always been the best at this sort of UX.


I listen to video game music quite a bit, and Nintendo has worked with some of the best composers in the industry. Most importantly, however, Nintendo hasn’t fallen into the trap of having all their game music sound like movie scoring.

There are dozens of Incantations in Hades 2, which can only be unlocked at the Crossroads Cauldron. Most Incantations are inaccessible until you pass some kind of prerequisite. You'll either have to meet or defeat a certain enemy, progress in a new Region/Location, become better friends with an ally, or find yourself in dire need of something. Some Incantations also come to Melinoë as if shared by a greater force. Regardless of how the spells appear, they're all incredibly useful in Melinoë's fight to defeat Chronos and free her family.

With that in mind, I’ve compiled a full list of choices that can be made in Double Exposure. While not all are life-altering, it’s worth paying attention to what you could have missed in each chapter. 


I’ve done my best to order the choices chronologically, so this list should guide you through the action as it happens so that you don’t miss out on anything. I’ve also noted which scene each choice appears in, so you can get back there and make a different choice through Chapter Select if you want to.

If you cast your mind back a couple of years, you might recall a rather heartwarming story about a guy who stumbled across an "abandoned" copy of Nintendogs on a late-night train home and set out trying to find the lost pups' owner. It was a sweet tale told in five parts by content creator and Nintendo Life reader Ben Riou-Pollard (@ben.m0v), and now, two years later, he's only gone and done it again.
Fear not, this isn't another story of dog abandonment, but it is one of abandoned Pokémon. You see, while hitting up a local car boot sale earlier this month, another lost game found its way into Ben's path: a battered old copy of Pokémon Emerald. And so, naturally, we're once again buying a ticket to another emotional rollercoaster of a TikTok series.

Although, since the game is largely unavailable aside from the free OpenTTD fan source port, it would be a feat in itself to purchase it.


This is a move that makes sense. Atari already licenses Roller Coaster Tycoon, and Chris Sawyer has kept a working relationship with the company, even back when they were terrible, and even after a 2005 lawsuit. Atari recently bought a large portion of Microprose’s back catalog and is resurrecting the brand as a publishing label. It would make sense that they’d want Transport Tycoon, and that Chris Sawyer would be willing to sell it to them.

This bizarre and unexpected, though not entirely unwelcome collaboration was announced at the very end of the 84th Live Letter on November 1, and it’s not the only strange choice for a collaboration that was revealed, but more on that later. 


Logos are a Japanese outdoor brand, but they do ship their products worldwide, meaning that the items included in this collaboration are available to all, for a price. Logos tents range in price from around $100 USD to around $3,000 USD, although the FFXIV-branded one is unlikely to reach those hefty sums. It looks to be a solo tent,…]]></summary>

Saving a princess has to be the most overused trope in the fantasy playbook. If pixelated plumbers and heroes clad in green tunics have taught us anything, it’s that princesses need rescuing – right? Not if Slay the Princess has anything to say about it. In this psychological horror visual novel, you're tasked with killing a princess to save the world – or so you’re told.
It starts with a straightforward premise: an unseen narrator calls on you to carry out a grisly murder for the greater good. But as you question the motives behind this task and mull whether to slay or spare the eponymous princess, the game reveals a surprisingly dense philosophical narrative that probes questions of perspective, autonomy, and existence.

Takaya Imamura, famed ex-Nintendo developer known for his work on the F-Zero and Star Fox franchises, has taken to social media to ponder the possibility of a Star Fox Zero release on Nintendo's upcoming 'Switch 2'.

I have nobody to impress most days but my cat, and the only item of clothing she appears to have an opinion on is my Oodie, which is very comfortable for both of us and also smells like a chicken shop, which I imagine is more pleasant for her than me.
This aside, I found myself taking a whole bunch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard screenshots as I played just to capture the RPG’s various outfits. They are ridiculous. Incredibly intricate and detailed, as well as being obscenely impractical for the most part. I do not like any of them in the sense I would wear them, but I like all of them in the sense that they display artists allowed to run free like caffeinated weasels and indulge their every whim.

Jim (that's me, hello!) and Alana joined our wonderful video producer, Felix, to talk all things Dragon Quest. The discussion covers a range of topics, from frustrating wild encounters to some of the catchiest music in recent memory, and you know there's going to be a good amount of gushing about the revamped visuals, too.

Inti Creates has announced that its retro action-adventure title Divine Dynamo Flamefrit will launch on the Nintendo Switch on 21st November 2024.
Originally revealed as an April Fools' joke that actually turned out to be real (okaaaay..?), Flamefrit sees you traverse a top-down world in which you battle enemies, solve puzzles, and cut grass in a way that would make Link green(er) with envy. Y'see, launching a fire attack against a tuft of grass will cause the rest of the field to immediately catch fire and burn to a crisp. It looks so darn satisfying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" series launch earlier this month there was launch-day benchmark review results for the EPYC 9575F, EPYC 9755, and EPYC 9965 processors in looking at that frequency optimized SKU, the new flagship 128-core Turin "classic" core model, and the new flagship 192-core Turin "dense" core SKU, respectively. That's interesting for looking at the new 5th Gen AMD EPYC top-end wares but in comparing to 4th Gen EPYC also means higher core counts at the top-end. In being curious about the core-for-core advantages of 5th Gen EPYC, I managed to get my hands on the AMD EPYC 9655 processors for seeing how that model compares to the prior AMD EPYC 9654 "Genoa" flagship model. Here's a look today at how the AMD EPYC 9655 1P/2P 96-core processor compares to the prior EPYC 9654 flagship.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konference OpenAlt 2024 proběhne již tento víkend 2. a 3. listopadu v prostorách FIT VUT v Brně. Začíná ale už v pátek na warm-up party ve Studentském klubu u Kachničky v 17:00. Pokud jste ještě areál FITu nenavštívili, k dispozici jsou pokyny k orientaci. 

Na programu je 54 přednášek a workshopů. Témata jsou od silně technických témat jako je třeba GCC nebo PostgreSQL po méně technické témata jako eGovernment, nebo třeba detailní analýzu problémů s Digitálním Stavebním Řízením. Vypíchnout lze přednášky linuxových distribucích Fedora Silverblue (Nerozbitný linux pro celou rodinu), openSUSE Leap, nebo Turris. Nesmí chybět témata jako kontejnery (Kubernetes) nebo umělá inteligence (velké jazykové modely). Už tradičně si můžete zkusit nakreslit mapu OpenStreetMap se zkušenými lektory od Missing Maps. Pro bastlíře je nachystaná například přednáška o chytré domácnosti Majordomus nebo o Linuxu v ledničce. S cílem přitáhnout mladší generaci představujeme studentskou sekci, kde jsou jednotlivé projekty dílem studentů (například v rámci jejich maturitních prací). Bude řeč i o výuce programování na základní škole, nebo výuce fyziky pomocí arduina "Physibox".

Mimo hlavní program bude na chodbách spoustu stánků různých projektů jako je Fedora, openSUSE, Grafana. Stánek budou mít i radio amatéři a 3D tiskaři. Pro děti bude v sobotu nachystaný dětský koutek, kde si děti budou moci vyzkoušet různé hračky pro výuku programování. V neděli se dětský koutek promění v PlayZone od OMG Robotics. Sobotní odpoledne tradičně zakončíme posezením u lahodného moku ve studentském klubu u Kachničky.

Budeme rádi, když myšlenky naší konference budete šířit a pozvete své kolegy a kamarády. Jak jistě víte, tak konference je primárně v češtině a vstup je zdarma.

Pokud máte nějaké otázky, tak se zkuste podívat do FAQ nebo se zeptejte na Matrixu, Telegramu nebo emailem.]]></summary>

Personally, it's not the vibe I'm after when I sit down in the evening and I think, "I would like to play a video game that makes me feel somewhat pleasant". But hey, it might be for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy RPG studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter Prey (2017) studio Arkane Austin - alongside a handful of others - back in May.
Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form Weird West studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for PC Gamer about Arkane’s closure, saying:
I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.

It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.

In the prologue, reformed outlaw John Marston confronts an old bandit acquaintance and gets himself roundly shot to bits. He’s rescued by local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane, who nurses him back to health and gives him a few odd jobs to warm him up for the next plot point.

Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am once again asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you Ian Games for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).

"Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: "Nazis? I hate these guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.
I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into "Adventure Points", used to "unlock" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets.

Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025.

As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Remains Of Edith Finch is a very upsetting collection of interactive short stories about the brief, tragic lives of a cursed family who live in a monstrous treehouse. It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.

Unfortunately for Bl6ps, and for us, that technical success is balanced on the knife tip of some seriously overwrought infrastructure. Mainly in the form the UX nightmare that is the Call of Duty HQ launcher, as well as a meddlesome always-online requirement, itself serving a feature that doesn’t even work that well.

But the word "ambivalent" already exists. So let's say I'm ambivalent about this new adventure featuring Max Caulfield, the returning hero of Life Is Strange, and time-travelling photographer whose powers have resurfaced after years of off-screen atrophy. I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've often thought lighthouse keeping would make a fine second career, albeit mostly because in my head, it would give me endless time to write (and finish Baldur's Gate 3). You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

Last Friday, as per a statement released by the VGHF and spotted by PC Gamer, the US Copyright Office officially denied the exemption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The precision-platformer is a torturous genre at the best of times, and now developers Brlka and publishers Ysbryd Games have seen fit to combine it with Silent Hill. Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".
When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.

The trick to selling this mindset is to overclock your obnoxious narcissism until it levels up into stylish solipsism. "It's news to me," I sternly insist, while announcing a game you might pedantically observe was announced in 2019. "I can obtain no reliable empirical evidence that this existed prior to my noticing it," I declare, writing about my discovery that Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 requires a permanent internet connection, even when you're playing the campaign.

Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget horror. I have been pigeonholed.

Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.
So, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn't only a product of its time - it's actually downright yucky.

If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project. Kaiju ambitious.

Depending on the direction of the wind, Moscow turns a blind eye or warns of a crackdown on pre-screening piracy, including one expected anytime now. In parallel, legal streaming platforms are enjoying huge growth as business booms.

This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Polish studio From Chaos consist of former members of Witcher developers CD Projekt Red, Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios and 4X household Paradox Interactive, led by erstwhile Gwent programmer Tomek Dietrich - so it's no huge surprise that their debut game, Liegecraft, is a big beardy historical strategy RPG.
It's a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Montpellier's Beyond Good And Evil 2 has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of "vapourware", while staunchly refusing to become "abandonware". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developers of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 have released an update to the third-person shooter that reverts a lot of tough difficulty changes made in a previous patch. Turns out upping the spawn rate of the vicious Tyrannid baddies across all difficulty modes was not welcome among the meathead murder boys of the Imperium. And this change wasn't the only one that caused enough ructions to justify hasty recalibrations from Saber Interactive.

All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs. It's also out now, which is good for people like me who crave bizzarovanias.

Graphics driver improvements! Third-party SSDs working better! More balanced display colours! No more "spurious power LED blinking"! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the Steam Deck OLED’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.

There’s also some interesting insight regarding design decisions, and the systems CA are hoping to tweak in the future. We’ll talk about that in a moment, but first, I must draw your attention to this magical map. I’m very excited about it. Not so much for what it does on its own - more for what its design philosophy represents and could mean for future additions.

Wilmot's Warehouse felt like that joke made manifest, putting you in the shoes of a tiny warehouse working squareboi. This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week or so, you may have caught wind of Denuvo  - the makers of anti-cheat and anti-piracy software  - embarking on a PR campaign of sorts, intended to combat negative public perception of their software. In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. 
Denuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. 
RPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered". What claims are you referring to?
Andreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.

Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel this one largely speaks for itself, honestly. I could theorise on the fictional conceit of bringing packaged creatures to life using a microwave and also, sometimes, a blender, but to do so would be to stare into a gift horse’s abyssal oat hole so intently that…
…I was going to finish that with something about its molars staring back, but I had to quickly Google “do horses have molars?” only to misspell it. “Yes, horses can have a strong sense of right and wrong, and what is fair,” went the AI overview. “Some say that horses can teach people to live in the present and to be authentic.”
Thanks for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was little, I really liked what I saw of Shin chan, even if it was just largely flashes of his bare arse on Japanese TV. He seemed mischievous, a bit of a menace, and part of a fun family dynamic. Flash forward to now and I can only describe the lad as… jarring. At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.
And I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.

This revelation came from Woolen's Instagram story, where he shared an image clearly displaying the site's URL. While Woolen seemed unconcerned when the news reached him, the NFL, which actively combats piracy, will likely take a different view.

Your objective is, indeed, to build the sun, because there isn't one: the game's pastoral pixelart world is engulfed in darkness.

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.
It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.
"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game," developer Raphael Bossniak admits.
And yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.

Original story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: "{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, we learned that Star Citizen studio Cloud Imperium Games were mandating overtime for employees in the lead-up to their fan convention, Citizencon, which was held this past weekend. Additionally, this TOIL (time off in lieu) wouldn’t be made available until the release of space game Star Citizen’s accompanying single player campaign, Squadron 42.
At CitizenCon over the weekend, CIG head promiser Chris Roberts said that he’s “confident” that Sqorty-two will release in 2026, via Ian Games. CIG also released a video of the entire first hour and fifteen of the game, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy this week, everybody! In my efforts to achieve the absolute tranquility needed to spend five days shovelling PC game news stories into a ravenous otherworldly monster, I often go for an early morning walk. I tend to do this while wearing my trusty, enveloping Honcho Poncho, because the UK summer is thoroughly behind us and the very air has begun to squelch. Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour! I'll wear that nice top hat and opera mask from my socialite days in future. Anyway, let us FEED THE MAW.

The subsequent nationwide blackout, affecting millions of Italians, wasn't just a hapless IP address blunder. This was the reckless blocking of a Google.com subdomain that many 10-year-olds could identify as being important. Reckless people and internet infrastructure, what could possibly go wrong next?

To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z "Návratu do budoucnosti" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas).
