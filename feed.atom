Over the holidays we're republishing some choice features from the last 12 months. A mix of talking points, interviews, opinion pieces and more from NL staff and contributors, you'll find our usual blend of thoughtfulness, expertise, frivolity, retro nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Happy holidays!

As you've probably noticed, GoldenEye 007 is now 25 years old and can legally hire a car in a foreign country. The influence of Rare's seminal shooter on the FPS genre and console video gaming in general is enormous, and gamers have now been poring over it and picking apart its secrets for the last two-and-a-half decades. It stands as a monolith in the gaming landscape, an artifact that's spawned endless investigation, discussion, and debate. What is there left to say?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The biggest takeaway? Quaxly lost
As has been their custom for a while now, Japanese site GameWith ran a massive poll to see what people's favorite Generation 9 (Scarlet & Violet) Pokemon were, and the results were both predictable in some cases, and shocking in others. Let's break it down.
Tinkaton wins big, and Quaxly loses massively
Voting took place from December 16, 2022 through December 23, 2022, and had a total of 177,829 participants. For those of you who are interested, here's a brief overview of the top 10:
Tinkaton
Clodsire
Sprigatito
Fuecoco
Ceruledge
Tatsugiri
Sylveon
Slither Wing
Lucario
Gardevoir
If I had to bet money on it before the fact, I would have predicted Tinkaton in the top 10, especially given the design, type, and overall strength of the newcomer. Seeing a form of Sprigatito and Fuecoco in the mix (the top five no less) makes a lot of sense too. But suspiciously absent from the top 10 (nay, the top 30 entirely) is Quaxly. Many spot polls showed the water starter lagging behind the other two, but this is just something else.
Many other picks are logical. Lucario is still a standout Pokemon and has many many appearances in other media/spinoffs. Sylveon continues to be one of the more popular Eeveelutions, and given its penchant for Tera Raid power, it's a no-brainer in Generation 9. Many folks were also really high on Slither Wing from the jump, and Gardevoir maintaining its popularity was a given.
Going further beyond the top 10, Koraidon (Scarlet) has beaten Miraidon (Violet) as the most popular box legendary, and multiple Eeveelutions made the list, as did Charizard, who is only available via 7-Star Raids. You can find the entire list below!
Here are the most popular Scarlet & Violet Pokemon poll results:

Pokémon Unite continues to bring in new 'mons into its roster, and the last addition in 2022 is none other than Dragapult, the Dragon/Ghost-type from Pokémon Sword & Shield!
Dragapult is a new Ranged Attacker who can use the move 'Dreep and Destroy' to fire two little Dreepy at its opponent. We've always thought that's a little cruel, but they seem to enjoy it (we used it a lot in Sword & Shield). But the attack blast also damages nearby enemies. It can also use Dragon Breath, Dragon Dance, and Phantom Force.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You should uh, probably grab it
Dishonored - Definitive Edition is live on the Epic Games Store, and is arguably the last big 2022 freebie on the marketplace.
The "kill or not to kill" stealth/action game was originally released in 2012 from Arkane Studios, where it rose to fame very quickly, and helped put Arkane on the map. Shortly after, it hosted some DLC in the form of the Dunwall City Trials (challenge maps), and two story campaigns (Knife of Dunwall, The Brigmore Witches). All of that is included in said Definitive Edition (on top of the Void Walker's Arsenal bonus), which is a pretty great deal: especially given that I liked some elements of the DLC more than the main game. I'd consider this a pretty good New Year's present, and it's definitely worth playing through if you have a rainy holiday weekend coming up.
The promotion went live this morning, and will run through January 5, 2023 at 11:00AM ET. At the moment, Eximius: Seize the Frontline is also available until that exact time, at which point Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics: Aiko's Choice will be cycled in. Those will be available until January 12, 2023. 
You can find Dishonored - Definitive Edition on the Epic Games Store here.

Sports Story got a sudden eShop release this week amid some teases: and really, that's about it! Sports Story is the only featured game this week as far as Nintendo is concerened, but there are a few other offerings to close out the year. Vampire Slayer: The Resurrection (based on a Half-Life mod) is of note, as is the release of Toy Soldiers HD on Switch: which has been a long time coming.
Really though, this is an opportunity to reflect on 2022, and move into 2023 with some lessons learned. Well, maybe not as far as publishers go: they'll keep pushing the limits of what is acceptable in the industry until someone tells them no. So I guess we have that constant to look forward to. Happy New Year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the year’s biggest open-world games, Elden Ring and Pokémon Scarlet have been Frankensteined into one tantalizing entity thanks to the work of one talented modder.
The modder in question goes by the handle Arestame, who tweeted a trailer of their handiwork that drops Scarlet assets into the Lands Between. The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

It’s unclear if this mod will be publicly available to download or if this video is only a proof-of-concept showcase. We’ve reached out to Arestame for clarification and will update this story if we receive a response.

There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. 
No word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three.

However, the big story is that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has surpassed five million physical sales in Japan. That means the game has sold just under one million units a year. And it's still a mainstay in the weekly charts, so those numbers will just keep going up. However, you'll notice that Pokémon is hot on its heels already with over 4.3 million physical copies sold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the end of the road.
It’s only taken 11 games to figure it out, but publisher Nacon has finally realised that numbering its WRC games has perhaps started to get a little ridiculous. As such, this sequel to WRC 10 has ditched the numbering system, and goes by the more approachable title of WRC Generations. It’s an interesting time to finally make the change, however, because this is the last game in the WRC series as it stands before EA and Codemasters take over the wheel from KT Racing.
The WRC games have something of a reputation on Switch for not quite delivering optimal performance, and for the most part that’s the case here too. Generations looks ever so slightly better than WRC 10, but that doesn’t mean we’re now looking at Forza or anything like that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sequels are often contentious, but I feel like video games can get away with being a part of a long-running series – and, crucially, still be good while they’re at it, well past the point where a book or movie franchise would have outstayed its welcome.
The thing is, though, when it comes to GOTY lists like our Advent Calendar, it’s a much bigger task to convince your fellow voters of the merits of your new favourite game when it’s the third, fourth, or maybe even sixteenth in its series. I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.

When Nintendo and Game Freak announced that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet would feature the franchise's first fully open world, fans understandably had many questions: just how open are we talking? See that mountain? Can I go to it?
The finished article undoubtedly delivered on Nintendo's promise, even if it demonstrated a few rough edges in the process. The world of Paldea was truly your oyster, and for the first time in Pokémon's 25 year history, you could go wherever you wanted right from the start, skill level be damned.

Over the holidays we're republishing some choice features from the last 12 months. A mix of talking points, interviews, opinion pieces and more from NL staff and contributors, you'll find our usual blend of thoughtfulness, expertise, frivolity, retro nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Happy holidays!

If you're into anime, then chances are you can remember the first movie or TV show that got you hooked on the medium; your "gateway drug", if you will. For some, it might be TV shows like DragonBall Z or One Piece, others perhaps a specific movie like Ghost in the Shell or Akira (indeed, I had to really go back through the memory archives to determine whether Akira was the first one for me; it was definitely incredibly early in my life). For me, however, the very earliest memory I have of watching anime was the incredible video game adaptation, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, released in 1994.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get Very Metal this winter
Epic Games Store is continuing its rollout of free video games for each and every day of the holidays, today's offering — still available for a few more hours — is dark action RPG Mortal Shell, which all users can download direct from the EGS dashboard.
Developed by Cold Symmetry and launched on PC and console platforms in 2020, Mortal Shell is fantasy adventure that takes extreme pride in its highly challenging, melee-focused combat. Inspired by the much-loved Dark Souls franchise, the development team set out to make a similarly toned adventure where every single swing of the blade mattered, where life and death rest on the edge of one right (or wrong) decision in the heat of battle, and where swift adaptation to each enemy is the key to victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSs0_PBGiLs&ab_channel=PlayStation
In Mortal Shell, players can inhabit the bodies (or "mortal shells") of the deceased, gaining access to their skills, weapons, and abilities. As such, the combat in the game has a natural evolution, as the player passes from body to body, learning new skills on the fly and adapting to the reconfiguration of their offensive and defensive maneuvers. Mortal Shell received plaudits on release for its smart combat and compelling challenge, with many noting that its unabashed love of the FromSoftware titles was readily apparent, with some reviewers noting that it felt like playing Dark Souls for the first time all over again.
Mortal Shell is available to download for free from Epic Games Store. It is also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new NieR adaptation is right around the corner
NieR fans won't have to wait too long into the new year for its anime adaptation to kick off. The NieR: Automata anime has locked in a premiere date for January 7, 2023 in Japan.
A few trailers have been dropping over the holidays for the upcoming anime adaptation of 2017's NieR: Automata. The first features 2B and 9S fairly prominently, as two leads we'll be following in the Ver. 1.1a anime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGpskkA7vrw
Another new trailer today shows off some of the supporting cast, as well as the opening and ending tracks for the series. Both trailers have a January 7 premiere date set for the adaptation. We already knew it was arriving sometime in January, but it looks like the date is much sooner in the month than one might have expected.
Most of the adaptation is covering some familiar territory, given what we see in the trailers. There is one character, Lily, who appears in the lore but seems to be playing a larger role in the anime. It'll be interesting to see how much this Ver 1.1a diverges from the game.
Become as gods
The series looks set to air on Crunchyroll as well as other platforms, though exact distribution plans and dates aren't clear just yet. We'll have to see just what the global rollout looks like as the series goes live.
NieR: Automata isn't the only video game adaptation kicking off in January 2023, either. HBO's The Last of Us is set to debut not too long after on January 15, 2023. And the animated Dragon Age: Absolution just recently went live on Netflix, too. It's quite the time for video game adaptations, and there's even more on the way. Hopefully they can turn out as well as shows like Arcane and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have.

The new year is almost upon us, and with it a new month of PlayStation Plus titles. Sony has revealed the three games headed to PlayStation Plus to kick off January 2023, including a good way to brush up ahead of a big 2023 release.
Headlining the January 2023 PS Plus offering is Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the single-player action-adventure game from Respawn following runaway Jedi Cal Kestis. It's a good grab for anyone who needs to catch up on the story, as its sequel Jedi: Survivor is due to arrive in March. It's not a large window, but Fallen Order should be easy to blast through in that amount of time.
For a little more multiplayer, Fallout 76 heads onto PS4. Though there's been an ongoing tussle over the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard acquisition, Bethesda's multiplayer Fallout will be free to grab for PlayStation Plus users in the month of January 2023.
Closing out the month is Axiom Verge 2, the follow-up to the first Axiom Verge. While it takes a more action-platforming approach with fewer guns and more exploration, it's still a solid experience worth checking out if you enjoy exploring a map and ticking off squares.

A new year of Plus
While those three games head to every category under PlayStation's tiered Plus system, more is on the way for those at the higher tiers. The PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium lineup for January is set to be announced soon.
These PlayStation Plus games, meanwhile, go live on January 3, 2023. And if you haven't yet, there's still time to add Mass Effect: Legendary Edition and the other December PlayStation Plus games to your library before they go away.

The horizons of my video game tastes have broadened pretty significantly over the past few years, but my undying love for narrative games first and foremost has never wavered. While 2022 has been a great year for games in general, from heavy hitters like Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok to indie darlings like Cult of the Lamb and Vampire Survivors, I think this past year has been one of the best we've seen for narrative games in a good while due to the breadth of stories that were told both thematically and mechanically.
Whether those stories were rooted in lighthearted, optimistic sentimentality or a grounded, gritty introspection, I was reminded time and time again why I'm so excited for games to continue paving the way forward as our youngest and most dyna…]]></summary>

You might already be familiar with one, and that's Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-inspired character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn't go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

Veteran publisher Taito, in conjunction with developer M2, has released a teaser trailer for its upcoming shmup compilation Ray'z Arcade Chronology. The classic shmup series take to the stars once again when it launches in Japan on PS4 and Nintendo Switch in March 2023.
As we have previously reported, Ray’z Arcade Chronology compiles the three original titles from the franchise — namely RayForce (1994), RayStorm (1996) and RayCrisis (1998) — with a newly revamped edition of the 2013 remaster RayStorm HD, complete with brand new features including a classic 4:3 screen ratio and the original arcade dipswitch settings. The compendium is then rounded out with a brand new remaster of RayCrisis, titled RayCrisis HD, specifically developed for this new release.
Ray’z Arcade Chronology will launch in Japan March 9, 2023, on PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Western fans of the pew-pew persuasion need not fret, as publisher ININ Games has already confirmed that it will be localizing the collection for western release, although a specific launch date is yet to be announced.

I love dark winter nights. If it's below freezing with snow piled on the window sills and wind whipping through frozen tree branches, then even better. I definitely don't want to be out in those conditions, but late December evenings are the perfect backdrop to some of my favorite winter traditions. I've abandoned a lot of those tinsel-covered activities and replaced them with things that I like more.
While my list continues to grow, it currently includes playing Nick Offerman's "Yule Log", gifting new clothes to loved ones to protect them from the Yule Cat, and reading ghost stories on Christmas Eve. I've adopted these things over the years from my hobbies and from the stories people tell me. Now they bring me joy when I need joy the most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...]]></summary>

The Guilty Gear franchise is renowned for its bizarre arsenal of stylish weaponry, from Faust's 10-foot scalpel to Ino's satanic shredder, but perhaps one of the most ingenious tools belongs to the delightful young bounty hunter Bridget, in the form of her trick-shot-tastic Bullet Yo-Yo.
And, if you fancy taking an eye or two out yourself, then hobby crafter SpinGear has you covered, as the Japanese yo-yo specialist is now taking pre-orders on an exceptionally cool-looking replica of Bridget's weapon of choice. The "Full Metal Bridget Mini Yo-Yo" is an authentic (if smaller) replica of our girl's face-flicker, faithfully recreating the six-shooter style of its casing and cast in solid metal.
Check out the ace toy/death dealer in action in this official video, complete with Bridget cosplay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3ql62Lot7E
So if you fancy picking one up, hurting yourself, and realizing you're just as terrible with the yo-yo now as you were with that Coca-Cola one in 1991, then head on over to the official YOYOSHOP SPINGEAR website, where you can pre-order the Full Metal Bridget Yo-Yo for ¥44,000 or... erm... $330 USD... Well, if that seems a little on the pricey side for you, then a far simpler design is also expected in January, priced at a somewhat cheaper ¥4,400, or $32.
"We understand pre-order expensive yoyo feels little scary." explains the website. Yer-darn-tootin'. But, hey, you can't put a price on knocking mum's favorite vase off the mantle.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port arrives spring 2023.
Oh, and don't forget to check out our previous report on this cute Bridget fan animation.

It wasn't an easy task, to be honest. Sure, this year saw the delay of multiple big-name projects into 2023. I'm a bit grateful for that though, as it at least gave me time to spend on some smaller indie releases. And wow, did they come out swinging.

Early in 2022, we put out a list of 14 games we'd love to have on Switch. Since then, we've got at least five of them on Switch, so we're either prescient or powerful. So, in hopes that 2023 will be similarly rewarding, we're aiming this feature at you, Doug Bowser — we'd love to see the following games ported onto Nintendo's hybrid console. You don't even have to credit us, we're just that nice.

After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.
Elden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind. I stopped eating Red Lobster because it caused me to suffer terrible flashbacks of getting relentless…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the new year, Sony has revealed the next batch of free games coming to PlayStation Plus. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 will be available to download for all tiers of PS Plus starting Tuesday, January 3. PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they'll be "announced soon." You can read the full blog post here.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.
This is also a friendly reminder to claim December's PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. They'll all be available until January 3, the day the new games are added, so be sure to grab them before that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Case proceeding against Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator
Former Sega veteran Yuji Naka has been formally indicted following their arrest earlier this month for suspected insider trading. The indictment was reported yesterday by Japan's NHK news corporation.
Naka was first arrested in November as part of an investigation into insider trading at studio Square Enix, led by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors’ Office Investigation Department. Naka, along with two further SE employees named as Taisuke Sazaki and Fumiaki Suzuki, was arrested under suspicion of purchasing stock in Japanese studio Aiming, right before Square announced that the developer was working on a new title in the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quest: Tact.
At the start of December, Naka was re-arrested after the investigation uncovered further evidence suggesting that the Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator had purchased 120,000 shares in developer ATeam ahead of the announcement that said studio would be producing mobile release Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. The shares in question were valued at around ¥144.7 million yen ($834,000 USD).
"We have been fully cooperating with requests from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission," said Square Enix in a statement published in November. “As the investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is underway, we will continue to fully cooperate with their investigation."
"We deeply regret the great concern this has caused to all concerned. We have dealt with this incident strictly, including internal disciplinary actions taken against the suspected employees."
It is currently not known when or if Naka will stand trial for these charges. Yuji Naka left Square Enix in 2021, following the critical and commercial failure Balan Wonderworld. Naka would later file suit against Square Enix, arguing that they had removed him from development six months ahead of release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking back over an entire year of RPS reviews and, well, we've written a lot. Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.
Out of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 22, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!

As the year's end shuffles into view, number-crunching firms are taking a look back at the last 12 months to recognize patterns, facts, and figures as they pertain to gaming, retail, prices, sales, and player behavior — And a new report from the statisticians at NewZoo offers up some interesting reading.
NewZoo places its estimate for the global games market value at a staggering $184.4 billion USD. This accounts for almost game sales, on PC, console, and mobile platforms. It should also be noted that this already impressive figure does not take into account Nintendo game sales, as the publisher has always been weirdly prudish when it comes to revealing its own bottom line.

Of this total market value, $51.8 billion manifested through console games, with a further $38.2 billion pulled in by downloaded/boxed PC titles, and $2.3 billion from browser-based PC games. Of course, mobile gaming takes the lion's share, with a massive $92.2 billion in total revenue. This sector was led by the continued dominance of titles such as TiMi Studios' Honor of Kings, and PUBG Corporation's PUBG Mobile, which continue to earn billions year-on-year from the global market.
When it comes specifically to console gaming, around 72% of all game sales were digital downloads, with only the remained 28% accounting for physical releases. This continues a trend we have witnessed for many years now, with each consecutive year seeing more and more customers opting for digital game purchases over boxed copies. Again, this figure does not include Nintendo Switch software, which represents perhaps the last real bastion of high-street retail gaming purchases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zuh?
The jury is out on pretty much every detail regarding Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but we might have another piece of the puzzle if this ad is legit. Reddit user Few_Working3350 has apparently located an ad, which showcases some form of Nintendo Switch Online functionality for the game.
The ad seems to be Dutch in origin, with the standard marketing phrase "Haal meer uit je Nintendo Switch," which roughly translates to "get more out of your Nintendo Switch!" The ad then highlights some form of Switch Online functionality, with a big banner. If true, it could be anything; possibly even some form of asynchronous mechanic similar to the Souls series. It could also be an erroneous local ad that explains that you can connect online and download future DLC. We've reached out to Nintendo for clarification on the matter.

We're still half a year away from Tears of the Kingdom
The next big entry in the Zelda franchise is due out on May 13, 2023, and you can bet we'll be seeing some showcases for it: maybe as early as this January.
Nintendo has a lot of confidence going into this release given all the good will they've generated from Breath of the Wild, so this seems like it'll be a pretty easy slam dunk. I mean, if they rework weapon durability and add real dungeons, this game will potentially soar even higher.

Nintendo has shared its annual Switch eShop sales rankings for Japan earlier today, and if you've been keeping an eye on the news over the last 12 months, then there will be no surprises here. Splatoon 3 is 2022's best-selling game on the eShop, which shouldn't be a shock given that it broke records in both physical and digital sales when it first launched.
Right behind Splatoon is January's Pokémon Legends: Arceus, with Pokémon Violet taking the third spot (Scarlet is in fourth as both games are counted separately). Monster Hunter Rise, last year's number one, rounds out the top five, likely thanks to Sunbreak's launch over the summer. These rankings are based on sales on the eShop between January 1, 2022 and December 20, 2022.

In a world of annual releases and mandated sequels, The Punchuin, the latest release from Shin'en (Fast RMX, The Touryst), feels like a real passion project. It's a charming love letter to puzzle game fans with an incredible amount of heart put into it. But despite that, once you start peeling back the layers, you’re left with a great core gameplay loop that is too lacking in content to feel like a finished project.
In The Punchuin, you take direct control of a penguin who is quite fond of punching and sets out to look for the treasure hidden in the depths of Punch Mountain. With the help of a giant sentient boxing glove, you tackle multiple challenges to collect diamonds from each level in order to pass the various gates blocking your path further down. The plot, while simple, serves its purpose quite well, and is helped tremendously by the wonderfully endearing and witty dialogue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But move swiftly and efficiently if you want it
As Epic Games Store continues its holiday tradition of offering up a free game every day, today give sits users the opportunity to bag the high-speed, stunt-mechanic action-fest Severed Steel, which is available to claim for the next few hours directly from the EGS dashboard.
Developed by Chicago-based Greylock Studio and released in the spring of last year, Severed Steel is a first-person shooter of the speed 'n' style vernacular. That is to say, it occupies the same territory as games such as High Hell, Ghostrunner, and SuperHOT where the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of the player's movement are equally as important as simply staying alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr9olh1yqk&ab_channel=Digerati
Set in a future-noir world, players control the vengeance-fuelled protagonist Steel, who has lost an arm to an accident manufactured by the omnipotent corporation EdenSys. Outfitted with an energy cannon to replace the missing limb, Steel sets out on a one-woman-vendetta against EdenSys, eradicating its operations and liberating those crushed beneath its metal heels. This translates to a slickly designed, hugely destructible environments and highly stylized and explosive FPS action, all backed by a fantastic, adrenaline-pumping score.
So If you fancy ringing a few ears as you ring in the new year, then head on over to Epic Games Store right now and bag Severed Steel gratis, you have just a few more hours before it will be replaced by the next offering. Severed Steel is also available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most titles have now been fixed.
A severe vulnerability affecting several Nintendo consoles was found recently, with the potential to allow unauthorised access to Switch, 3DS, and Wii U via a host of online games. It's reported that for some time Nintendo has been working to patch games to eliminate the exploit known as 'ENLBufferPwn', with several updates already live to address the situation (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
The vulnerability, which has been categorised as 'Critical' on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and detailed in full on GitHub by PabloMK7, Rambo6Glaz, and Fishguy6564, reportedly exposes a victim's device to complete remote control by simply playing an online game with a potential attacker. This means that attackers may gain access to sensitive information or take audio and video recordings by remotely executing code.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

The latest UK boxed charts are in and there is very little change in the wind this week, with FIFA 23, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and God of War Ragnarok all leading the market once again.
The only major change of note is the fresh inclusion of both Sonic Frontiers and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope in the top ten, thanks to both titles being reduced in retail to prices hovering around the £30 mark. With Sonic Frontiers specifically, the Nintendo Switch version once again sold the most, accounting for 44% of the sales split across all available platforms.

With more than 1,000 Pokémon in existence nowadays, it's probably hard for a lot of trainers to narrow down a list of their favourites. Japan made it a little bit easier recently with a poll exclusively focused on the new releases Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
In the top 10, there were old favourites like Lucario and Sylveon mixed in with some ninth-generation pocket monsters. In third was Meowscarada - the evolution of the new grass starter, in second place was Clodsire - evolving from the Paldea Wooper, and in first was the best girl, Tinkaton (see above).

Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...]]></summary>

In this case, a fast USB-C flash drive can be just the thing, with the newfangled connection allowing use on a wide range of devices like phones, tablets and games consoles too. Case in point is Samsung's 128GB model, which is reduced to £12 today from its usual price of £20.

I have always had a bit of trouble playing older games.
This might not come as a surprise to some discerning Destructoid readers, who have, in the past, derided me for the recency bias seemingly on display in a handful of my ranked lists. It's true — I do tend to play more new releases than older ones, and I tend to enjoy them more, as well. Call it an occupational hazard (it's easier to write about new games when you're playing them on release), chalk it up to my age (I am, as you might imagine, younger than many readers), but the fact stands: I prefer more modern titles.

Of course, this isn't a moral failing, but it is a bit of a problem. See, I am the kind of person who takes a great interest in figuring out why things are the way they are. Anthropologically, I'm fascin…]]></summary>

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.

The vast, open world of Paldea is open for exploring. And if fast travel is too slow for you, then this latest Pokemon Scarlet and Violet glitch may be more your speed.
Players have been utilizing a trick that essentially turns your legendary, either Koraidon or Miraidon, into a fighter jet. This speed glitch started gaining popularity recently thanks to Twitter user @yuudainano, though they note that others discovered it before their post gained traction.
Essentially, the idea is to dash and leap off a high point in Pokemon Scarlet / Violet. (I recommend the highest peak in Paldea, up in the snowy mountains.) Deploy the glider, then cut it and turn, then redeploy and whip Miraidon or Koraidon back around in the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...]]></summary>

You know those "year in review" tools, and how they're all called something different? Well Steam just unleashed theirs out into the world, and it's going to be a doozy for most Steam users: since, you know, there's probably a lot of games lingering on your Steam accounts.
The "Steam Replay" feature showcases several aspects of your 2022 gaming habits:
Highlights of your most-played games/genres and how many games you played
Your percentage of keyboard + mouse use compared to a controller
How many achievements you unlocked
A full breakdown of your most-played games (with graphs!)
How you compare to the Steam average in terms of games played, achievements unlocked, and play streaks
The comparison data is interesting, as the average amount of achievements unlocked per Steam player in 2022 is 21, the average amount of games played was five, and the longest streak is nine days.

How to access your Steam Replay recap:
You can find it right here at this link.
Or, you can locate it in the Steam app itself.
There are a few provisos to keep in mind for your 2022 Steam Replay chart:
"Steam Replay 2022 includes all of your play time between the first second of January 1 and the last second of December 14"
"Steam Replay does not include any playtime played in offline mode or when disconnected from internet"
"Steam Replay excludes time spent running tools and other types of non-game software. It also excludes games that are unreleased or disabled."

The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. 
The full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen.

Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.
With Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, "Space Applebee's"
Waking up in the morning to the phrase "help I'm stuck in an Applebee's" would normally be a terrifying prospect: but since it's taking place in-game in High on Life, it's a little less serious.
As pointed out by PCGamesN, some High on Life players seem to be having issues getting stuck in the Space Applebee's location: one of the many absurd parodies the game offers. Normally you're supposed to go inside the Applebee's as part of the critical path storyline (which is normally closed/locked), then leave (with the option to pay your check). But some folks on Steam are reporting that they cannot exit the space, and are doomed to an eternity of eating digital jalapeno poppers and potato skins.
Here's a great recap of one person's predicament:
"I had just paid the bill in applebees and rescued a human in a cage outside of the store in the slums. i jumped into the portal where the humans go and was jetpacking up the ledges above them when i was teleported into applebees with all closed doors and no way out. i have reloaded save, stuck in applebys [sic] still. Reinstalled, same deal any way to get out of here??"

Not once did I expect to write anything remotely like this in 2022, especially since my nearest Applebee's is abandoned.
This is one of many technical issues with High on Life
Jokes aside, I ran into many technical oddities in High on Life, both before the day one patch during the review period, and after. It really helps that it's a Game Pass game, because spending $60 on this and having it glitch this badly for some folks wouldn't be great! Hopefully there's a patch on the way for the Applebee's fiasco.

I joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites! It's even harder to celebrate my own achievements, but that's beside the point.

It might be the holidays, but there is still money to made, and as such the battle between Microsoft and various global regulators — butting heads over the former's $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard — rages on, becoming more complex as the parties draw lines around the proposed merger.
Microsoft has filed its official response to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the regulators that are currently holding the sale to scrutiny as part of its antitrust investigations. Microsoft's statement displays frustration with ongoing accusations that the purchase would create a monopoly over the market, while reiterating that the publisher has no desire to withhold golden goose franchise Call of Duty from other gaming platforms.

I’d probably also tip a hat to Warhammer 40K: Darktide, but Alice0 already nabbed it for her honourable mentions, and frankly there’s enough shootybang stuff here as it is. But, also: toilet build quality testing, pushing Nazis into cement pits, and more than a hint of 70s funk. Check ‘em out.

Released on PlayStation and PC in the fall of 2021, before being ported to the Switch earlier this year, F.I.S.T. is an anthropomorphic adventure set against the backdrop of a miserable and repressed cityscape, battered and bruised by the hand of an omnipresent corporation known as "Legion". The working class civilians and fallen soldiers of war do what they can to keep their heads down and eik out a meager existence beneath the polluted skies and clanking machinery that rules with a literal iron fist.

You might already be familiar with one, and that's Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-esque character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn't go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan was great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Dani, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Ryan here).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though it’s a remake of a game released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us Part I is, in most respects, the same game as the original The Last of Us. Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.
But even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right. By making a game look “better” than it did before, it’s changed into something else. Whether in small or large ways, it is altered. Read more...]]></summary>

I reviewed a lot of games this year. More than 50. Then in between those games, I managed to cram in a bunch more extra-curricular titles and maybe something that qualifies as a life for a maladjusted introvert like myself. That’s probably why this year feels like it lasted forever and was a ceaseless cavalcade of failures. My brain is full.
So, allow me to spill my brain all over the page here, as I recount the games that left the most lasting scars in 2022. Fortunately, this also doubles as a list of developers who should be paying for the therapy that keeps me going as a borderline functional member of society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier: Automata is coming to the small screen. Beginning next month, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in the United States on Crunchyroll.
You can check out a brand-new trailer for the show below: 


From the looks of it, Ver1.1a will stick close to the storyline from the video game, released in 2017 as a partnership between publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games. Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. 
The series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023. As of right now, it's not entirely clear what day it will hit Crunchyroll. However, the streaming service does often have the right to begin showing anime in the west within 24 hours of their original airtimes, so time will tell if Nier gets the same treatment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, "Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like "Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).
Because we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!

Do you own a jar of my toenail clippings? Not many people do. They’re a scarce commodity, but scarcity is a daft reason to own anything. It’s hardwired into our brain that if there are few of something, we want it more. We know it as the “fear of missing out,” and it’s one of the most annoying subsets of greed.
Video game collecting is a pretty innocuous embodiment of this. To my knowledge, no wars have been fought over a copy of Snatcher on the Sega CD. However, it’s still rather annoying. I collect games because they are a tangible representation of the game. I like to play them. Don’t give me a factory-sealed game, because I will open it. I don’t want to look down on anyone else’s reasoning for why they collect games, but I can’t help but find it ridiculous that some …]]></summary>

The card is much stronger pound for pound than its closest Nvidia competition, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070, with the latter remaining at surprisingly high prices due to the ultrapremium RTX 4080 and 4090 Team Green has launched so far. 
Today, the best price we've spotted for the RX 6700 XT is for a Gigabyte Eagle model, selling on Amazon UK for £389.99. That's nearly 40% below its RRP and an overall great value for this level of performance.

2022 was an exhausting year, and we could use a bit of respite before we head into the great unknown of 2023. As is our yearly tradition, we figured we'd check in with the community and see how everyone's Christmas is going.
As for me, friends of the family picked us up the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ornament from Hallmark, which is going next to our Minecraft one. My wife grabbed me an accompanying Raccoon Mario ornament, as well as a few goodies for my ever-growing tabletop collection. The little bands on the bottom of the header image are for keeping open board game boxes shut, and the case at the top is a Quiver: for holding game cards. I gifted myself a red DualSense PS5 controller earlier this week on sale, since we could use a third one for our kid.
I've been playing a lot of Marvel Champions, Arkham Horror: The Card Game, and Lord of the Rings: The Card game this year, so both of those accessories will come in handy. Video game-wise we've been playing a lot of couples games lately, including the recently-released Escape Academy DLC, as well as Operation Tango.
There's a lot of opportunities to clean up on some video game-related gifts this year, but the tabletop industry is adjacent enough to share if you want! Merry Christmas Destructoid!

It may be the holidays, but that isn't going to stop the retro purveyors over at Hamster from keeping the ball rolling on its Arcade Archives ranger — Joining the huge range of shumps rereleased by the publisher on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's Namco's unique chopper blaster, Metal Hawk.
Hitting the arcade market in 1988, Metal Hawk initially looks like standard, vertically-scrolling blaster, which were a dime a dozen in the genre's late-'80s boom period. However, Metal Hawk has a few cool features that helped it stand out from its contemporaries.

Good morning, good weekend, happy holidays, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing?

I must admit to not feeling particularly "Christmassy" in 2022, and I haven't in some years. But, importantly, I never lose the love for life slowing down just a little, and delivering us all a little bit of holiday cheer, with the emphasis on "Holiday".
So, I hope that this week has been kind to you and yours, and that this weekend will allow you to take your foot off the accelerator a little — regardless of whether you're celebrating Santa Day or otherwise. I'm really grateful that you took a little time out to join us this morn…]]></summary>

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? 
I traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that's been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer. 
Simply put, Los Angeles has become an island, metaphorically speaking.

His will be different, he says, because he's "taking the approach of changing and evolving the world of Death Stranding in a way that suits film well".
He also says there's "no real need" to turn games into films, which is a true and enjoyable acknowledgement from someone who is doing that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports Story is available now, Nintendo and developer SideBar Games announced during a special Inside the House of Indies holiday video. The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.
Golf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. 
You can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.


Golf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it "a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics," awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.
Sports Story is available now for Switch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gran Turismo series has long been a favorite of sim-racing enthusiasts, and today marks a special milestone for the franchise. Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator was released on PlayStation in Japan on December 23, 1997, meaning that the series has officially crossed the quarter-century mark. To celebrate 25 years of Gran Turismo, PlayStation released a special blog post and a retrospective video.
The blog post comes by way of Kazunori Yamauchi, creator and producer of the franchise and CEO of Polyphony Digital. In the post, Yamauchi recounts how the series came to be, with his original plans for the series stretching as far back as 1992.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a playable teaser released to promote Life Is Strange 2, the first episode of which followed on three months after this surprise p.t. dropped during E3 2018. Not to be confused with Silent Hills P.T. (it's like… the exact opposite of that), Captain Spirit is free to play, takes two to three hours to complete, and manages to perfectly encapsulate the Life Is Strange experience without giving anything away about the main (read: paid-for) games in the series. It also features possibly my favourite LIS protagonist in adorable wannabe superhero Chris, which is quite a high bar to clear, considering how much time I spend banging on about what great characters Chloe and Sean are.

Brothers Tarn and Zach Adams have spent the past 16 years relying on donations, so actually selling their game has now allowed to expand their team and hire someone from their community to help with the programming. They say "Putnam" will be the first non-Adam to ever see the code behind the curtain. Cue the Indiana Jones face-melting gif.
An update yesterday also added Steam trading cards, as well as giving you the option to flick between classic and premium graphics.

It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don't particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin'?
This gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I've had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I'm live and uncensored, baby. I'm going to fire up Among Trees. Let's go and be alone together. But don't worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I'll make sure the final word is a joke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a well known fact that there are "Too Many Games"(TM) these days. I have not done the maths, but I've seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don't try our hardest all the same. 
Inevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, "I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point. Maybe January...? Please don't hate me)

If the goal is to repeat a course 20 times to trim 0.2 seconds off a number, and not to cackle like a petty chaos gremlin as you slam someone off the track at a tight corner, I am probably not going to enjoy myself much.
Rush Rally 3 isn't all that serious, but it's still on the wrong side of the tracks for me, I thought, before accidentally playing it for 3 hours. This is an excellent bundle of rally trials, challenges, and simple circuit racing with a cheerfully mid-2000s feel. I might prefer the messy nonsense of Trail Out, but if you value actual driving skill more highly, this is well worth your time.

D'you see what I did there?
My questions are in bold, and Vincke's answers are undeneath - and they are both amusing and instructive. I for one hope that Wyll's romcom visit home becomes a future winter DLC.

Perhaps it's because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I'm likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you're giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I'll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.


First though, it's time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol' shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I'd probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games are bringing a custom arcade mode, new filters, and more to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. 
This news comes by way of a Steam blog post for the game that reveals this new update is available to download right now. It includes a new custom arcade mode, CRT and VCR filters, and additional fixes and changes to the game. 


"The update implements Custom Game options, granting ninjas greater control over their tubular battle against the Foot Clan through 11 mix-and-match modifiers reminiscent of the dip switches found on old school arcade machines," a press release reads. "Retro-themed filters and an extra large serving of refinements round out the surprise update, which reaches PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox players today." 
Here is a look at the Custom Game options dip switch board: 
As you can see, it looks like there's plenty to mix and match to make each custom arcade session feel unique. If you're interested, be sure to boot the game up today and get the update downloading. 
For more, read Game Informer's TMNT: Shredder's Revenge review. You can also read how TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection got a patch yesterday that adds online play to the SNES version of Turtles in Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Santa Monica Studio has announced that God of War Ragnarök, which hit PlayStation consoles last month, is getting a New Game Plus mode in spring. 
This news comes by way of a short and sweet tweet posted today by the studio that says Spring 2023 is when fans can expect the feature to hit Ragnarök. As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll "share more details once we get closer to the release." 


While many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game's director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nope, you don't need to get your eyes tested. Alt254 is a minimalist action adventure game that plays out on a small (albeit greatly enlarged) map that measures just 21x26 pixels. In this tiny space, you, a black dot, must venture forth, solving puzzles, deciphering the strange, colourful world around you and piecing together your broken memory along the way. It's a very enigmatic little game, but one that's instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair


In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

I was wrong. Don’t look shocked, it happens. Today sees three of the earliest Fallout games being offered up for nothing. They’re Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood Of Steel. I already own all three elsewhere, as you might well too, but if you don’t then it’s a good way of picking up three classics of 90s PC gaming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tradition is a transformative power. Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event's core, and that doesn't matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.

Along with Roach’s early Christmas present of some stabilisers, the hotfix also tackles the annoying bug that caused toxicity to be stuck at max level, along with some minor tweaks to photo mode, and unexplained improvements for The Witcher 3’s performance on Steam Deck.

But given the game's subject centres on the depiction of women on film, and their exploitation in the film industry by male creators, it felt appropriate to examine it from the extremely talented femme members of the team. That means not just the star Marissa Marcel herself, played by the award-winning Manon Gage, but other women and non-binary creatives who played different roles in bringing this game to life.

New, temporarily common locations are a clever way of mixing things up, imposing restraints or possibilities depending on how much you tinker with your decks. 
The latest location, Vormir, is a bit borked. I just spent a minute or so swapping emotes with someone while the game tried to load our (unrelated) animations, which might not sound like much but constitutes a good third of a match's normal running time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that's a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it's oh so satisfying.
We've written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you might have noticed, there’s just a few days until Christmas lands on us all like an overladen sleigh pulled by some very exhausted and confused reindeers. Overwatch 2’s marking the occasion by turning robotic damage hero Bastion into a gingerbread automaton with a new legendary skin. Seeing as it’s the holidays, Blizzard are charging just a single Overwatch Coin for the skin, which is way, way less than the thousands that legendaries usually cost. Bastion’s fresh look is also quite a bit more involved than some of the other legendary efforts Blizzard’s dreamt up for Overwatch 2 so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven't played enough to give you a big wot I think. It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.
Yaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.

The lockdown was announced in a tweet, which only cryptically referred to the cause.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2013’s Risk of Rain is getting an enhanced remake, and it’s coming next year to celebrate its 10th birthday. Titled Risk of Rain Returns, it spruces up the original with improved art, new survivors, and more.
Announced during Nintendo’s House of Indies: Holiday Event Day 2 today, Risk of Rain Returns expands upon the first game while applying the lessons and improvements of Risk of Rain 2. Although Returns does not adopt the sequel's 3D art direction, it features new HD pixel art, balancing tweaks, and new music tracks from composer Chris Christodoulou. It also has improved multiplayer, with other content updates to be shared in the future. Check out the animated announcement trailer below. 


In a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox. 
Risk of Rain Returns will be available on Switch and PC. To learn more, check out our review for the original Risk of Rain here. Be sure to also visit our evolving list of upcoming video game remakes.]]></summary>

This update is called Arenas, and as the name suggests, it adds nine new maps that feature combat challenges. Overcoming these missions unlocks new modifiers that introduce alternative combat moves, cheats, and outfits. Arenas also arrives in March and serves as the latest addition in a roadmap of seasonal post-launch updates that have bolstered the title with more cosmetics, cheats, difficulty settings, and even a replay editor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian's now-traditional Panel From Hell method of update delivery dumped some important Baldur's Gate 3 news last week. The weighty Dungeons & Dragons fantasy RPG has been in early access for a couple of years, but it's now scheduled for a 1.0 release in August next year. As well as that, BG3 got its ninth update, the last significant one before release, which raises the level cap to 5 and adds Paladin as a playable class. I caught up with Larian's founder and director Swen Vincke (this time sans full suit of armour) and he told me that, despite Update 9 being a big one, there's still a lot to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I were only allowed to give a single, solitary reason for trying Control, I’d probably settle on this: it has the most satisfying “throw desk at face” interaction I’ve experienced in a game. Yes, even more so than Half-Life 2. Maybe it’s the slower flying speed of the desk, giving you more time to anticipate the blow. Maybe it’s the recoil of the face. Or maybe it’s just how the desk, or whichever piece of office fixture you’re telekinetically hurling, impacts in a hilarious explosion of shards and scraps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 was finally re-revealed earlier this summer, after nearly a decade of development across three different studios. Many have been anticipating this long-awaited sequel since its original reveal back in 2014, just a few years following the franchise's start. That's why I went to Nottingham, England, to go hands-on with the game for more than seven hours. And soon, you can read everything I learned because Dead Island 2 bloodies up this month's cover of Game Informer. 
Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I visited Dambuster Studios in Nottingham to play two extensive portions of Dead Island 2, talk with the game's director about its development and why the team started with a blank slate, learn from the narrative lead about why a game with "island" in its name is set in…]]></summary>

A new patch, 1.16, has also gone live for Sifu today to duff up some pesky crashes and bugs, although patch notes haven’t been released yet.

The sequel to Star Wars: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, was announced some time ago, but developer Respawn Entertainment has remained mostly silent on what to expect. That changed earlier this month when a new gameplay trailer pulled the veil back on several new gameplay features, not to mention an impending March release date. We followed up with game director Stig Asmussen to learn more details about the anticipated title.

Good grief, I can’t even remember the last time I played a Broken Sword. The first one is a classic adventure game from a time when they were beginning to fade from PC, goat puzzle notwithstanding.

Alone or with a party of pals, you head into dungeons to mash AI-controlled monsters and fill your pockets with loot. Other players are out there doing the same, and might come to claim your goodies, especially as you're all competing for the limited escape portals that let you keep your shinies. It's an interesting one, and doing well on both Steam and Twitch.

After applying yesterday’s PC hotfix, performance with the new ray tracing settings is majorly improved, and if you don’t (or can’t) use those, The Witcher 3 no longer runs slower than it did before the next-gen update hobbled it. 


That’s judging by some tests I’ve run using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, on which overall stability seems to have improved as well. I’m still having trouble with AMD graphics cards, however, with FSR upscaling being a particularly reliable source of crashes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Do not be afraid to die." That's the advice of Haemimont Games' CEO Bisser Dyankov when it comes to playing their new open world survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn. Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you're at it. 
The world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded's initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I've settled on a couple of vital dos and don'ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don't: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it's going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to "challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge," Dyankov tells me. "Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it's a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable." I'll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors' legs off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How was your year for PC hardware, reader? Pick up anything nice, or got any old favourite gear still going strong? I’m still very happy with the 4K gaming monitor I got for a pittance, and have spent the past twelve months becoming increasingly convinced that tenkeyless keyboards are, in fact, the best keyboards.


That’s just me, though. On an everyone’s-invited macro level, 2022 ended up being the most transformative year for PC gaming kit in recent memory. We’ve had it all: long overdue launches, bitter disappointments, and genuinely impactful performance innovations. Also, Valve made a handheld PC. That was cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Duelyst 2! It's a thing! It's a thing with a free public beta you can play right now, and it's a good enough thing to be worth the risk of your boss coming over to ask why your screen is full of gorgeous battling wizards and creatures rather than spreadsheets. 
Duelyst the first boasted a dead clever combination of card-battling and physical manoeuvring, a bit like Marvel's Midnight Suns but better and multiplayer. I was sad when it died. This is by a different team of developers, and it's more of a revival with a few tweaks than a true sequel. Who cares, I can play Duelyst again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).
The setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite developer Epic Games is settling two complaints made to the US Federal Trade Commission by paying out a total of more than half a billion dollars. Wall Street Journal report that the FTC alleged Epic had violated protections intended to secure children’s privacy, and tactically drove players to make unintended purchases that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).


A federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After all these years of going fast, it would appear that Sonic (T. Hedgehog) has finally arrived. He’s thrown off the shackles of individuality and joined the open-world herd with Sonic Frontiers, a game that sees the blue blur himself canter and gambol across primarily barren environments that closely resemble the default assets that ship with certain game engines. Do I seem embittered? Perish the thought. I’m happy for Sonic, honestly. He’s made it. He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s! He may as well have been kissed on the nips by Jesus Christ himself.

When he shared a clip of his antics on Twitter, Super Louis insisted the whole game is playable using the big knife. The honorary Soldier says he’s hoping to have a full video of his time spent pretending to be Cloud up on his YouTube channel today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix announced its Final Fantasy pixel remasters of the series' first six games in June of last year, and over the course of roughly eight months, each of those remasters hit PC platforms. Fans have been waiting since that announcement for the reveal of console versions of these remasters and finally, Square Enix has revealed that all six are coming to PlayStation and Switch next year. 
More specifically, these pixel remasters will hit PlayStation 4 and Switch sometime in the spring of 2023. Each of these games can be purchased individually or together as a bundle, and a limited physical edition will also be available on the same day. Here's a look at what to expect in the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster: FF 35th Anniversary Edition: 
Final Fantasy I-VI Collection - physical collection of all games for either PS4 or Nintendo Switch
Anniversary Edition goods box
A bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package
2-disc vinyl record set featuring newly arranged game music with exclusive cover artwork by Kazuko Shibuya
A specially compiled artbook showcasing beautiful character pixel art 
Eight stylized pixel art character figures in window packaging
This edition of the game is available exclusively on the Square Enix Store and its first batch is already sold out (although you can join a waiting list here)
The company says a "small run of physical standard editions [of the collection] will also be available exclusively from the Square Enix Store from Spring 2023," but notes that quantities will be "extremely limited" so if you're interested, you should preorder. 
For more information about each of these pixel remasters, head to Square Enix's blog post. Check out our ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game to find out where Final Fantasy I-VI land on our list after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has revealed that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


"What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we've been in absolute awe of the work of our peers," Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. "Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here's to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall." 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, "Following the events of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel's Spider-Man series." 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales.

The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector's edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We'll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it's somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X.

        <updated>2022-12-15T13:01:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village's VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn't just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


"A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters' journey takes full advantage of the headset's advanced features," a press release reads. "VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever."
Capcom says the platform's PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
"These [controllers] represent Ethan's famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game," Capcom writes in a press release. "Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.
