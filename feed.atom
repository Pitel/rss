One of today's had TheRetroRunner taking on a Low% run of Ninja Gaiden on NES, and the fact that it nearly ended in defeat really showcases what makes these events special in the first place.


For those unfamiliar with the Low% category for Ninja Gaiden — I had never seen it before myself — it's essentially a sword-only run with some key restrictions. While it's okay if you pick up a few items by accident, you can't use them on enemies and you can't pick up anything that automatically activates. That means no fire wheel, no time stopping, and no health potions. 


Thankfully, TheRetroRunner and others who run this category have plenty of tricks up their sleeves. …]]></summary>

After all, the new game is entirely multiplayer-focused and heavily reliant on co-op. Crossplay and cross progression are important for titles like this since they allow for a larger player pool and preserve in-game progression for those who choose to play on multiple platforms. Thankfully, there's good news on both fronts for the players.


Does The First Descendant have crossplay?


The answer is yes—Nexon's latest sensation offers crossplay on all available platforms. It doesn't matter if you're playing on a PC and your friend is playing on a console. In fact, there's full crossplay support between the consoles as well, irrespective…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consumer Softproducts has released a 9-minute-ish compilation of Psycho Patrol R gameplay snippets onto YouTube today. If you were wondering how much like Cruelty Squad the new game would be; it’s looking like a lot.


It’s really hard to tell if this is a rough cut from a still-in-development game or if this is actually what things are going to be like. It’s hard to tell after you’ve played Cruelty Squad.


It does show off things like swearing for some reason, as well as mech fights and mech customization. In Psycho Patrol R, you sometimes pilot your V-Stalker Mecha. Other times, you do not. But when you do, you can swap out the guns on its left and right arms, as well as its crotch.




The compilation also shows off rappelling down a building, which looks pretty neat. You’re also followed by a floating ball with stars around it (Bion?).


It looks enjoyable, but it’s really hard to describe why. Cruelty Squad was one of the most difficult games for me to review. I absolutely like the game, but trying to describe it makes it sound horrible. The graphics look like the sort of dream that Windows Me wakes up screaming from, and the music is like the game accidentally loaded the wrong sound file, was embarrassed, and spontaneously began remixing it instead of admitting to its mistake. The narrative and gameplay only sort of make sense. It’s incredibly uncomfortable to play, and it feels like it hates the player. But you should definitely play it.


Psycho Patrol R looks like it’s going to be the same. I look forward to when it releases, which could be anytime between tomorrow and 10 years from now. It’s really hard to tell how close to completion it is based on the video.


Psycho Patrol R doesn’t have a set release window, but it is planned for PC.

Which Comoem evolution is better in Pokémon GO?


Strategically, Solgaleo is the safer bet due to its greater number of resistances and higher bulk. You may run into more weaknesses with the lion, but at least you could have a shot at winning if you're leveled up enough. That being said, I wouldn't blame you for choosing Lunala just because it looks cool. Both are fairly good either way for Pokémon GO's PvP battles, so it's a win-win either way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been trying to log into Xbox, you may have stumbled upon the error code 0x87DD0033. This issue prevents you from signing in, ultimately locking you out of games. Here's how to fix the error code 0x87DD0033 on Xbox.


Xbox 0x87DD0033 error code solution


The Xbox 0x87DD0033 error code occurs during a server outage or when experiencing a connection issue. Currently, the Xbox Status page has revealed a major outage for the Account and profile section. Multiple users have also indicated that they are encountering the error on Down Detector. That means you won't be able to log in until the servers have cleared up.


Fortunately, the Xbox Support page is aware of the issue and has confirmed that they are looking into the error code:




The Support page also recently concluded service maintenance for Destiny 2, which may have something to do with the error code. We'll just have to wait and see how long it takes to clear out the entire network for it to work properly. It's best to keep track of this on the Xbox Status page, which provides the current status of various platforms. 


Screenshot via Xbox Support


If the servers are running, you may need to check your internet connection. You'll need to ensure that the connection is stable in order to clear up the 0x87DD0033 issue. Most online games, like The First Descendant, won't allow you to play them unless you are signed into Xbox. So, you'll need to clear up any internet issues beforehand to get it up and running.


We'll be sure to update this guide once the Xbox Live servers are working again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bugs and errors in video games and live service platforms can catch you by surprise, especially if there's seemingly no way to fix the issue. Occasionally, Xbox will encounter server-wide errors that affect thousands, potentially millions of players, with a fix taking some time to appear. In the meantime, you can check Xbox's server status to see if it's a server-side problem or a client-side issue you can fix within minutes.


How to check Xbox server status


The two main ways to check Xbox's server status is to view the official Xbox Status support page, social media such as the Xbox Support X account, or third-party sites like Downdetector if you suspect the support page isn't up-to-date. More often than not, at least one of these resources will reveal issues with Xbox's services, with specific categories such as account and login problems, cloud gaming bugs, or store and subscription errors, if any exist.


In most cases, you'll have to wait until Microsoft resolves these issues. Occasionally, the solution is as easy as restarting your Xbox, turning your router on and off, or double-checking your Xbox account to see if it's an account-related problem. However, the most common situation is that it's a server-side error on Xbox's end that Microsoft has to step in and fix before you can play your games again. 


If Xbox's server status pages show that everything is operational, there's a chance your error or issue is a game-specific bug or an issue with your console. In this case, you may have to run some troubleshooting with your Xbox, such as seeing if it's a hardware issue or diving into a particular game's server status to see if the error only impacts one or two games.

It’s safe to say that if there’s one map where flying is essential, it’s Living Memory. Before you can take off on your mount of choice, you’ll need to collect 15 Aether Currents - 10 in the field, four through side quests and one through the MSQ.

These might take you a while to gather up, due to the nature of Living Memory and how disconnected everything is. To make this easier, I’ll split these into groups depending on which area of Living Memory you can find them:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Shape expansion for Destiny 2 brought an array of new weapons for you to collect. Between the Pale Heart weapons and their powerful Origin Trait, and the Salvation's Edge weapons, there's plenty to play with. 


I've been running three separate Pale Heart weapons for that crispy Super regen on my Prismatic Warlock as one great example. One weapon is quite useful but can be hard to get good stats for. Here's the god roll for the Lost Signal grenade launcher in Destiny 2, including the best perks and attachments.


The best perks, barrel, and magazine for the Lost Signal grenade launcher in Destiny 2


The Lost Signal is particularly interesting. For one, it's acquired through Echo Engrams which only house a specific set of weapons. However, it also sports the new Area Denial Frame which launches grenades in a burst. These leave small areas that damage enemies that step inside it, similar to the Witherhoard. All of this makes it a great weapon for quickly dealing with hordes of ads, and two perks along with some attachments can make great use of that. Those are as follows:



Barrel: Hard Launch


Magazine: High-Velocity Reserves


Perk 1: Auto-Loading Holster


Perk 2: One For All



If you know your attachments well, you may be wondering what the reason is for Hard Launch. Well, stats like Blast Radius don't affect the Area Denial Frame on Grenade Launchers, so the size of these areas should remain the same while greatly increasing the projectile speed. High-Velocity Rounds further increase the grenade's projectile speed, making it much more consistent. Auto-Loading Holster is the bread and butter, letting you shoot out some grenades and then use another weapon for mopping up remaining enemies. One For All gives damage for hitting multiple targets, and that shouldn't remotely be a concern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logging onto a game you're excited to play only to experience bugs or connection issues is never fun. The First Descendant has also fallen victim to this, with various errors appearing as you log in or teleport to areas in the game. Fortunately, Nexon has actively worked on these issues, and there are ways to check its server status to see if the error you're facing is client-side, server-side, or completely unrelated. 


How to check The First Descendant server status


The First Descendant has numerous ways to check its server status, from its official X (Twitter) page to its Discord server. However, the most reliable way to stay up-to-date on current issues is The First Descendant's news page, where Nexon actively reports on patch notices, urgent errors, and other important details. You can also view this page for information on upcoming events and features.


Currently, The First Descendant's servers are online, with Nexon resolving several beta and launch issues shortly after its release. Over time, more patches will continue to be released in updates, which may cause some downtime if they're major fixes or ones that require server reboots. 


However, there may occasionally be times when it is not The First Descendant's fault at all. For example, if you're playing on consoles, you may experience Xbox server errors instead, which are completely unrelated to specific games. In such situations, you'll have to wait for your PC or console's services to return before logging into The First Descendant or other games you're interested in playing.

Ys III: Wanderers from Ys was an interesting entry in the series since it used a sidescrolling perspective. This wasn’t super popular, so for Oath in Felghana, Nihon Falcom moved it back to (mostly) top-down. There was still some platforming. It was also followed in 2006 by Ys: Origin, a fantastic prequel that was actually my introduction to the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that The First Descendant is a looter-shooter at its core, you'll be swapping in and out a lot of loot as you rank up. It might be for the different stats or weapon types, but without a doubt, your inventory will fill up fast. 


With all this in mind, you might find it helpful to store some weapons you don't need to have on you at all times. Here's how to store gear in The First Descendant.


How to put gear in your personal storage in The First Descendant


Image via Destructoid.


To store gear, you want to travel to the main hub of Albion if you aren't there already. Once there, turn immediately to the right and you should see a big box on legs that you can interact with. Once you speak to it, you'll get access to your Storage screen, where you can see anything you've already stored away. If you're reading this guide though, this Storage should be empty. Tab over to the Inventory screen to access the items on your person.


From there, it's as simple as clicking on the piece of gear you want to store and it'll automatically get moved over to Storage. You may not want to put stuff in storage early in your time with The First Descendant, but later on, this menu should prove invaluable.


Can you increase the space in your personal storage?


It is possible to increase the space in your personal storage, but this comes with a huge caveat. Each storage space costs 25 of the game's premium currency Caliber. This can be earned in-game, but as expected, it's extremely rare and in small quantities. Either way, your personal storage can be increased by an additional 1000 slots from the standard 76.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In every expansion, Final Fantasy XIV adds a bunch of new dungeons and Dawntrail is no different. Past those which are part of the MSQ, there are two more to unlock once you’ve reached level 100 and you’ll need them if you want to play Duty Roulette: Expert. 


If you loved Shadowbringers and the mechanics it introduced, you’re going to really enjoy Tender Valley. Contrary to the name, the mobs and bosses in this dungeon hit hard (or maybe that’s just my less-than-satisfactory gear talking), and include some familiar faces, but I won’t spoil the surprise any more than that. 


This is one of two post Dawntrail MSQ dungeons which are currently available, the other being The Strayborough Deadwalk.

The unlock quest for Tender Valley will become available once you’ve completed the level 100 MSQ quest ‘Dawntrail’. 


After you’ve done that, head to Bayside Bevy Marketplace in Tuliyollal and find Zeycihan (X:14.6, Y:13.4). Pick up the level 100 blue side quest ‘It Belongs in a Museum’, then you’re going to have to head to Shaaloani, because what better place to take on a whole troop of sentient Cacti with murderous intent?


Speak to Zeycihan again, and then head into Tender Valley to do what his hired group of mercenaries couldn’t - explore the ruins, overcome the enemies you find within and discover the hidden secrets of the ruins. 


Like I said, some of the mechanics in here will be joyfully familiar to you, including a direct recreation of the first fight within the Qitana Ravel. Others will be more unfamiliar, but they’re easy to get to grips with as long as you pay close attention to tiny, needle-like details.

        <updated>2024-07-02T17:51:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right before Christmas 2022, developer Bulwark Studios and publisher Kasedo Games released a Sci-Fi city-builder titled IXION on Steam. I admittedly knew little about the game, but as a fan of Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus, a tactical strategy game by the same duo, I decided to give it a shot. It ended up being one of my favorite games of 2022, and the city builder is now set to hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in early 2025.




In IXION, players take on the role of the Administrator of the Tiqqun, a prototype space station built by one of the most powerful and influential companies on Earth, DOLOS. An unexpected cataclysmic event occurs and the station suddenly becomes humanity's last bastion of survival as it soars through space. It's rare to see a quality story in a city-builder, but IXION's is top-notch especially for fans of science fiction. 


As you progress through IXION you'll not only unlock more building elements and features, but learn more about the stations creators, the cataclysmic event that occurred, and more while also making decisions that will affect the human race in its entirety. The only other game I can really think of to compare it to is Frostpunk in that you'll often be tasked with making tough decisions that you think are the best in the moment.


I'll admit, I'm not entirely convinced that a more intricate city builder like IXION will feel quite as intuitive on a controller as opposed to a keyboard and mouse. But with how much IXION  continuously surprised me when I played through it, I'm confident that if anyone can pull it off it's Bulwark Studios.


IXION is scheduled to release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in Q1 2025. It's currently available on PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leveling up your mastery rank in The First Descendant is key to increasing your module capacity, inventory space, and other important character components. You'll also gain unique new features, from ability enhancements to specific locations and weapon readjustment. Here's how to gain mastery experience points and rank up your mastery to take advantage of these buffs.


How to gain Mastery points in The First Descendant


You'll obtain mastery experience points as you play The First Descendant. You gain mastery EXP over time as you complete missions for the first time, increase your weapon proficiency, and raise your character's level. You can find your progress toward your next mastery level in your inventory menu, just below your character level.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Generally speaking, defeating monsters or repeating the same missions won't net you mastery points. Instead, focus on using various weapon types and obtaining first-time completion rewards for missions if you want to max out your mastery.


How to rank up Mastery level in The First Descendant


Increasing your mastery rank requires returning to Albion and visiting Prime Hands, the Arche Factor Manipulator. You can find Prime Hands in the eastern portion of Albion, near the mailbox and Special Operations Terminal. When you max out your first mastery level, you'll receive a quest to visit Prime Hands, highlighting its location on your map.

Once you locate Prime Hands, select Mastery Rank Up to read up on the game's guide on mastery. In short, it'll tell you about mastery rank EXP and the benefits you receive from levels. After reading it, confirm your rank up to reach your next mastery level.

If you’ve ever thought “hey, this dungeon seems pretty tame, the scenery isn’t attacking me or anything”, then the Strayborough Deadwalk is absolutely the dungeon for you. If you want my advice, don’t stop to smell the roses and absolutely don’t stop to appreciate the backdrop - it attacks, and it hurts.

Once you’ve completed the MSQ, including the final level 100 quest ‘Dawntrail’, head on back to Solution Nine and talk to Nostalgia outside the entrance to the Backrooms (X:19.8, Y:17.1). She’ll have a level 100 quest for you to pick up called ‘Something Stray in the Neighborhood’. 


This is the quest which will eventually reward you with The Strayborough Deadwalk, but you need to complete a few steps first, beginning with traveling to Living Memory. Wait at the designated location and talk with Nostalgia again, before heading off to find Constancy below the Ferris Wheel in Yesterland. 


Somehow, he’s still there and tells you about a lost borough of Living Memory, which can suddenly be accessed through a tear in the fabric of reality. After a cutscene, you’ll quite literally dive into the tear and emerge in what can only be described as the world's most twisted theme park.

Tsukihime is responsible for a lot of things. Back in 2000, Type-Moon’s classic visual novel captivated audiences with a story crammed full of occult mystery, thrilling action, and heart-pounding character drama. Like jagged lines splintering out of a unified core, its success spread out in many different directions: adaptations across manga and anime, the production of a number of sequel VNs, the birth of Type-Moon’s mega-popular Fate franchise, and, of course, the creation of its very own fighting game series Melty Blood. It’s no stretch to say that Tsukihime is a cornerstone of the industry, which is exactly why the title’s fade into relative obscurity is such a surprise.
For all the waves it made in the time during and after its release, Tsukihime has never been graced with an official Western localization. Moreover, the original Japanese release has long since become abandonware, with the task of preserving the game online falling to diehard fans. Suffice to say, it’s not the fate that a game many champion as one of the best in its genre deserves. Fortunately, Type-Moon has seen fit to rectify that problem by way of a full-on remake project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

We often use the word 'evergreen' to describe a game which never gets old. Despite the passage of time, there's a stratum of untouchables that still feel as vital in the hands as the day they were released. Personal preferences and nostalgia will always, always come into play, but games like Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World? It's hard to imagine them feeling any better if they launched yesterday.
Critical consensus puts classics like those on a pedestal which seems precarious — they can't be that good, right? — but whenever you return, they do, somehow, stand up. You settle back and relax, relieved. You need never worry that a quick blast through SMB3 won't live up to your expectations.

Remember right before the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom when rumours began to circulate that Princess Zelda might be a playable character? That wish was never granted (sorry, spoilers), but the Hylian monarch is getting her time in the spotlight this September when The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom grants her the starring role.
We are, of course, pumped to finally get the chance to play solely as Zelda in a mainline game, but being a 2D, top-down adventure, there is still a little bit of us that wonders what a game starring the Princess might look like in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom's art style.

One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

Nintendo is continuing to clamp down on Switch piracy this week by filing two brand-new lawsuits (thanks, TorrentFreak).
The first of these targets Modded Hardware, a group that has been on Nintendo's radar for a few months now — and with a name like that, you can imagine why. Run by Ryan Daly (aka "Hombrew Homie", apparently) Modded Hardware had built up a reputation for selling fully modded Switch consoles, memory cards that enable pirated downloads and other modding services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

If you've been wanting to give the Switch Online service another shot, but don't necessarily want to fork out the monthly sub for it, Nintendo is now offering Switch users a free 7-day trial.
This allows you to "retry the benefits" of this membership service, even if you've tried it out in the past. This will give you access to the base tier which comes packed with the NES, Super Nintendo and Game Boy libraries. As noted by Nintendo, this allows you to access more than "100+ classics".

Following a system firmware update in June (bumping the Switch up to Version 18.1.0), Nintendo has now rolled out another "rebootless" update.
This has been detailed by dataminer 'OatmealDome' on social media, who once again mentions how these updates "do not require the console to be restarted and often contain minor changes". This latest build has (you guessed it) updated the "bad words list". We won't go into specific details but it appears to block a "censor-evading way" to write a certain word in Japanese.

There are five different products in this exclusive range with the regional brands adding a subtle hint of Nintendo iconography to their respective craft. A paper fan from the Kyoto-based company Hakuchikudo displays a gorgeous, hand-inked line-up of familiar faces. Ayanokoji's trio of pouches brandish Nintendo silhouettes in pastel colours. Tie company Nekado keeps things formal with a pair of Nintendo-themed neckwear. It's not quite as in-your-face as the usual Nintendo merchandise, but it's a mighty fine selection nonetheless.

There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. "We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons," the developers say. But wait, isn't there a slide kick in the game already?

Some say it's a "boss rush" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good.

        <link href="http://www.abclinuxu.cz/zpravicky/virtualni-bastlirna-vol.-40-letni-bastleni"/>
        <updated>2024-06-30T09:26:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prázdniny začínají a nebastlíři leží na plážích nebo se vystavují nebezpečnému UV záření mimo kontrolované prostředí laboratoře. Strahováci však stále sledují, co se děje nového ve světě techniky a v pondělí se novinkám na Virtuální Bastlírně podívají na zoubek.

Altium změnilo licenční model, což způsobilo vlnu nevole. KiCADu v posledních verzích postupně přibývá podpora importu z Altia - nahrálo Altium nechtěně do karet KiCADu? Co ale ze světa hardwaru?

LilyGO začíná prodávat levné "chytré" brýle s ESP32. Z Číny se dají kooupit procesory s BT 5.0 pod dolar. Vznikla open-source aktivní sonda do 2 GHz - zmíní i jak se dělají kabely k osciloskopickým sondám. Nedávno také bastlíři vyzkoušeli Faradayův jev v oleji a mají i video. Nesmí ale zapomínat i na software.

Kromě nové verze KiCADu si můžeme ukázat drobné zlepšováky pro LTSpice - import bloků s S-parametry nebo export schémat do pěkné prezentovatelné podoby. Nově vznikl i fork AR488 podporující ethernet místo USB připojení. Nezapomínají však ani na naše oblíbená úsměvná až bizarní témata!

Změna licence zřejmě konečně po 20+ letech umožnila Altiu zprovoznit podporu pro jednovrstvé plošné spoje. Adam H. na dovolené hackuje RFID zámky (ale o tom více poví osobně až někdy příště). Na zubních kartáčcích s ESP32 se šíří botnet. Vzniká český vesmírný program (bohužel se nejmenuje Kosmo) a vznikla podpora pro psaní programů v .NETu na prehistorickou konzoli NES/Famicom.

Jak vidíte, seznam zajímavých témat na tento měsíc je vskutku obsáhlý. Neváhejte tedy, nažhavte svoje počítače, repráky, mikrofony a kamery a připojte se s námi na Virtuální Bastlírnu XL. Nejde však o velikost, jen o pořadové číslo 40 - VB je tu pro všechny nezávisle na velikosti, věku či čemkoliv jiném.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 1. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

The court ordered Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco to poison their DNS records to prevent these third-party services acting as workarounds for existing pirate site blockades. Cisco's response became evident on Friday when it withdrew its OpenDNS service from the entire country.

Now the board game's first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it's called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further.

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think I've written about it a bazillion times here on RPS, but I do think Elden Ring is a massive open world game that's a bit too large and in charge. I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact I think it's very good. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it's a great thing, personally.

In 2022, the High Court said the devices could be sent to the United States to assist in Dotcom's criminal prosecution there. Following Dotcom's inevitable appeal, the Court of Appeal has now dismissed the proceedings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the open world series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, via one of those odd promotional things disguised as a conversation. They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. 
But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart …]]></summary>

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Albatroz is a "backpacking adventure RPG" that takes place in The Forbidden Lands, a photogenic wilderness "where two worlds converge". You are jaded city worker Isla, and you are here to search for your missing brother, who was himself searching for the mystical mountain of Albatroz - locally known as "the walking mountain", for reasons that you will never guess. There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A gamer who impersonated an anti-piracy partner working for Bungie as part of a bogus DMCA takedown notice campaign on YouTube, agreed to a $8.1m copyright infringement judgment. Nicholas Minor, aka Lord Nazo, sent 96 fraudulent takedown notices against creators in the Destiny 2 community early 2022. An injunction targeting the defendant aims to ensure there's no repeat of any similar behavior, anywhere in the world, ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

Metaphor: ReFantazio, the first (going by the colon usage) in a new series of RPGs helmed by Persona series director Katsura Hashino, is no exception. It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

        <updated>2024-06-27T13:31:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the ageing, silent character you play in puzzle adventure Selfloss performs a roll, it is a tumble of such poignant melancholy I spent the first five minutes of my time with its Steam demo just keeling about in the starting area. It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

That's because said area is a woodland that's been steeped in shadow and chaos for so long, large goats don't dare clop their hooves. What I hadn't expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It's made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring's open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live service games such as The First Descendant - a Warframe-ish co-op looter shooter coming next month - can often suffer from a chronic case of numbers-itis, a tragic and goopy disease that stagnates game feel, letting raw and tasteless maths multiply and overwhelm what I, in all my critical wisdom, call “fun button pushy.” Developer NEXON Games were kind enough to answer a few of my questions recently, and most of all, I wanted to know how they’d immunised their endgame against this miserable ailment. The aim, NEXON tell me, is in motivating players to try out different approaches to combat rather than relying on flat progression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades 2's third early access patch is of the gargantuan variety. It improves Olympian Boons, adds lots of new UI icons, reworking Keepsakes, and basically touches every aspect of the game you could possibly think of. One thing it doesn't change is how sexy the gods are, but because they're so sexy anyway, I don't think that's an issue moving forwards.

It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.
One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. 
Check out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below:

The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.

Almost ten years after the first game came to PC, and upsettingly close to 20 years from its debut, the original Dead Rising is coming back in a fresh remaster.

Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief stone-shover.

Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet doesn't exist in the world depicted by the film Aliens, though variations of it crop up in the expanded universe. Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallen Aces is a stylish FPS lead pipe ‘em up with immersive sim elements, published by good gun-knowers New Blood Interactive. Your gumshoe ‘tagonist wakes up, hungover of brain, skint of wallet, and unshaven of face, to discover your apartment - undoubtedly reeking of smokerettes and dehydration wee - is being broken into by foes goonly and mookish. They take a while to boot the door down, which gives you a moment to observe the place and consider which of Fallen Aces' expansive makeshift weapon selection you'd like to batter them with. Decisions, decisions...

After eating some fridge fruit, I prepare an ambush by flicking off the lightswitch, then hide behind a desk. When they break in, I bravely sneak up behind them and put the frying pan I picked up to work. The sound effects tell me this a quality bit of cookware. Probably cast iron. Barely a dent. In the pan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game development studio and intergalactic war ministry Arrowhead have launched a new series of written update posts for players of Helldivers 2 to help keep the war record straight. Mostly, this is the usual case of somebody on the team gathering quotes as the developers batter their fingertips against keyboards to bring you, the video gamer, fresh cannons and what-have-you. But there is some insight into what the conflict-pushers at Arrowhead have enjoyed most about player actions over the last month, including bringing an entire planet to the liberated state of post-existence.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/26/the-latest-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-should-make-your-journey-a-bit"/>
        <updated>2024-06-26T11:54:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.

After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.]]></summary>

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

There’s still a demo on Steam at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major recording labels, including UMG and Sony have filed a pair of broadly similar copyright complaints against two key generative AI music services. The RIAA-managed lawsuits accuse the owners of Udio and Suno of copying the labels' music on a massive scale and the labels suggest that they're already on the back foot. In pre-litigation correspondence, both were 'evasive' on content sources before citing fair use, which the RIAA notes only arises as a defense in cases of unauthorized use of copyright works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software games have garnered a reputation – alongside the rest of the Soulslike subgenre – for delivering difficult, punishing experiences that reward persistence with an unparalleled thrill of victory. The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …]]></summary>

They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia. Into that last category comes a new contender: Diablo 4, which will soon introduce a new wave-based roguelike mode in its next season.

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the announcement reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware." 
Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an "Innapropriate activity detected" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.
Elden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It's here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, EA Sports revealed the San Francisco 49ers' Christian McCaffrey graces the Madden NFL 25 (2024) cover, and now the company has formally revealed the game with a new trailer. The official reveal trailer highlights the "next level of FieldSENSE" and new "BOOM Tech," which EA describes as a "new dynamic physics-based tackling system that lets you dominate the gridiron like a bonafide NFL superstar."
The trailer also reveals the Madden NFL 25 MVP Bundle, which includes EA Sports College Football 25, Madden NFL 25, and bonus rewards for both. 
Check it out for yourself in the Madden NFL 25 reveal trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive." 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by "Project Phoenix", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a "visual prototype" for a brand new Red Faction game.

It also allows you to summon your Spectral Steed during the game's final fight (which, if you've beaten that boss, you know how helpful your mount would have been during it). 
The patch – V1.12 – is now live on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam) and also features hundreds of other changes, like adjustments to weapons, skills, armaments, and general balance-related things.

Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the 'default' option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chaos and comedy. Death and rebirth. Luck and, uh, running out of luck. A good roguelike doesn't treat the player like other games do. Roguelikes won't guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They're more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat's hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it's a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right. Next time you'll find the right pair of poison-proof loafers, the perfect co-pilot for your spaceship, a stash of stronger, better ropes. Next time.

It’s only 6GB, and you’ll need it to play the expansion, so do click that button if you haven’t already. The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - were announced last week. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s Albinuaric murdering community: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.
Spoilers for the name of that boss below, if you’d rather not know.

Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough.

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there," Iizuka says. "Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They're very popular and dynamic characters."

Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it's not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic's abilities, but we've seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're at all familiar with the Dragon Age series, you likely already know BioWare has experimented quite a lot with its gameplay. From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloodborne arrived on PS4 in 2015 and immediately became one of the best games of the year, earning a 9.75 out of 10 from Game Informer and even taking home our award for Best PlayStation Exclusive. But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
