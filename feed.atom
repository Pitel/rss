Where to get an Archwing Launcher Segment in Warframe


The Archwing Launcher Segment is an Orbiter modification that allows you to install an Archwing Launcher on your ship. This, as a result, will enable you to deploy your Archwing in open-field areas (Cambion Drift, Plains of Eidolon, and Orb Vallis). This is ridiculously useful for exploring those large areas, as moving on foot will waste a lot of your time. 


That said, there are two ways you can obtain an Archwing Launcher Segment. The first and easiest is to buy it directly from the Warframe Market. …]]></summary>

This time last year, the thought of having a new top-down Zelda in our hands felt like a pipe dream. But then Echoes of Wisdom came along and reaffirmed the idea that the future of the series might not be an exclusively open-world, 3D affair.
But our minds are now drifting to the franchise's other style, one we haven't seen used in isolation since Zelda II (and even then not fully). If Nintendo is open to different game perspectives, is it time for another side-scrolling Zelda?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The One Piece anime hits its fans with a surprise announcement. The beloved anime adaptation of Eiichiro Oda’s legendary manga will be going on hiatus until April 2025. The news was officially revealed via an announcement video, which confirmed that the anime will resume its Egghead arc next spring.




The hiatus will allow the anime's production team to "recharge," as confirmed during the live-streamed special titled "One Piece News #1." To fill the gap left by the hiatus, the One Piece Fan Letter special will air on October 20, followed by a special edited version of the fan-favorite Fish-Man Island arc on October 27. 


According to Anime News Network, this version of the arc will offer a fresh viewing experience, featuring retouched art, enhanced color shading and lighting, special effects, and a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.


In addition to the anime, One Piece is expanding its presence in the digital space. One Piece Base, a new smartphone app featuring a manga viewer and other franchise-related content, launches in Japan on Sunday. However, the app is also slated to be released globally next year. 


The app will allow users to unlock chapters using points. These points can be earned via scanning barcodes from One Piece merchandise, logging into the app daily, and inviting friends. The app also includes the portrait maker which transforms fans' selfies into art reminiscent of Oda's signature style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luffy has faced some seriously powerful opponents throughout his One Piece journey. From pirate captains to world-threatening villains, he isn't one to back down from a challenge, especially when his opponent is standing in the way of his goal.


Here’s a rundown of 10 of his most intense duels that had us on the edge of our seats.

Bellamy's defeat is probably the most satisfying


This one might seem like a mismatch at first, but it’s a battle that really shows Luffy’s growth. Bellamy, the cocky pirate, mocked Luffy’s dream and ideals, claiming they were outdated. When they finally clashed, Luffy ended things with a single punch! 


Bellamy may not have put up a great fight against Luffy, but the emotional buildup to their fight was certainly intense. Seeing Bellamy get…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Camellya is one of the most hyped characters upcoming in Wuthering Waves, and her arrival can get here fast enough. With her being announced as a playable character some weeks back, if you're wondering when you can actually start pulling copies of her, here's what you need to know.


When does Camellya come out in Wuthering Waves?


While Kuro Games has not given any details as to when Camellya will officially be released, she has been announced, which does imply a release sooner than you might think if you pay attention to how the banner system works in Wuthering Waves. 


When a character is considered the 'Featured Rate-up', it means they are currently on the banner and available to be pulled. Typically, banners last a few weeks a month, with two total banners taking up the duration of an entire major patch. We know for certain that Camellya will be released in Version 1.4 of Wuthering Waves. Currently, we are in Version 1.3, and the current Rate-up character is The Shorekeeper. After her banner ends, there's a high chance there will be a re-run of a previously released character since no second character was announced by Kuro Games for 1.3.

In a similar vein, there has been no second character announced for Version 1.4. Only Camellya has been officially announced, which suggests that she is the first character to be a Rate-up in 1.4. If this is indeed the case (which is highly likely at this point), that means that Camellya will release following the re-run character in 1.3. In conclusion, based on these insights, Camellya is highly likely to release on November 14, which is just after the re-run character's banner ends and likely when Version 1.4 officially releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the Episode battle mode allows you to enjoy some amazing storylines featuring your favorite characters. 


In total, eight characters are present in the Episode battle mode, but two of them remain locked - Future Trunks and Jiren. Thankfully, you can unlock the paths for both by just playing the game. Doing so not only lets you play out their canonical storyline, but both also have alternate Sparking episodes present. Without wasting any time, let's take a look at how you can unlock and play with Jiren and Future Trunks in the episode battle mode.


How to unlock Future Trunks and Jiren in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero's episodes?


While unlocking Sparking episodes in certain cases can be quite difficult, getting access to Jiren and Future Trunks in Episode mode is easy.


To unlock episodes for both, you'll need to play through Goku's saga. To be more specific, you'll have to end Universe Survival Arc to get access to Jiren's episodes. Similarly, you'll need to complete the Future Trunks Arc to unlock the episodes for Future Trunks. Both these tasks can be achieved in Chapter 7 of Goku's Saga. Incidentally, you'll always begin with Goku when starting Episode battle mode for the first time.

It took me close to two hours to unlock, but it can take less time if you finish your previous quests quicker (quite possibly, given my abilities as a Dragon Ball Sparking Zero player).


Between the two, Future Trunks' saga is a lot more elaborate. He has more episodes for both Canon and Sparking. Jiren's story is a lot more linear, and the episodes don't change a lot based on canon or Sparking (although the ending changes). Ultimately, unlocking the two sagas will not only help you explore greater parts of the story and gain more exp and Zeni while doing so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve finally revealed that Deadlock is going to get ranked mode on October 15, 2024. Despite being unreleased, Deadlock has harnessed immense popularity, and there is no doubt that players would love to grind since this game shows a promising future. This article will tell you everything you need to know about the ranked mode in Deadlock.


Everything you need to know about Ranked mode in Deadlock

Basically, Deadlock will feature 11 Medals that you can attain in the ranked mode. Each Medals will have six levels that you have to progress to advance further. It is also important to know that these Medals are going to be updated once a week.


There are also a few criteria of ranked mode that you have to keep in mind. Here are those criteria:



First, you must have played atleast 50 games to unlock the ranked mode in Deadlock. This criteria is pretty much obvious as developers try to avoid spam of new accounts entering into the ranked mode.


Second, you can’t play the Ranked mode everytime since the servers will only be opened during 1-4 P.M. and 7-10 P.M. Remember, this time is the same across all the regions, and it is not customized to benefit only one region.


Third, you have to play at least seven-ranked matches to actually progress into a new rank each week.


Fourth, you can queue in the solo-ranked mode only.



Also, since the game is still in development, there is no behaviour restriction in the ranked mode. Hopefully, the developers will add this feature in the future or once the game is released.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you went to middle school in the mid-2000s or know a kid who goes to middle school, you probably know the name Rick Riordan. One of the most prolific fantasy authors of our time, Riordan has written dozens of addictive books, and he's showing no signs of slowing down.


I can't think of a writer who's changed my life more than Rick Riordan. Percy Jackson and the Olympians came out around the time I started reading seriously as a hobby, and I've kept myself caught up on his work ever since. There's something magical about Riordan's prose, a charge coursing through every word that magnetizes my eyes to the page whenever I open one of his books.


Riordan has written many books throughout his career, and I'd argue all of them are among the best of their respective genres. However, it would…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After much anticipation, the anime adaptation of Junji Ito’s iconic horror manga Uzumaki has finally arrived. Known for its eerie atmosphere, twisted visuals, and psychological dread, Uzumaki has long been hailed as one of the most haunting works in the horror genre. 


Fans have eagerly awaited its transformation from page to screen. And now, with its debut on Adult Swim’s Toonami block, Uzumaki is bringing Ito’s nightmarish vision to life.




The Uzumaki anime will be a mini-series consisting of four episodes, each airing weekly through mid-October. As of now, two episodes have aired. Here's Uzumaki's full release schedule:



Episode 1 – September 28, 2024 


Episode 2 – October 5, 2024 


Episode 3 – October 12, 2024


Episode 4 – October 19, 2024 



For the uninitiated, Uzumaki centers around the eerie happenings in a small town that becomes obsessed with spirals. It all started with a weird phenomenon, then spiraled into a grotesque horror consuming the entire town.


Studio Drive is in charge of the anime's production, while Production I.G. USA and Adult Swim co-produce the series. The anime was initially set to debut in 2020, but it faced a series of delays that pushed the release back multiple times. 


 Production issues postponed the series in 2021, then complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic further delayed the project to October 2022. But in mid-2022, the creators made the difficult decision to delay the project indefinitely, stating their desire to ensure that the adaptation was not just visually stunning but also true to the spirit of Junji Ito’s original work.

These were, without a doubt, two of the biggest titans of its genre and demographic, and their absence will certainly leave a huge empty hole in the entire anime and manga industry. However, their respective fan bases reacted to each ending with a lot of controversy and mixed opinions.


As someone who has been reading weekly chapters of both My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen for several years, witnessing these series flesh out their stories until the very end has been mind-blowing. While their finales had a lot of issues, one of them excelled, whereas the other failed, and vice versa. So the only remaining que…]]></summary>

There's something nostalgic about Office, and it's not that Counter-Strike fans were all really into playing the Hostage Rescue game mode back in 2004. 


Instead, you're more likely to recognize Counter-Strike: Source's Office from Garry's Mod, where it was repurposed for modes like Prop Hunt. Is it the best map for classic Counter-Strike…]]></summary>

After all, Shangri-La Frontier Season 2 is also releasing this season. But just like every time a new season arrives, there's this initial sense of confusion, especially as to what's happening in the narrative. After all, it's quite a while since the first season aired.


With that in mind, here's everything you need to remember before Season 2 arrives.

What is Shangri-La Frontier about?


Judging Shangri-La Frontier based on its cover alone, it's easy to mistake it as an isekai anime. It, after all, seems to be set in a fantasy world with a half-human, half-bird character as the main character. While that isn't e…]]></summary>

Modern survival horror games looking to recapture the aesthetics and essence of classic titles from the ‘90s often make one fatal mistake. You see, when fans who were around to play Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark: A New Nightmare on the PS1 look back, they do so with a level of fondness that, frankly, makes the games sound like the best things since sliced bread.
The truth, however, is that the earliest survival horror titles, with their awkward controls and fixed camera angles, haven’t aged particularly well; heck, there’s a reason so many of them are getting modern remakes. Veterans will forever adore them (this writer included), but newcomers often come away wondering what all the fuss was about.

Super Mario Party Jamboree isn't out on Switch until next week, but it seems the party may have started early...

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

Europa is a puzzle-platformer that’s light on puzzles and platforming, set on (and named after) the moon of Jupiter. This indie title from Novadust Entertainment and Future Friends Games combines pretty expanses of green with futuristic elements. Its playthrough and story aim to both rouse your inner child and give you philosophical food for thought. Generally, all these things could make for a good game. But while none fail here, none really excel either.
As the game takes off, you hear the voice of your father, inviting you to Europa "if you ever get lonely." You take control of Zee, an android in the form of a young boy who totters past Adam’s gravestone (the father in question) to explore the land. You get a jetpack which you use to hover and glide through each area.

Our interest was piqued when Team17 and Sassy Chap Games announced Date Everything — a game where you can, fittingly, date everything — earlier this year. This sim was initially supposed to release this month, but now the team has announced that it's being pushed back to 14th February 2025 instead.
As outlined in the new trailer (above), the dev is pushing Date Everything's release back by a few months to ensure everything is in tip-top shape for launch. This includes squashing any pesky bugs, tweaking certain areas and making sure all those romance options are as lovely as possible.

And, no, I didn’t simply import and play the Japanese version that had been released six months prior. In the summer of 1994, as a fresh-faced, 16-year-old kid, I played to completion an official, pre-release build of the English version.

Precious few details regarding the project are available at the moment bar a single piece of concept art which you can view below, but the project is said to continue the legacy of Disco Elysium while also introducing a new, groundbreaking ‘psychogeographic RPG’ mechanic.

A representative of Longdue told us that "the studio isn't ready to talk about specific names at the moment beyond the people mentioned in the press release, but they are looking forward to sharing more about the game and the studio in the future". They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps it’s just a testament to the archetypal strength of the image, honestly, but there’s no denying this fallen giant king looks especially gorgeous in Bylina. I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino.

The Xeon 6900P series showed they could tango with the AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa/Bergamo processors in a number of areas, but Genoa has been around since November 2022... With today's AMD 5th Gen EPYC "Turin" launch, Zen 5 is coming to servers and delivers stunning performance and power efficiency. The new top-end AMD EPYC Turin processor performance can obliterate the competition in most workloads and delivers a great generational leap in performance and power efficiency.

To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 won't be an "open sim" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

Despite releasing this year, it’s designed to fit the last-gen AM4 motherboard socket – which sounds strange, because it is, but then the 5700X3D is also the cheapest Ryzen chip to feature AMD’s extremely game-friendly 3D V-Cache tech. The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK.

Which is a shame, as the OLED gaming monitors I’ve used have invariably looked sumptuous, without the movement blurring issues you might expect if you own a TV of the same panel tech. Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No game protagonist is more willing to stick his hand down a toilet than James Sunderland. Why is he doing this? You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those dril tweets about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

Those requirements have since lowered and risen, and now we know for sure that nu-Silent Hill 2 is one tough customer for performance – albeit one that benefits greatly from just one or two key settings tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, "interoperable" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian ISPs are required to work with AGCOM and rightsholders to ensure the Piracy Shield blocking system operates as intended. It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs. That contribution was insulted this week by a legal amendment that threatens ISPs with prison for failing to report piracy to the authorities. Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

My spine now resembles a splinter of charred wood, but oh, so worthwhile. It's an absolute godsend as the days get brisker. My flatmate keeps telling me I shouldn't keep the window wide open if I'm getting cold, but he doesn't understand. I need the airflow. I can handle the chill, but if the air's too still, things go downhill!
So, now that we're all sitting comfortably atop our heat pads: what are we all playing this weekend? Let's take a looksie at what we're all clicking on here in the treehouse.

That sounds plenty appealing, and it now has a release date: October 24th. 

Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest.

Anyway, after reviewing Grunn last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade. Grunn just released today, and my high level tempter is that it’s a little bit like Outer Wilds, just with all the touching wonder replaced by spooky whimsy. Here’s a trailer:

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out 17th October on Steam, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I type these words, specialist wifeguy assessor Brendy is rambling through the fog of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake. Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times. We've taken to calling it "The Curse", such is its power to utterly obliterate video game development, by virtue of it being a phantom that floats into PC vents and fries motherboards. I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I read the words "The Rocky Horror Show", I am swept into a time warp back to the fan screening I attended in 2005. Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks.

As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RIAA and MPA are concerned about a recent court ruling that could hinder their ability to combat online piracy using DMCA subpoenas. The court's decision suggests that IP addresses may not be considered "links", potentially limiting the scope of these subpoenas. This interpretation could impact the music and film industries' efforts to identify and take action against infringers and operators of piracy services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hexworks and CI Games are working on a sequel to 2023 action-RPG Lords Of The Fallen, itself a sequel to 2014 action-RPG Lords Of The Fallen. It's slated to launch in 2026. Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For reasons that seemingly amount to japery, Google have unveiled a double-sided, endlessly looping keyboard design – but only in Japan, and they’re not actually making it. However, the blueprints for 3D-printing it are freely available on GitHub, which is enough to convince me that someone needs to develop some kind of chaotic party game that uses the Möbius strip-shaped Gboard (good spot, Tom’s Hardware) as a controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

"Jiný člověk" je ale "tlumenější" a první půlhodinu vypadá skoro jako normální film, který možná není úplně podařeně natočený. Teprve pak to začne být opravdu divné a vyjde najevo, že to od počátku všechno byl sofistikovaný plán filmařů a že tím asi chtěli něco říct. (Ilča 70 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skoro dokonalý horor. Nepředvídatelný, ale přesto celkem logický děj.

Nepotřebuji to vidět znovu, ale dlouho jsem něco tak kvalitního neviděl a nevšiml jsem si mnoha věcí, které by se daly zlepšit. (Ilča 80 %)]]></summary>
