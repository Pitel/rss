        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to its promise from early this year, Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 has been hard at work improving the game with each subsequent update, delivering some much-needed wins in this respect. The new Update 9 continues this trend with endurance events, but with a huge asterisk in tow.


As I myself have bemoaned time and again here at Destructoid, Forza developers are huge fans of transient, temporary content. The introduction of proper, full-blooded endurance races that take a fair bit of time to wrap up and force the player to consider their tire compound, fuel economy, and other such items has got to be a permanent addition though, right? Well, no, because Forza Motorsport absolutely insists that all of its post-launch content has got to be time-limited. That's right: endurance rac…]]></summary>

Perhaps to help dispel fears of Obsidian meeting the same fate, Carrie Patel and Matt Hansen, the director and art director of the upcoming Avowed, have commented on how supportive they feel Microsoft has been throughout development.


"It's always sad and it always sucks to see studios close and devs lose their job," said Patel in a recent Eurogamer interview.

The following day, though, retailer GameStop advertised the game as launching in November, but it has since admitted this isn't the case at all.


In a now deleted Twitter post from June 10 (which was saved for posterity by IGN), GameStop announced pre-orders were available for Metal Gear Solid Delta, with it scheduled to release on November 17. The deletion of the post made it clear this was done in error, and the official GameStop Twitter account has now clarified the date was never accurate to begin with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's now official - superstar Christian McCaffrey will be present on the cases of Madden 25 as he has been selected as this year's cover star athlete.


There were several candidates, and the speculations have been intense during the last few days. However, the results are now in, and EA Sports has undoubtedly picked a suitable candidate. The 49ers running back has been a phenomenal performer over the years and was selected as the OPOY last season.


Christian McCaffrey could certainly boost sales of Madden 25


2024 will be a big year for EA Sports as far as American Football is concerned. July will witness the launch of EA Sports College Football 25, while Madden 25 is expected to be released globally in August. So far, fans have been waiting for the cover athlete reveal, and Christian McCaffrey is undoubtedly a great choice.


His stocks have risen further following a trade with the 49ers. McCaffrey's talent was already evident for many years, and especially in 2019, when the man completed 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season. This made him only the third athlete to do so, which only shows how unique the achievement is even today.




McCaffrey will hope to go one step further next season, after losing to the Kansas City Chiefs at the Superbowl. Last year, he also led the charts in terms of rushing yards, but a victory at the Superbowl will have been remarkable. Hopefully, he will manage to lead his side to the coveted title next year.


Madden 25 is currently available for pre-order, and you can choose between the Standard and Digital Deluxe Editions. The latter, while being more expensive, offers a lot of extra goodies and three days of early access. The Digital Deluxe Edition is also part of the MVP bundle, which also includes the EA Sports College Football 25 Digital Deluxe Edition at a discounted price.

This is no longer the case, however, as Arrowhead Games has slowed the updating cadence way down ahead of the hotly anticipated spawn rate fix.


"You've probably noticed we've slowed our cadence of patches," said Arrowhead Games on Twitter. "Similar to our future approach to Warbonds, this is so we can dedicate more time to each patch to reduce the pressure on our teams, dig into your feedback more, and deliver higher-quality patches." The wait, thankfully, is almost over, as the big update is dropping in alongside the new Viper Commandos Premium Warbond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.


Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will be concluding, Christian Link stated during a LoL dev update released earlier today that it won't be the last animated story set in the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swords in Destiny 2 have always occupied a weird space in my head. It's a futuristic looter shooter with a heavy emphasis on "shooter." As such, melee weapons seem out of place. Don't get me wrong, they're super fun to play with, I just find them peculiar. Bungie seems to have sensed this and has furthered my feelings with Ergo Sum, an Exotic sword that is a Special weapon and can roll with random Exotic perks. Jump down the rabbit hole with me to get it.


A non-heavy sword with random Exotic perks? Yes, please!


Obtaining Ergo Sum is an involved process. After completing The Final Shape campaign, you can grab the Destined Heroes quest chain. Once Destined Heroes is in the rearview mirror, you can farm additional Ergo Sum rolls by completing Overflow or Pathfinder paths in The Pale Heart…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 servers, like many online games, have encountered a few hiccups throughout its launch, preventing users from logging in. If you're here, you've likely stumbled upon this common roadblock, including a forever loading 'Signing in' screen. In this guide, we'll show you how to fix Destiny 2 Servers Not Available error.


Destiny 2 'Servers are not available' error solutions


To fix the Destiny 2 'Servers are not available error,' try the following methods:



Clear cache


Check Destiny 2 server status page


Change to a wired connection


Ensure that your internet connection is stable


Install new updates


Wait until the servers clear up



One of the first things you can do is check Destiny 2's server status page. The servers are experiencing some issues due to the launch of The Final Shape DLC. That means you may need to wait a bit for Bungie to address the problems. The servers may also be overloaded with too many users, which is why you won't be able to join. Currently, the servers will be down until 10 a.m. PT, but maintenance will continue until 12 p.m.

You can still try to fix problems on your end by ensuring that your internet connection is stable. It is always best to have a wired connection for live service games since it helps stabilize the network and fixes latency issues.


Players should also ensure that the latest updates have been installed. Destiny 2 has received plenty of patches, so you may have an older version that no longer works. However, you'll likely have to clear up more room, as their storage sizes can often be substantial.


If you want to try another method, the Bungie Help page suggests clearing your device's cache. But if all else fails, you may need to wait a bit more for the servers to clear up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game's action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook's journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what's to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer's next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game's main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of errors to go around in Destiny 2, from Cat to Weasel. But if you're here, you've likely stumbled upon Guitar, which quite frankly has nothing to do with music. Here's how to fix Guitar in Destiny 2 and what it means.


Destiny 2 error code Guitar solutions


According to the Bungie Help page, the Guitar error code appears when too many items are on the ground in-game. This can occur whenever you are rewarded with gifts in matches like Gambit.


To fix the Guitar error code in Destiny 2, pick up any objects on the ground or clear your device's cache. Any time there are too many items in a match, including ammo, Orbs of Power, or Engrams, it's best to grab it as soon as possible to avoid the error code. This issue became abundant during the Last Wish Raid and has likely reappeared with Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


If the error persists, clear your device's cache to refresh the game. Console users can simply power off and unplug their devices for five minutes to do this. Steam users can also find a 'Clear Download Cache' via Settings.

Epic Game Store players require a bit more work, so use these methods to clear out the cache:


Clearing cache on PC



Exit Epic Games 


Press the Window key and type in 'R'


Type in '%localappdata%' and hit 'Enter'


Open the 'EpicGamesLauncher' folder


Open the Saved folder


Right-click and delete the files:

webcache


webcache_4147


webcache_4430





Clearing cache on Mac



Exit Epic Games Launcher


Open Finder


Select Go and then 'Go to Folder...'


Type in '~/Library/Caches/com.epicgames.EpicGamesLauncher" and hit Enter


Drag the 'webcache' folder to Trash


Press control and select Trash


Hit 'Empty Trash'



Once the cache has been cleared from your device, the Destiny 2 Guitar error code should be resolved.

Yamal is undoubtedly the breakout youngster of the recently-concluded club football season, and it's always challenging for a wunderkind to shine at a big side like Barcelona. His performances have ensured him a place in Spain's squads in the Euros, and the youngster could even get a spot in the starting lineup.

Is Lamine Yamal in EA FC 24 Euro 2024 mode?


The Euro 2024 is a dedicated game mode in EA FC 24 that allows players to recreate their own versions of the tournament. While EA Sports has included all the updated squads, Lamine Yamal is still missing from Spain's squad. This is the case as of writing (June 11, 2024); although he could be added as part of a future squad update, it's unlikely going to be the case.

Why is Lamine Yamal absent in EA FC 24?


Usually, EA Sports only includes footballers who are 17 years or older when the database is created. As of this writing, Yamal is still 16, which will change on July 13 of this year. This is the main reason why EA Sports has yet to include him in Spain's squad in the Euro 2024 mode. Yamal is also absent from other modes like Ultimate Team.


Could things change in the near future? EA Sports could introduce a special Lamine Yamal card in Ultimate Team after July (once he's 17 years old). I don't think it would happen as the developers are expected to put all the efforts into FC 25, which is expected to be released in September of this year. That could also be the first FC game where Yamal gets added to the database.

Longtime friend of Cayde-6, Micah-10, is the source for a few of these, namely the Convalescence quest chain. Despite what it asks of you, the reward is fantastic, especially if you're running a Prismatic build. Here's how to complete Convalescence and nab Microcosm.

After completing the campaign, you'll obtain the Destined Heroes quest in the Lost City. Several missions in, you'll be introduced to Micah-10, who will give you the Convalescence quest.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know it's coming.
In a rather unusual move for Nintendo, company president Shuntaro Furukawa himself took to Twitter as the firm's end-of-year financials went live in May to confirm two things: a new hardware announcement would be made before the end of the current fiscal year (so, by April 2025 at the latest), and that such an announcement wouldn't be part of a planned Nintendo Direct in June 2024.
This was an attempt to calm speculation concerning the 'Switch 2', which has been the subject of rumours for years at this stage, and the fact that Nintendo had a Direct presentation planned for June was hardly a surprise — looking back at past dates, it's had a big summer presentation most years for the last decade. Still, a heads-up a month early was unexpected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing that XDefiant would get a Search & Destroy mode in the future, executive producer Mark Rubin has confirmed that not only will it arrive in the game, but it's coming quicker than any of us expected. 


Rubin first teased Search & Destroy back on June 5, telling an eager player that the mode was "coming," but didn't go into details about when we would see it. When Season 1 was announced on June 10, it announced that Capture the Flag would be the next mode added, leaving many to feel that Season 2 would be Search & Destroy's time. 


Thankfully, that doesn't appear to be the case, with Rubin confirming that the mode, which will be named "Bomb!" in XDefiant, was being moved up the timeline.

"So I'm hyped for what's coming in Season 1," wrote the executive producer, "but I wanted to charge a change we made to our plans for modes. Our 1-life mode called Bomb! was scheduled for a later season but due to the number of fans who want to see this mode sooner, the team is working on getting it out [as soon as possible]!"




Rubin didn't give an exact release date, but stated that more information would be announced at the next XDebrief, which gives players a look a future plans for the game. While we may still be waiting, the fact that Rubin and the team are listening to feedback from the community and moving forward what we want to see most is a good sign for the future, and we can't wait to get our hands on it.

He highlights that the destroyed wall on the left-hand side looked as though something had taken a huge bite out of it, and wasn't a good representation of how planks of wood would break.

We got our first look at Black Ops 6 at June 9's Call of Duty Direct, showing off new movement, round-based Zombies, and much more. Unsurprisingly, it got CoD fans very excited, and like many, I'm now counting down the days until I can get my hands on the game. 


In the meantime, there's still plenty of MW3 and Warzone content to come, but if you want to show off how eager you are for Treyarch's latest offering, then here's how to get your hands on some free Black Ops 6 cosmetics. 


I'd jump at free cosmetics too. Image via Activision


To get your free Black Ops 6 cosmetics, simply: 



Go to the official Call of Duty X account. 


Reply to the tweet embedded below with your Activision ID and the hashtag "#BlackOps6"





The cosmetics will then be added to your account automatically, so you don't need to worry about going to your Activision account to unlock them. Be fast though, as you only have until 12 pm PT / 3 pm ET / 8 pm BST to do get them before they're gone for good.

There's always been something very tactile, very tangible about the Luigi's Mansion experience. It comes mostly, we guess, from how this most terrified of heroes chooses to tip-toe and panic-run around levels. He moves differently, is more animated and purposeful than your usual game protagonist, and the world around him is designed to suit this more methodical and careful style.

It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing the Destiny franchise since the first game's alpha. I have fond memories of loading that early version up and blasting through everything it had to offer multiple times. Ever since, I've been hooked on this universe that, while not always giving me exactly what I wanted, was a space where I could live out a few sci-fi fantasies and explore an ever-evolving world spread across multiple planets. 


When Destiny 2: The Final Shape was finally released, it took me back to some of the best times I've had with the series and the community at large. Though, this might not be for the reasons you'd think. You see, this expansion had one of the biggest and error-filled launches I've seen in all the time I've been playing Destiny 2, let alone the entire series. 


But that's okay be…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2 Episode Echoes is the first ever Episode to hit the game and will be a landmark moment for fans as they jump in to explore the new narrative that'll be the standard for Year 10. However, before you can play, there's going to be some server downtime. 


No Destiny 2 update goes live without at least a little server maintenance and downtime. It's just a part of the game because it's always online, and developer Bungie needs some way to be able to add new files to it without players getting in the way. You won't be able to play during this downtime, but it should be short if Bungie's notes are to be believed. I wouldn't hold my breath, though, because the launch of The Final Shape wasn't exactly smooth. 


When does the server downtime for Destiny 2 Episode Echoes start and end?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were plenty of hype-worthy trailers to come out of the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, such as the reveals for Doom: The Dark Ages and Gears of War: E-Day. One trailer that seems to have elicited almost nothing but complaints, however, was the reveal for BioWare's next Dragon Age game, now titled Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which has accrued approximately 198,000 dislikes on YouTube compared to 35,000 likes.


As for why fans have reacted so negatively to the reveal, it appears to stem from the trailer's tone. Despite Dragon Age being a dark fantasy series, this cinematic trailer is anything but dark, going for a more comical and humourous take on its rundown of Veilguard's cast of characters. It feels more like something you'd see in a Borderlands game or an announcement for a new her…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year, Call of Duty fans spend months complaining about the fact that Ranked Play hasn't launched with the game. While we don't know for certain when it will be released in Black Ops 6, eagle-eyed CoD fans have already spotted it. 


During the UI reveal at Call of Duty Direct, well-known leaker BobNetworkUK highlighted an image taken from the screen that shows Black Ops 6's main menu. In it, alongside multiplayer and Zombies, is a button for Ranked Play. 


Of course, this doesn't mean that the mode will be live at launch, but the fact that they've baked it into the main menu from the start suggests it may be coming earlier than usual. 




The release window of Ranked Play has been a real source of frustration among CoD fans, who have complained that waiting three months, or sometimes even longer, for the mode is far too long. MW3's competitive playlist dropped in January 2024, while players had to wait until February 2023 for MW2's version. 


Ranked Play allows players to test their skills against opponents in curated maps and modes, based on what the professional players compete on in the Call of Duty League. Players are given a rank to demonstrate their ability and earn Skill Rating by winning matches. At the end of each season, players are awarded cosmetic items based on their performance. 


With the mode spotted in early builds of the game, fans are hopeful that we'll see Ranked Play in Season 1 of Black Ops 6, which usually drops a month after the game's launch. This would allow players to jump in while the game's population is at a high, and would likely see a second influx of competitors when the Christmas rush happens. 


Of course, nothing is confirmed just yet, so we'll just have to wait for Treyarch to provide some confirmation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italy's solution to IPTV piracy is already operating beyond the limits of its design. Piracy Shield launched in February under new law that compels all 300+ of the country's ISPs to block pirate streaming services. It now transpires that Italy's blocking system was only designed to accommodate 70 ISPs and now times out under the strain. By end of 2024, Piracy Shield Phase 2 will make its debut.

Nintendo has updated its Switch firmware to Version 18.1.0. As you might have already noticed, this one is a little bit different.
It's tied to the previous announcement in May about the Switch's discontinuation of 'X' (formerly Twitter). It means Switch users will no longer be able to post screenshots of videos to X from the system's album. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is also impacted and the option to link 'X' has now been removed as well as the ability to send friend requests to social media users.

The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anime Defenders offers quite a few interesting units to unlock, from Elf Wizardess to Warrior Princess. However, one Mythic has been gaining some traction, which is none other than the Donut Master. Find out how to unlock it in Roblox's Anime Defenders. 


How to get Donut Master evolution in Anime Defenders


Embarking on the journey to the Donut Master begins with obtaining the Donut Warrior Mythic in the Limited Banners. This unit is a rare find, with a mere .25 percent chance of acquisition. Brace yourself for a slow but steady challenge that will likely require a significant amount of Gems to overcome. You can earn these Gems by completing quests, using codes, or through the AFK Zone.

Once you've managed to unlock the Donut Warrior, the next step is to evolve it into Anime Defenders' Donut Master. This evolution requires three Donuts of Prosperity, which can be crafted using specific materials. The recipe for these Donuts is as follows:



4 Star Rifts (Blue)


4 Star Rifts (Red)


11 Star Rifts (Yellow)


1 Star Rift (Rainbow)


4 Star Rifts (Purple)



Star Rifts can be earned from the Challenges section. For example, Mob City's The Mentor's Legacy can drop Yellow, Blue, Red, and Rainbow Star Rifts. Check out this area to see which ones are available, as they will change over time.


There's also a cost of 9,000 Gold to craft a Donut of Prosperity. You can get Gold in Anime Defenders by completing quests, challenges, and selling units. After you've acquired three Donuts of Prosperity, head over to the Evolving area to exchange them, along with your Donut Warrior Mythic.

When you've successfully unlocked the Donut Master in Anime Defenders, you'll gain access to a unit that can unleash devastating damage upon your enemies. The Donut Master also excels in support roles, ensuring your longevity on the battlefield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, shown at Xbox's Summer Game Fest showcase this week, players are being treated to a few premium goodies right now for preordering. But perhaps more importantly, a much-requested feature has finally arrived: pets. 


Let's take a look at how to get your own dog - and I will not be calling it anything other than a "dog" - right now.


How to get the dog pet in Diablo 4


First, head to Kyovashad and make your way to the quest icon shown below to find a dog, speak with the dog, and become friends with the dog:


Screenshot by Destructoid


That's uh, kind of it, actually! There's no grand quest or anything, just a dog standing there waiting for you to come along and guide it out of the frozen streets of Kyovashad. You can equip your new pal by using the Wardrobe, going to the Pets tab, and selecting "Confirm Look." You can also pet the dog by using the "Hello" emote near it. Everybody loves to pet the dog these days.


The other three pets are locked behind a Vessel of Hatred pre-order, including a differently-colored dog and two not-so-big cats. The promise of pets being included in future Season Passes has me unreasonably excited.


Pets have been a pretty fan-requested feature for some time now, since in Diablo 3 they were invaluable for automatically gathering gold and resources as you adventure. They'll do much the same in Diablo 4, saving you just a little bit of extra running around as you slaughter foes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typically, having an enemy in real life or a video game sounds like a dreadful experience, especially if your game involves combat. Even in BitLife, enemies can get in the way of your character's everyday living. However, there are some benefits, especially if you're attempting to complete a scavenger hunt, achievement, or weekly challenge.


How to make someone your enemy in BitLife


There are two ways to make someone your enemy in BitLife: wait for them to declare you as their enemy or force their status to enemy in your relationships menu. If you have low friendship stats with someone, they may randomly decide you're their enemy after you age up. Otherwise, you can manually change it to make someone your enemy quickly. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Regardless of your method, you need to befriend someone first before turning them into your enemy. You can randomly encounter people as you age or befriend people at school and work. If your character is a child or teenager, school is your best bet. Alternatively, adult BitLife characters can enrol into university or pursue a full-time job and befriend their co-worker before turning them into their enemy.


Once someone declares you their enemy or you change your friend's status, your relationship will drain to zero instantly. Over time, they may start rumors or insult you, and they're more likely to retaliate with violence if you do either of these to them. 


Similarly, if you already have an enemy and want to befriend them again, you can change their status through the relationships menu. You'll have to work to improve your stats first, though.


For the most part, having an enemy doesn't benefit you unless you're completing a challenge or achievement. However, if your BitLife character thrives off having enemies and hurting others, this will certainly help with the immersion. Just be careful, as some NPCs can be ruthless and end your run if you say something they don't like.

In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

        <updated>2024-06-10T20:23:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently took a look at three different missions from developer Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft's upcoming open-world adventure title Stars Wars Outlaws. It feels like Star Wars is getting a ton of game releases lately, which while good as a whole, has also led to a few missing the mark.  Thankfully, it looks like Star Wars Outlaws is staying true to the Star Wars universe, and I'm excited to explore it.




In Star Wars Outlaws, players will adventure to various planets in the Star Wars universe, each one with unique gameplay elements and environments to explore. Throughout the three missions I saw many elements that have become staples all things Star Wars front and center in Outlaws. From zipping across the desert-like planet of Tatooine on a speeder to walking around a bustling cantina trying to get a meeting with a Hutt cartel.


In one mission, players engage in a dogfight in space while piloting a ship called the Trailblazer with the nearby planet looming in the background. The space combat seemed very similar to that of Star Wars: Squadrons, which isn't a bad thing. Dodging asteroids and space debris while flying around and dealing with enemies is always a good time, and it looks like the systems for doing so are a big part of Star Wars Outlaws rather than just an added sub-feature.


An important aspect of Star Wars Outlaws is going to be the story. The premise is solid, but I'm still looking forward to the opportunity to dive into the massive open-world and explore the side quests and off-the-beaten path areas of Outlaws. But after seeing a few gameplay missions, it looks as though Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft are going in the right direction with the world design and level of immersion that very important to a Star Wars game.


Star Wars Outlaws is set to release on August 30 on PC Ubisoft+ Premium, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed, the next RPG from those famed RPG creators at Obsidian, got another trailer during the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase this weekend. The new footage confirmed it's coming this year, but Avowed had a full release date revealed elsewhere before it was quickly removed.


As spotted by Wario64 on X, the Avowed story trailer blog page on the official Obsidian site revealed a release date of November 12, 2024. But like the Troxler effect, not long after eyes were cast upon the date, it disappeared from the blog post entirely. 




The date came as part of a short quote provided by the game director, Carrie Patel. Today, the quote reads: 


"The last few months at Obsidian Entertainment have been fast-paced and exciting. Since we saw you at the Xbox Developer Direct this past January, we’ve been busy with Avowed getting it ready."


Using the cosmic powers of the Wayback Machine, I was able to confirm the release date on the pre-edited page. Originally, the quote continued to say, "for release on November 12, 2024." And then it was gone.

Avowed got a November release date for a short while, at least


There's no need to queue up that X-Files music; the reveal may have likely been for a target date, but something changed. I recall a year where every other month felt like it had a game delay announcement or two. It could have been altered, whether due to a delay or something else. We can't really know for sure. 


For the most part, Obsidian is still targeting 2024 for Avowed. The exact month and day may still be up to the fates, but the year hasn't been changed yet. We may see the game around the fall regardless, nestled snuggly with others like Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred and Life is Strange: Double Exposure.

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.

Following a live-action teaser trailer, the studio revealed its next city-builder has a broad release window for some time in 2025. 




The Anno franchise is a series of city-builders taking place during various historical periods, with the previous entry, Anno 1800, set during the Industrial Era. Anno 117: Pax Romana is here to focus on Ancient Rome, where you'll play as a Roman Governor during the year 117. For the first time in the series' history, you'll also be able to choose your starting province, allowing you to challenge yourself by trying a few locations.


As of now, no further details regarding its release date are available. The trailer and follow-up announcement revealed its launch date for some time next year, but the month and day are currently unknown.


Anno 117: Pax Romana will launch on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games storefront.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Ubisoft Forward Stream, the company has again assured us that their remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time still exists. Except it’s coming in 2026. They told us this during an extremely brief nothing of a teaser.


Considering this is the series’ 35th anniversary and they’re making a big deal of it, they probably wanted the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake to hit this year, but things don’t sound like they’re going that well with a change of developers back in 2022. I suppose with nothing else to tell us, they showed us a candle burning in reverse before revealing a pretty far-off date. That’s far enough away for me to forget that it exists.




Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time first came out in 2003 and brought new excitement to the franchise started by Jordan Mechner back in 1989. Since then, new entries in the series have been pretty frequent, but arguably, none have really been able to achieve the same popularity.


That’s not for lack of trying. This year saw Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown which released to critical acclaim. The Rogue Prince of Persia is currently in early access and is being handled by the devs of one of the best Roguelite platformers, Dead Cells. Even without the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, it’s a pretty great year for the series.


Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will be coming in 2026.

Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 
Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 
Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below: 


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown hit PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC back in January, and it's one of our favorite games of the year. Read why in Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here. After that, check out these four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the Metroidvania genre right, and then watch our guide on how to beat the game's hardest platforming challenge.

But if you wanted to play it soon...bad news. It won’t be out until sometime in 2026.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time reemerged during Ubisoft's Forward event, but only slightly. Basically, Ubisoft confirmed the game is still in development, but it won't be releasing until 2026.
The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. 
The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. 


If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. 


Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about it by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

After an extended period when new users required an invite code, Bluesky opened its doors up to anyone who fancied registering earlier this year. You may be toying with the idea of signing up, if you haven't migrated already, or perhaps you're just hedging your bets with preparatory accounts on Threads, Mastodon, and the like, should The Website Formerly Known As Twitter disappear one day.

The latest UK Charts are in and, well, it seems the status quo has been restored with both Hogwarts Legacy and EA Sports FC 24 taking the top two spots.
This means, of course, that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has slipped down to position three after its launch on 23rd May 2024. Don't fret though, third place is still a mighty fine achievement and we suspect we'll continue to see Paper Mario chilling out in the top ten for quite some time.

During a recent episode of the Kiwi Talkz podcast, Stephen Hughes, assistant voice director for Metroid Dread and the voice of the Chozo character Quiet Robe, spoke about the challenges in adapting a completely new language for the game.
According to Hughes, developer MercurySteam wanted the language to flow when recording the lines for the cutscenes. As such, they based it on the syntax of English, meaning the order of words would closely follow that of the English language. This allowed Hughes to recognise where certain words were placed when compared to his native language, thus allowing him to convey subtleties and nuance when recording his lines.

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.

Following on from the release of Grounded and Pentiment on the Switch, Spencer reiterated Xbox's plan to release more of its catalogue on other platforms. Now, you might be thinking "Well yes, we know this", but it's interesting that he's being so open about the plan now compared to his relative caginess some months back.

Yes, the game had been leaked weeks in advance of its official E3 announcement, but this show had it all. Miyamoto was there. He had a replica gun from the game. He walked out of a corridor filled with dry ice. What more could you want? Well, as it turns out, Nintendo wanted less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

When the infamous 'Willy's Chocolate Experience' event went viral earlier this year, you would think that organisers would learn from its mistakes and strive to avoid similar mishaps.
Unfortunately, it looks like the video game industry now has its own 'Willy Wonka' expo to call its own with the 'Pokeverse' fan convention over in Mandaluyong, Manila in the Phillippines. As highlighted by Eurogamer, an attendee by the name of BintuRita has compiled her own experience of the event on social media, relaying an odyssey of misfortune, disappointment, and flat-out ineptitude on the part of the organisers.

Among the wreckage, a release date for Tactical Breach Wizards, the funny strategy game in which you play a ragtag crew of uniformed magic-zappers clearing enemies in confined spaces. It's not XCOM, but it is XCOM-ing soon. That's about as good a joke as I can muster on a Monday morning. Don't worry, there are funnier ones in the trailer below.

While it was formally revealed for PC and Xbox around a year ago, developer Jump Over the Age and publisher Fellow Traveller popped up at this weekend's PC Gaming Show to announce that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will also launch on the Switch. What's more, it's been given a release window of early 2025.
If the title hasn't given it away already, this is a follow-up to 2022's excellent tabletop-inspired RPG Citizen Sleeper. Like its predecessor, Starward Vector will see you playing as an android (Sleeper) on the run from the company that made you. You'll have to commandeer a ship, build up a crew and carry out as many tasks as possible before your decaying body halts your progress. A nice, stress-free experience, then...

Atari and WayForward have revealed a new trailer for the upcoming stealth Metroidvania Yars Rising, launching on Nintendo Switch later this year.
It gives us a nice little glimpse at some of the game's core mechanics, including the ability to upgrade protagonist Emi Kimura's powers, hacking into various systems to partake in Yars' Revenge-inspired minigames, huge boss encounters, and of course, sneaky stealth gameplay.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

Witch Beam, the Brisbane-based dev team behind BAFTA-winning indie hit Unpacking, has revealed that its next project — a musical puzzler by the name of Tempopo — is coming to Switch sometime in 2024.
With Cult Games on publishing duties, the initial trailer debuted in the recent PC Gaming Show, but you can check out the "Director's Cut" of it above. We recommend watching the whole thing, as the gameplay clips at the end do a better job of explaining the chill vibes and puzzle gameplay than the tone-setting opening.

Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number. 
Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is "33" and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these "Expeditioners" are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.


The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and sports slick-looking turn-based action. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is coming in 2025 to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including launching day one on Game Pass), and PC.]]></summary>

With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.
Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.

After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year.

I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 
There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting. From modern and near-future settings to distant-future adventures in space, the franchise has explored the reaches of theoretical conflicts. However, the series may well be at its best when focusing on historical time periods and events, as has largely been the case with Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series.

And is also quite informative about the moment-to-moment of the game. The video is framed as the memoir of a paunchy retired champion, Humphry, who once mentored a young heroine I presume will be the game's main character, though it's ambiguous. She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-lost reboot of Perfect Dark made its grand return during today's Xbox Games Showcase. First announced in 2020 at The Game Awards, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic. 
The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.


Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. It is coming to Xbox Series X/S, but it still has no release window.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have published the very first trailer for EA and BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, formerly known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, at their summer Xbox Game Showcase. It accompanies the first details of this "immersive single player RPG" - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - "where you become the leader others believe in". Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Showcase gave us a new look at Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, an action/role-playing game all about taking down a host of ancient gods. The game is in its final days of development from A44 Games, the same studio that released Ashen.
The trailer shows off the action in an open world that recalls titles like God of War and Elden Ring. The team has previously said that the action draws at least some inspiration from Soulslike games.
With today’s announcement, we know we won’t have long to wait until the game is available to try for ourselves, with a release date of July 18 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
Check out the new release date announcement trailer below for a glimpse of the action.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fable will launch sometime next year, developer Playground Games has revealed. It did so during today's Xbox Games Showcase with a new trailer that features quick snippets of gameplay starring our heroine. 
In the trailer, we see our hero waltzing through a large medieval town while a narrator discusses an old threat returning to the world. Our hero wants to save Albion, and to do so, she needs to enlist the help of Humphry, who is the one narrarating the trailer. 
While there appears to be gameplay in the trailer, there's no U.I. and no combat – it's mostly just our hero protagonist walking and running through various fantastical locations. We do see some glimpses of combat, but it looks cinematic so it's hard to tell if it's actual combat gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fable gameplay trailer below: 


"What does it mean to be a hero," the trailer's description reads. "Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion's very existence." 
Microsoft revealed Fable was coming back in 2020, with a reveal trailer from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. We then got our next look at the game with a more narrative-focused trailer starring Richard Ayoade last year, and today's new trailer is our first look at the game since then. 
Fable launches on Xbox Series X/S (and presumably PC) in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for a while that Starfield was getting its first expansion later this year, but tonight's Xbox Games Showcase gave us its first trailer. My main takeaway? That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they're on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

Other details, like whether series creator Hideo Kojima is involved in any way (unlikely) and a release date, are still unknown. But we're still excited to commence the virtuous mission again, hopefully soon.]]></summary>

I reviewed State Of Decay the first and thought it was a cool scrappy underdog next to larger zombie-botherers such as Left 4 Dead or DayZ. State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.
The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Doom: The Dark Ages, the third installment in developer id Software's modern Doom reboot. And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. 
Fret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. 
Check it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. 
Id Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. 
Interestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Chef Brigade developer Trinket Studios has unveiled its next project, Battle Suit Aces. Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.
Revealed during the Future of Play Direct players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.


The game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a "star-consuming threat." 
Battle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date. You can read our review of Battle Chef Brigade here.]]></summary>

Both the hero shooter genre and mainstream Marvel media are currently in interesting places. Overwatch, the most prominent hero shooter of last decade, has experienced a sharp downtown since the late 2019 announcement of its sequel, while the Marvel Cinematic Universe, once a surefire cash cow, has seen a wider range of results since its 2019 culmination with Avengers: Endgame. Marvel Rivals exists at the intersection of these two categories, and my hands-on session gave me hope that it will be able to capture the magic of both of these genre's glory days.

Sonic X Shadow Generations brings one of the most well-liked Sonic games of the last decade and a half forward to modern consoles. What was essentially a "greatest hits" compilation of remade levels from throughout Sonic's history to serve as a celebration of the Blue Blur's 20th anniversary is being remastered for current technology, but that's not all: As part of the package, players can engage in a standalone campaign starring Shadow. I went hands-on with two stages of each character to see how the anticipated definitive edition of the 2011 title is coming along.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel. 
Set in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. 
Check it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: 


From Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. 
"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world," studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. "This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future." 
Here are some screenshots from the game: 

Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dustborn, the narrative action road trip game developed by Red Thread Games and published by Quantic Dream, received a new trailer during today’s Future Games Show. We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.
Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below. 


If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17. Dustborn launches on August 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silver Lining Studio, the developer of Behind The Frame, has revealed its next game, The Star Named EOS, will launch next month. More specifically, the narrative-driven photography-based puzzle game will launch on July 23 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. 
Silver Lining revealed this during today's Wholesome Direct, during which it also showcased some new gameplay from The Star Named EOS. In the gameplay trailer, we see more of this game's beautiful hand-drawn world, unique puzzles solved through photography, and more. 
Check it out for yourself in The Star Named EOS release date trailer below: 


You might recognize someone in the trailer, too, as the main character's mother is voiced by Suzie Yeung, who voices Yuffie in Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The Japanese dub features the voice of Aoi Yūki, who has voiced characters in Persona 5, Genshin Impact, and more, and the Chinese voice-over is performed by Shandy Ma, who has appeared in more than 20,000 commercials and TV shows. 
"The Star Named EOS is a story-driven puzzle game centered on a love for photography and the pursuit of memory," a press release reads. "As a child, Dei regularly received letters from his mother when she was traveling, each of which came enclosed with a memorable snapshot of the location she was visiting. But one day, Dei notices something peculiar about one of the photographs she left behind, putting everything he believes to the test. Now, guided by his mother's voice deep within himself, it's time for Dei to set out on his own to learn the truth about his family and confront the echoes of the past." 
Here are some additional screenshots from The Star Named EOS: 

The Star Named EOS hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on July 23. If you're curious about the game, you can download its Steam demo right now.

When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, "yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run." So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-remakers-night-dive-are-remastering-the-thing"/>
        <updated>2024-06-08T00:51:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.

Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle. It is called the Hexahedron, and its interior constitutes a “large, continuous puzzle cluster” that the player will navigate. As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UFO 50 is a collection of fictional retro games designed as if they were made for a non-existent games console 40 years ago, but in reality have been developed as brand new titles for an upcoming collection from indie devs including Spelunky creator Derek Yu. With the ambitious project nearing a decade in its own development, though, those games have now taken on their own real history in addition to their made-up one. Those histories will meet this September, when UFO 50 finally sees the light of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

Ah, to return to a simpler time, where kids tripped each other up in the school hallways to steal toys , before Pokémon cards came along and everyone leveled up to stabbings. Sorry, Petal Runner devs, for opening a news article about your lovely wholesome game talking about stabbings. This gorgeous, fuschia-splashed, slice-of-life RPG is, if anything, the antidote to stabbings. In terms of game fatigue, anyway. It won’t cure tetanus, at least I don’t think so.

Then Wanderstop started to get rather bleak, and I finally stopped pinching myself. See for yourself.

I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.

The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

Yet, when the major Hollywood studios teamed up with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, to obtain a strict, immediate injunction against a site considered a global piracy threat, early non-compliance wasn't harshly punished. Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my eternal quest to describe games concisely enough that you don’t feel robbed of time you could have just watched a trailer with, I am compelled to use many of the same words and word combinations ad nauseam. So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.

It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800.

Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of PowerWash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taipei’s annual Computex event is always a big, circled, triple-underlined mark in the PC gaming hardware calendar. Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Příští vydání Blenderu 4.2 přechází s vydáním beta verze do fáze feature freeze a už se jen bude ladit kvalita kódu. Můžeme se tak podívat na novinky, které opět stojí za to. Nově běží s GPU akcelerací compositing pro fine rendery (výsledek by měl být prakticky stejný pro CPU i GPU cestu). Render compositor je přepsán, jeho běh je nyní až několikanásobně rychlejší. Rychleji probíhají i undo operace.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fucksweeper is a difficult game to play in shared accommodation, a very difficult game to play in the crowded airport lounge I'm currently sitting in, and an incredibly difficult game to play on the airplane I will shortly be boarding. What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the climatic end to a decade-long saga in Endwalker, anticipation is high for Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail. I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you'll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!
First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!
