Remember the Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser? In the previous update, it was revealed he had been jailed for over three years and fined close to $15 million for his involvement in Team Xecutor - a business that allowed Switch owners to hack their systems and play pirated games.
In an update, the Canadian resident - who was 51 at the time of being sentenced - has now been released early from America's federal prison, partly due to a good behaviour bond, and will return to Canada.

I’d argue that Castlevania has never really found its footing in 3D. Fans of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow might be raising their eyebrows right now, but I found that game as flavorful as dry bread made of drywall shavings.

The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

HoYoverse's upcoming game Honkai: Star Rail is picking up a lot of speed heading into launch. The studio recently confirmed that it's garnered 10 million pre-registrations for Honkai: Star Rail ahead of release later this month.
This is the latest game from HoYoverse (also known as miHoYo), the makers of Genshin Impact and, before that, Honkai Impact 3rd. Considering the wild popularity of Genshin and the Honkai name attached, it's not terribly surprising that Star Rail is garnering numbers. Still, 10 million is a lot of players.

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization. The result is a distinctive “reverse city builder” that weaves compelling mechanics together, creating an enjoyable experience with a good message.

After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

April 17, 2023
The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

In Resident Evil 4 Remake, the Plagas has turned rural Spain into a treacherous landscape, and Leon has to claw through monsters and crazed villagers to save the president's daughter. Although he starts off with just a pistol, he gains access to several more guns which he uses against frightening foes.
Collecting all the weapons is fun, and gamers who do so are rewarded with the Gun Fanatic Trophy/Achievement. Players wondering how to get the Gun Fanatic Trophy/Achievement in Resident Evil 4 Remake may be disappointed to discover that it's impossible to earn it in a single playthrough, though Leon's journey is one worth experiencing more than once.

The latest UK boxed charts are now in, giving us an idea of what's going on in the world of physical game sales. The answer this week: nothing new, really.
After a slightly quieter week for Nintendo after the Easter break, this week's standing does see a few more titles from the Big N breaking into the charts. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has overtaken the competition, moving up two places and currently sitting in second, while Super Mario Odyssey continues to sell well thanks to the release of the new Switch bundle and the Mario Movie, this time landing in fifth place.

The game launches on PC and Mac on May 18 and will come to PlayStation consoles and PS VR2 at a later date. Firmament was initially funded via Kickstarter and was first teased way back in March 2018. It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creative director is moving on to new ventures
Mark Healey, a co-founder of Media Molecule who's been with the company for 17 years, has announced his departure from the studio.
Healey co-founded Media Molecule alongside Alex Evans, David Smith, and Kareem Ettouney in 2006. Now, the developer shared on social media that it's time for him to "fly the nest" and head to new ventures.
https://twitter.com/marcoshealey/status/1647895186452652032
"From LittleBigPlanet to Dreams and beyond - proud to have played my part and lucky to have jammed with some truly brilliant people - and such a wonderfully talented Community which I will continue to be a fan of," Healey said. "But a strong cosmic breeze is pulling me and my pirate heart is awakened, I'm not getting any younger so am going to indulge myself in the winds of my various curiosities for a while and see where they take me.
"So here's to new beginnings, following one’s heart and exploring the unknown - Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum - I'm off on a Pirate adventure! (One that involves making games that is)."
Dreaming of new horizons
Healey acted as creative director on big games like Media Molecule's LittleBigPlanet and the 2020 game creation tool Dreams. And his departure arrives not long after the studio announced it would be ending live service support for Dreams this coming September.
Hopefully, this isn't an indication of turbulent times at Media Molecule. Dreams is an incredible piece of software that felt like it was waiting for its big breakout moment; I've played tons of wild, interesting stuff on it. And in a world where user-generated content is a bit of a buzzword, you'd hope Media Molecule would have a prominent place in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conserve that precious SSD space
A new listing for Capcom's upcoming fist-thrower Street Fighter 6 appears to show that the new sequel will support partitioned download, allowing budding World Warriors to pick and choose which modes they wish to install on their PlayStation, Xbox, or PC hardware.
The Microsoft Store listing sees Street Fighter 6 divided into three separate downloads — including the core "Street Fighter 6" file, which is the online portion featured in the recent betas, "Fighting Ground", which is likely most of the single-player modes, and then the "World Tour" story mode. This would suggest that once players have had their fill of single-player content, then they can delete that part of the game to conserve space, while still retaining all of the online modes.
If so, then this represents just one more way that Capcom is attempting to redefine the Street Fighter experience with the highly anticipated sequel. SF6 already boasts myriad control methods, as well as exciting new modes, a fully overhauled single-player experience, and all manner of small tweaks to elements such as ranking, matchmaking, online connectivity, mini-games and side activities, and other content to ensure that the new title will deliver one of the most fully-featured SF experiences ever.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Capcom will be holding a dedicated Street Fighter Showcase live stream this Thursday, promising more news and announcements. In the meantime, be sure to check out our previous reports on the 50 things I loved in the beta, my impressions on the sequel so far, as well as suggestions on the 10 World Warriors who would fit right into the new title as post-launch DLC.

ININ Games is bringing two Taito all-timers to Switch in the form of RayStorm X RayCrisis HD Collection. Confirmed for a western release last year by the publisher, an eShop listing for 30th June 2023 has appeared, suggesting that we won't have to wait too long to get our hands on this classic bundle.
RayStorm and RayCrisis (also known as RayCrisis: Series Termination) are both related to Taito's 1994 shmup RayForce — RayStorm takes place in an alternate universe, while RayCrisis is a prequel. Rather than their predecessor's pixel art visuals, both games use a 3D polygonal style. And with this HD collection being handled from the talented team at M2, we're sure this is another must-have package for shmup fans on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. 
But actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced it’s acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game company behind Angry Birds.
A press release states that Sega will absorb the entirety of Rovio’s outstanding shares and options (€706 million in total) in what’s being labeled as a “friendly takeover” since Rovio’s board of directors agree to and support the acquisition terms. This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. 
“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”
“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”
Rovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans have likely spent endless seasons in the comfort of Stardew Valley, and now the chill life sim is getting even bigger. Stardew Valley’s creator Eric Barone (otherwise known as ConcernedApe) is “taking a break” from working on his highly-anticipated Haunted Chocolatier. Barone will instead work on Stardew Valley’s upcoming 1.6 update, which focuses on improvements for modders, alongside some new content as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery Pokemon is related to Terapagos
Earlier this year, we learned that Pokemon Scarlet & Violet would be getting two DLC drops spread across 2023, similar to the last generation. "The Teal Mask" arrives in the fall and "The Indigo Disk" is coming in the winter; since their initial reveal, we haven't learned much info about the DLC: until recently.
The new generation of the anime (sans Ash) teased another upcoming Pokemon, and it looked to be directly related to (or perhaps an early/chibi form of) Terapagos. Well, the Pokemon Company straight-up confirmed it in a tweet today.
Here's a quick recap of all the info we have so far:
"A newly discovered Pokemon appears in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero for Pokemon Scarlet or Pokemon Violet! Its splendid aura is reminiscent of the Legendary Pokemon Terapagos, but this Pokemon’s name and true nature are shrouded in mystery. This Pokemon is small in stature and not particularly strong, but when push comes to shove, it can crystallize the energy in its body to form a protective shield. Apparently, it can also assume a dormant state when it feels that its life is in danger by pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and making itself look like a jewel."

So we got a full official image of the Pokemon beyond the anime, and we know it's related to Terapagos (one of the new DLC 'mons). It's something! It could be the Mew to the Terapagos' Mewtwo, or it could be unrelated and simply "reminiscent" of the DLC turtle (or something else entirely, as Pokemon has myriad ways to create new 'Dex entries or accommodate for forms). Either way, it's nice to see another 'mon confirmed that'll eventually be added to the 'Dex far ahead of the fall.

Microsoft’s DirectStorage has only so far only found support in the ho-hum Forspoken, and PCIe 5.0 SSDs still aren’t widely available despite the first compatible CPUs and motherboards launching in 2021.
However, the latter are coming soon, and I’ve been testing out an engineering sample of the Crucial T700 to see how PCIe 5.0 – also known as PCIe Gen5 – drives could perform in an honest-to-goodness gaming PC. The short version: with maximum read and write speeds that tower over the current generation’s best SSDs, albeit with less impact on game load times than such explosive pace would suggest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The true Battle of Hyrule.
With a little under four weeks remaining until the worldwide launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, it's still a little early to debate whether or not the game itself will be superior to its predecessor, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You know, seeing as nobody's played it yet, an' all.
We here at Nintendo Life love a good debate, though — our video team just recently ranked every trailer for Tears of the Kingdom, be sure to check out the video and other poll at the bottom of the article — and since Nintendo has now graced us with the third and final trailer for the upcoming sequel, we thought it would be fun to find out whether our lovely community prefers the latest glimpse at Tears of the Kingdom, or its counterpart, the 2017 Nintendo Switch Presentation trailer for Breath of the Wild. The latter is known in some circles as The Best Trailer Ever Made™, but TOTK's final one is a bit tasty, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It'll be "easier to mod" after 1.6
It's hard to believe that Stardew Valley came out in early 2016: but no matter how many times I go through the process of recalling when it actually came out, I'm still shocked by it. It feels like such a big part of the overall gaming landscape and the successful indie narrative; and I still play it yearly with a fairly sizable group of people. And it's still going, too! Stardew boss Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone tweeted out an update on Stardew Valley version 1.6, and it's still going ahead as planned (albeit with their next project on pause for a bit).
Here's the full update from ConcernedApe themselves (as a reminder, Haunted Chocolatier is the next game from ConcernedApe, and has been teased periodically since late 2021):
"There is going to be a Stardew 1.6 update. It's mostly changes for modders (which will make it easier & more powerful to mod). But there is also new game content, albeit much less than 1.5. I'm taking a break from Haunted Chocolatier to work on this at the moment. Then back to HC."

Responding to a fan, we got one more tidbit about what 1.6 will entail:
"...The new update will have some more dialogues. [W]orking on it as we speak!"

They also doled out a bit more info on Haunted Chocolatier:
"The town is on the water and there are docks."

It really showcases just how big the fanbase is for ConcernedApe when that simple statement causes a speculative feeding frenzy. I mean, even if it just has a small amount of gameplay content, I'll be fully replaying it!
My guess is that ConcernedApe will never truly shake the siren's song of Stardew: and will do small updates here and there indefinitely. If that ends up being the case, you love to see it.

In a strange update that some are speculating was an accident, Capcom has removed the Ray Tracing feature from the PC ports of the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. Furthermore, the Dolby Atmos feature was removed from Resident Evil 3.
The patch rolled out sometime over the weekend. This writer saw it and wondered internally what it was for. There were no patch notes included with it. Reports later came in of the feature removal.
Capcom has said nothing of the change, leading to much speculation. I did what you should never do and checked the Steam discussion forums and immediately regretted it. While there is a thread that demonstrates how you can revert to the previous patch and restore the feature, most of the comments were pure speculation, dumb jokes, or co…]]></summary>

By now, many of you will have likely seen The Super Mario Bros. Movie (and if you haven't yet, it's definitely at least worth checking out, even if we weren't overly hot on it).
One of the biggest points of conversation in the lead up to the movie's release was how the main protagonist, Mario himself, would sound with Hollywood star Chris Pratt provding the voice. Since we're all so used to Mario being voiced by the incredible Charles Martinett, the more, well... "normal" approach taken by Pratt definitely ruffled a few feathers in the Nintendo community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's a lot more than Six Golden Coins
Universal's smash-hit flick The Super Mario Bros Movie is now officially the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time, having bagged an incredible $677 million USD at the global box office in just its first two weeks of release.
The Illumination-produced feature, which stars Chris Pratt as the iconic Nintendo mascot, had already surpassed a $500 million box office by the midway point of last week, but has since gone on to record another amazing weekend, pushing the numbers up by over $100 million, surpassing Marvel's latest endeavor, Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, to become the highest-grossing film of 2023 so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNcTBXTk4I&ab_channel=Illumination
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros Movie has also topped the box office for both Warner Bros.' 2019 release, Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, as well as Universal's own 2016 feature, Warcraft, to officially become the biggest video game movie ever. And given that we are a mere two weeks into Mario & Co.'s box office busting, the number-crunchers are eagerly anticipating the possibility that the film may eventually hit the platinum prestige of a one billion dollar box office.
As I've noted before, the Hollywood bigwigs own the most easily turned of heads, and it would not be a surprise to see an absolute plethora of video game adaptations greenlit in the coming 10 years, to what, I'm sure, will be varying reward.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now showing at European and U.S. theatres. It will open in Japan April 28. You can check out our own CJ Andriessen's thoughts on the film in our review.

Now this was a difficult one to call, but it was Europe's grizzly zombie cover that came out on top with 47% of the vote. North America landed in second place with 27% and the Japanese box art closely followed with 26%.

I hope that this has been a fine week for you and that your locale is starting to see at least something in the way of finer weather as we push into spring.

I think I'm getting better, but some dogged symptoms still have the better of me. Here's hoping that I can mop it up this weekend.
Aside from that, little else to report, I hope that you all enjoyed this week's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer. That is not a game for me, but I'm very happy to see all y'all happy. We actually look to be heading into something of a very special summer, with Zelda, Str…]]></summary>

It's got turn-based tactical combat against rats with magic rifles in a steampunk world already in ruins. It's got the need to keep on moving, lest an approaching rat horde overwhelm you. It's got bunkers in which your party rests, de-stresses, and tools up before moving on.

Kind of a Fallouty, XCOMy, FTLy, Vermintidey mix, then - which together seems very cool. It's out now, and there's a demo.

There are few moments as blood-pumpingly dramatic in a Yakuza/Like a Dragon game as when someone rips their shirt off and unveils their tattoos. It is the peak of a fight, often reserved for special showdowns or the height of the story's arc.
Sega—for a reason I can't really discern at this moment—recently posted a compilation celebrating just that: the epic back tattoo reveal moments of Ryu Ga Gotoku's Like a Dragon series. From the original Yakuza games up through Like a Dragon, there are many. And they're all spectacular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pump up the Jam
This week's trip back to the golden age of gaming, guided by the retro-lovers over at Hamster Corporation, sees us take a look at the much lesser-known sequel to one of the most beloved coin-op classics of all time — Now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, its Namco's Dig Dug II!
Released to the arcade market in 1985, before later being ported to the Famicom platform, Dig Dug II features all of the sounds and visuals of the seminal 1982 original, but chooses to set the action on the surface, forgoing the mine-based gameplay of the original and somewhat removing both the "Dig" and the "Dug". Hero Taizo returns, once again armed with his trusty harpoon pump with which he must fend off iconic enemies including Pookas, and Fygars.
In addition, Taizo is now equipped with a jackhammer, and is able to partition areas of each stage to sink into the ocean, destroying all nearby enemies, and perhaps Taizo himself if the player is careless with their jackhammering activities. You can check out the cutesy action for yourself in the gameplay video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvPB1HOVXrA&ab_channel=ReplayBurners
While Namco should be congratulated for at least trying something a little different, Dig Dug II just doesn't have quite the same compelling nature of the original, with the top-down maze style a poor replacement for the original game's strategic tunneling system. The sequel would not receive an official home release outside of its native Japan, only appearing in the form of latter-day Namco compilations and retro re-releases. It's perfectly fine, of course, as is the case for almost all Namco classics, but simply cannot hold water when compared to its exceptionally well-designed forerunner.
Dig Dug II is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

That's the most important thing I have to say, that it makes for good virtuatourism.
Oh, and I suppose a free content arrived this week too, adding new side-missions, handy new combat abilities, and a new "rogue-lite" mode. The update, uh, apparently also added Denuvo, over a year after the game launched? Cool, cool.

For some, the Nintendo Switch can be an expensive investment. Once you've purchased the console itself, there are additional Joy-Con controllers, the Nintendo Switch Online membership, and, of course, first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey that almost never seem to go on sale, even years after their release.
Thankfully, there are some awesome games on this system that cost absolutely nothing to play and are most certainly worth your time and attention. Here are the 10 best free-to-play games on Nintendo Switch you can enjoy right now.

I had left weird abiogenesis idle clicker The Barnacle Goose Experiment running in the background for a few days, dithering a bit any time I stumbled back across the browser tab, until one day it hit me. I don't remember what it was, but one discovery was so strange and exciting that I then sat there for four hours, thinking "I'll go to bed when this result comes in", and then. Woof. I am now far too old to stay up past my bedtime playing video games, and am still tired. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have released so many 7-Star Tera Raids lately that they’ve started to blur together in my mind. With the debut of Typhlosion from Generation 2, that feeling has only intensified. Sure, it has some unique strategies you'll have to play around. But seeing a certain Pokemon wreak havoc again in the fight's emerging meta triggers my déjà vu. Of course, I’m getting a little ahead of myself.
For those just tuning in to what has become a biweekly feature, let’s give the usual rundown. No matter how you find 7-Star Typhlosion, it will always sport the Ghost Tera Type and the same moveset. You can only catch one Typhlosion per savefile, but you can continue to farm the fight while it lasts for rare goodies. To contend with this mo…]]></summary>

Looking back, Excitebike would have benefited from being released a couple years later. Originally on Famicom in 1984, it was still stuck in the arcade mindset. It was very strictly round-based, there was no real progression, and the best you could do was compete for best time, which wasn’t actually recorded on the game itself.
The most console-specific feature that it had was a track builder, which was definitely cool. However, on NES, you couldn’t actually save your track, which was far less cool. If you were on Famicom, you could actually save tracks using the Famicom Data Recorder, which would save your data to a cassette tape. That’s extremely cool to a retro geek like me. I mean, the Famicom was marketed as being a family-friendly microcomputer (Famicom being shorthan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new look for an evolving studio
Remedy Entertainment is updating its look. After over 20 years of sticking to the same logo, Remedy unveiled its new logo today.
The old Remedy logo, with a bullet in the letter R, was representative of the era of Max Payne, and a different kind of Remedy. But, as communications director Thomas Puha writes in the announcement, Remedy is evolving. And so its logo is evolving, too, to better reflect today's Remedy.
"The Remedy logo means a lot to us, but we know it also means a lot to you," Puha said. "Like the games we create at Remedy, we approached this process with great care, consideration and a lot of passion! We want to create memorable worlds, stories, and characters for you to experience through our games. We wanted our new logo to reflect how we constantly evolve and continue creating exciting games with the very best people. However, it’s all still one Remedy where courageous creativity thrives. We hope you like the new look."
The new logo, seen above, is an R with a bit of a mirrored, staggered look. It does remind me a bit of some of the visual effects from Control, which suits Remedy's lean into sci-fi storytelling over the years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyJvCq4HvQ4
A question of identity
It might seem like a little shift, but reading about this today did make me reflect on how Remedy has shifted over the years. The studio started out in 1995, with an eye-shaped logo that infamously prompted a standoff with LucasArts and led to the logo that stuck for two decades.
In the time since, Remedy went from May Payne to Alan Wake, then on to Quantum Break. And now, with the success of 2019's Control, the studio is planning several spin-offs, as well as a Max Payne remake compilation. There's even Alan Wake 2 due out this year, a launch target that Remedy reaffirms in today's news. The studio's certainly grown a lot, and now it's got a new look to go with it.
The post Remedy has a new company logo, for first time in over 20 years appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

In the 35+ years that The Simpsons has been on television — only 12 of those being years being Good — Captain Wacky and his family have taken a delightfully satirical stab at practically all forms of art, entertainment, and global services. From comic books to movies, cartoons to pop music, and even services such as Uber and esports in episodes that you haven't seen because you tuned out years ago.

We have a new trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the last one we'll see ahead of the game's launch next month. While it gave us some answers, we still have a boatload of new and old questions.
For a three, almost four-minute video, it's absolutely stuffed with things to talk about. Ganondorf has officially returned, there may be other forces at play, and theories about what's to come are being forged as we speak. So, we've gone beat-by-beat to piece apart some interesting tidbits we can glean from the video.

I’d be surprised if Victory Heat Rally didn’t catch your eye. It’s an intoxicatingly colorful and energetic-looking title. Based on the aesthetic from Sega Super Scaler racers like Power Drift and Rad Mobile, it’s a far cry from the mostly drab modern racing market. I’ve been following it for what feels like forever, but it’s taken me some time to get around to the demo.
Thankfully, Victory Heat Rally is more than just appearances. Without hyperbole, this is one of the most compelling racing titles I’ve played in a long time. It’s fast, vibrant, and deftly captures the attention-grabbing magic of old arcade titles. Just by following its development, I knew that Victory Heat Rally was going to be a worthwhile title, but I couldn’t imagine it would be this good.

Publisher Sega, in association with developer Relic Entertainment, has announced that wartime strategy sequel Company of Heroes 3 will be making its debut on PS5 and Xbox Series X on May 30, following on from its initial PC release in February of this year.
This will be the first time that the lauded strategy series will be made available on console platforms, with Relic promising a fully optimized experience for PlayStation and Xbox players. Company of Heroes 3 will feature a fully overhauled U.I. and control system designed especially for the console platforms, with in-game features such as Full Tactical Pause allowing players to masterfully control their troops in the thick of the action, unperturbed by the lack of mouse & keyboard control systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDfn-TFydEY&ab_channel=SEGA
Set against the backdrop of the North African campaign of World War II, Company of Heroes 3 offers up new solo and multiplayer game modes, as well as the new, sandbox-style, Italian campaign. Unfortunately, reviews were incredibly divisive for the ambitious new release, and while many praised the sequel's new control features and highly impressive destruction physics, some critics complained that the title didn't do enough to recreate the intensity of battle, with weak A.I. opposition and a casual approach to moment-to-moment warfare.
Fortunately, the community has been utilizing the feedback forum to discuss the title's issues with developers. So, hopefully, there will be time and opportunity to polish the game's rougher edges.
Company of Heroes 3 launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X May 30. It is available right now on PC.

Solo-developer Wegenbartho-Games has launched a Kickstarter for their murder mystery adventure, The Murder Hotel. The campaign runs until May 3, 2023 and is seeking €8,500.
This is kind of hilarious. The Murder Hotel is a murder mystery, but rather than figure out the murderer, I guess you already know: It’s some scissor-wielding demon. The demon won’t let you leave unless you pin their murders on the various guests. Like, they didn’t actually do it, but you have to come up with a super-plausible theory that “proves” that they did. So, you’re just deliberately accusing innocent people.
[caption id="attachment_373827" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Wegenbartho-Games[/caption]
You need to convince a demon council, so maybe there won’t be any real repercussions for these people you accuse. I choose to believe they’re just going to be sucked down into Hell. I’m feeling really malicious, so I want to just creatively screw some digital people over.
Beyond the concept being delectable, the campaign is pretty informative on where the project is and what planning has been done. It’s enough information to build confidence and outline all the plans.
The downside is that the plan is for The Murder Hotel to launch in December 2024. That’s a reasonable development period, but I want it now. There are stretch goals for more languages and another to have actual voice-over. I hate when people talk to me, so that’s not a must-have feature for me.
The Murder Hotel is slated for release on Switch and PC. The Kickstarter campaign runs until May 3, 2023 and is projected to release in December 2024.

Typhlosion is here in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and with it comes a corresponding 7-Star raid. Anyone who defeats Typhlosion will be able to catch it, so we caught it as we always do. Check out all its stats, abilities, and moves below.
If you need help unlocking this encounter, check out our guide here.
[gallery size="large" columns="2" ids="373732,373733"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Typhlosion loot list
Here’s everything I earned during my first clear of this battle. As a reminder, you can only catch Typhlosion once while the event is live. However, you can run the battle continuously for rewards.
Exp.Candy L x6
Exp.Candy XL x4
Calcium x5
Ghost Tera Shard x20
Ghost Tera Shard x10
TM114
Ability Patch X1
Star Piece x2
Exp.Candy L x6
Bottle Cap x1
Calcium x5
PP Up x1
Exp. Candy L x5
Mild Mint
Look at those Ghost Tera Shards, maybe I'll use them on Annihilape! TM114 (Shadow Ball) and the Ability Patch are only guaranteed to drop once, though more Ability Patches may appear if you continue to farm this encounter.
[gallery columns="4" ids="373734,373735,373736,373737"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Samurott moves and stats
Typhlosion sports the Ghost Tera Type, making it similar to Hisuian Typhlosion from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Like past events, it is level 100 and has its hidden ability Flash Fire. Here are its moves:
Eruption
Shadow Ball
Play Rough
Earthquake
Here are Samurott’s stats:
HP – 297
Attack - 204
Defense – 172
Sp. Atk – 279
Sp. Def – 206
Speed – 236
Also like past 7-Star encounters, Typhlosion will have the Mightiest Mark. This grants it the title of Typhlosion the Unrivaled.
Does the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Typhlosion count as a Paldean Pokedex entry?
Nope! The Pokedex will stay at a maximum of 400, regardless of how many event monsters you catch. This may change down the line, but for now, Typhlosion doesn’t affect your Pokedex completion.

Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

We're roughly one month out from the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and another Nintendo property is joining the festivities. Splatoon 3 will host a Zelda-themed Splatfest on the weekend before Tears of the Kingdom's launch.
Running from May 5 to May 7, this special Splatfest will split players up amongst the three sections of the Triforce: Wisdom, Power, and Courage. Pick your favorite aspect of the Triforce, or maybe just your favorite holder to back, and join in the inky battles.
The Splatfest will also host fights on a special version of Scorch Gorge, with a Triforce-style layout. This map seems pretty well-suited to Tricolor Turf Wars in particular, which seems like it could make that mode fairly appealing for the weekend.

Get your Splatoon x Zelda virtual look too
It's not just about the battles, though. As any Splatoon player will tell you, it's as much about the fashion. And this special three-way Splatfest will also have residents of the Splatlands dressing up in themed shirts for the showdown, too.
Themed shirts are also hitting the Nintendo store, for real-life wear. So if you're a fan of both Splatoon and Zelda, and wanted to express that in everyday life, you've got an easy medium for it now. There's also a sale available for a bundle with Splatoon 3 and a three-month Nintendo Switch membership, running from April 17 through May 7.
Nintendo hosted a launch-window Splatfest for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet as well, and it's nice to see them keeping the trend up. It's a fun way to celebrate a new game launch, and all the added theming and cosmetics are a neat touch. So yes, I think I'll be booting Splatoon back up for a few matches, just to lock in my Power vote and shirt.

Although the game still could use some cleaning up, Game Freak is doing a decent job of keeping Pokemon Scarlet & Violet events and promos running: even if most of the latter are fairly small time. Well, there's
Spotted by Japanese Pokemon players via Pokemon Company emails (including this tweet from Twitter user ShxQ183ag88QPe6, who screenshotted the email), these new codes dole out items for the game, and can be redeemed once per save file.
New Mystery Gift codes have rolled out in April
Here's a list of all the codes and when they expire:
LEVEL UP (10 Rare Candies, expires on October 2, 2023)
CATCHBYBALL (Five balls of multiple varieties [Luxury, Quick, Nest, Dive, Dusk, Timer], expires on October 2, 2023)
REV1VE (Five Rare Candies, expires on October 2, 2023)
I know some folks are kinda bummed that so many of these item rollouts are duds, but hey, it's something at least!
Also, remember a Palafin distribution is going on
All of these Mystery Gift codes dropped at once, including one for a special Palafin. That code is "0C1CV1CT0RGAV1N" if you haven't redeemed it yet.
We have more info on the Palafin itself here.

How to redeem Mystery Gift codes in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet
After the treasure hunt starts (read: following your full tour of the academy), you can select the mystery gift option in the main X button menu. Here's how to find the mystery gift menu:
Press X and select "Poke Portal"
On the Poke Portal screen, scroll down and find "mystery gift," then select that option
Select "get with code/password"
Enter the code(s)

First revealed during the 2022 Game Awards, Burning Shores unfolds after the events of Forbidden West as Aloy travels to the ruins of Los Angeles. The untamed area has become a seismically unstable, volcanic archipelago where a new menace and never-before-seen machines await Aloy, who's now joined by a mysterious new companion. 


Burning Shores is only available on PlayStation 5 and cost $19.99. Players will need to have completed the entirety of the main campaign to start the expansion. Once they have, Aloy will receive a call on her Focus which will kick off the DLC.

You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

Frakenstein is often cited as the first science fiction thing, and now it can add to its honours because it's the inspiration for the first major update to V Rising. The info on Secrets Of Gloomrot doesn't actually use the F word anywhere, but it's a new biome "twisted by the tortured ambitions of a scientific genius and his legions of followers", so I feel pretty confident in the citation.

It's a good graphics card, fundamentally speaking, but like many recent releases it's a bit more pricey than it should be at $599 / £589. 
Thankfully though, in the US you can actually pick up AMD's more powerful last-gen flagship card, the RX 6950 XT, for just $10 more thanks to a deal at Newegg.

A few hours ago, the site shocked its users by shutting itself down. A statement in Korean first lays the blame on "outrageous" bandwidth charges but it seems that extraordinary anti-piracy pressure was the reason behind the site's demise.

Mojang Studios has returned to the crafting table in an attempt to take Minecraft in a bold new direction. Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm. Instead of the birds-eye perspective often featured in strategy games, Legends opts for a character-focused view, with your hero roaming the landscape on dynamic mounts, sword in hand, using resources and armies to e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!
Or it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.
Welcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. 
What do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

In a landscape where many major shooters have adopted the free-to-play model, it's extremely hard for a new IP to enter the ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After debuting at £320, the Core i5 13600K has remained resolutely at that price thanks to limited supply and high demand. Now, the 13600K has seen its first major discount, dipping to around the £300 mark at Amazon UK. Meanwhile, the same CPU without integrated graphics, the 13600KF, is down to £281. 
These are solid deals for a great-performing 14-core, 20-thread CPUs that excel in gaming and content creation - especially given that you can pick up a motherboard that allows you to carry over the DDR4 memory in your existing build to keep costs down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At PAX West in Seattle last year, I had the pleasure of interviewing the voice cast of Team Fortress 2. I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.

Fifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as "The Sandvich Saga" on a regular basis.

The GeForce RTX 4070 launches with a heavier price tag than the RTX 3070, and doesn’t make the shin-splintering performance leap forward that its predecessor did, but between its high speeds, low power usage, and DLSS 3 advantage, it’s a potent upgrade regardless.

More generally, consumers could end up paying for blocking, rather than the rightsholders set to benefit from it.

Each year, developers of annualized sports franchises work to craft new experiences to try and avoid the community criticism that each successive release is "just a roster update." While real-life sports don’t evolve much year over year, developers still need to provide players with reasons to come back each time, whether that be gameplay improvements, enhanced modes, or better visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cococucumber - the folks behind the beautifully odd Echo Generation - are ready to release their next voxel adventure, the fairytale slasher Ravenlok coming to PC, Game Pass, and Xbox consoles on May 4th. It’s clearly riffing on Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland as our protagonist, the titular Ravenlok, moves to a new inherited house, gets sucked through a magical mirror and steps into a trippy, mushroom-filled land. From there, she needs to fight this realm's off-brand Queen Of Hearts and save the remaining, slightly weird, storybook denizens.

In a tweet, Arkane reveals that only Quality mode will be available when the game releases on May 2. A 60 FPS Performance option is coming at an unspecified date, but until it does, here’s how the game will run depending on your hardware:
Xbox Series X - 4K 30 FPS
Xbox Series S - 1440p 30 FPS
Sounds like PC is the way to go if you value performance over resolution, but hopefully, it doesn’t take too long for the option to appear on console. For more on Redfall, you can listen to our interview with Arkane Studios’ Harvey Smith in this episode of The Game Informer Show, then check out this article revealing the canceled PlayStation 5 version of the game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frogwares are in a bit of a tight spot at the moment, being as they are a Ukranian studio. If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.
It's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie has become a staggering box office success since its premiere last week. The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

Most of the game’s requirements seem pretty standard for a modern open-world game, although you’ll need some pretty powerful CPUs and GPUs to run the sequel at recommended settings and above. Ripping into hordes in graphic details might cost you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[‘The Tank’, I’ll admit, is a monumentally uninspired name for the mace-wielding brick privy of a man I’d bestowed the dubious honour of soaking up hits in place of my squishier mercs, but when sandbox tactical RPG Wartales let me assemble a party of 12 mad lasses and tapped chaps, the stash of good nicknames was always going to be the first casualty. So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.
“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.

They can run Minecraft servers, download stuff while you're away, let you practice programming, let your younger sibling play with or against you in retro or indie games. You might already have one lying around, in which case have a think about the possibilities - but if you'd like one and don't have one in a cupboard somewhere, you can grab a cheap Dell Latitude 7390 off Ebay for £219.99 in 'good' and 'refurbished' condition. For the money, you get an 8th-gen Core i5 processor with integrated graphics, a compact 13-inch design, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. All in all, it's a pretty sweet spec for the asking price!

In a blog post, the studio states that live support will conclude after September 1. That means it won't receive any new updates, but players can still install and play Dreams – including creating and sharing games – after that date. Previously announced updates will still hit the game before September, such as patches improving animations and the Create mode, as well the Tren update. Events such as DreamsCom, Impy Awards, and All Hallows Dreams will no longer take place as well.

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

EA returns to the PGA with an inconsistent, frustrating simulation, struggling with its identity. While gorgeous, with pro golf’s best interactive presentation, the on-the-course action delivers inconsistent results.
In licensing, EA wins, scoring the Masters and key courses like Pebble Beach. Presentation counts, like the Masters’ first day showing opening tee shots from Jack Nicklaus and others. Quiet commentary meaningfully discusses each hole during flybys. Gorgeous vistas line the courses, and every individually rendered bl…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-11T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.


The Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says "She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth." As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.
While the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.

For more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives this summer, and it's making one last stop on the cover of Game Informer! We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.
Setting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.
Issue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

We’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here. The lifeblood of Japan’s tech industry, all looking down at death, turned to process.

After twenty years of development Dwarf Fortress finally made the jump to Steam in December 2021, complete with exciting new features such as "graphics" and "mouse support". Although the game was already critically lauded, its availability on Steam made it a financial success, with thousands of long-term fans thrilled to provide the brothers with a long-overdue payday. 


Following their panel on the highs and lows of procedural generation, the pair had a chat with Rachel about the game's recent Steam release, upcoming features, their favourite player stories and - most importantly - Zach's dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Live, a fan event celebrating all things Nintendo, is taking place in the U.S. for the first time this September. 
The event, which has previously been held in Japan, will take place in Seattle. It serves as a large convention that will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to play popular Switch titles, take photos with Mario and other characters, and enjoy live entertainment, including game tournaments. The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. 
“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”
There’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available. Nintendo is enjoying a wave of positive momentum this year following the opening of its second Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood as well as the successful premiere of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

In his weekly newsletter for the Guardian, Keith Stewart laments the recent cancellation of this year's in-person E3, highlighting the loss of access an event like E3 offers to journalists that can't be replicated by a glut of sterile, online showcases.
Following the passing of legendary composer Ryuichi Sakamoto last week, Mat Ombler has documented his effect on the world of video games. Featuring quotes from Jesper Kyd, Takeshi Furukawa and Yuji Naka, it's clear that Sakamoto's influence on the way games sound cannot be understated.

At the time, the idea was that the adventure genre was dead – at least in the eyes of major publishers. However, as Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, who made his name working on point-and-click adventure games for LucasArts, seemed to think, there was still a sizable enough audience out there that someone should make a new one. Why not Double Fine? And why not go directly to the source – the fans – for the game's funding?
In Double Fine's pitch, it theorized the then-unnamed project as a smaller game. The company asked for $400,000 from fans – specifically $300,000 to make the game and $100,000 to allow documentary crew 2 Player Productions to film the development. On that last point, Double Fine wo…]]></summary>

Most notably, we’ve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu.

It will now cost $60 rather than the previously planned $50, is no longer bundled together with ARK 2, and will instead include the remasters of Ark: Survival Evolved's several expansions - although most won't be available at launch.

Studio Wildcard also went into more detail as to why this upgraded version is no longer a free update, and why they feel it's necessary to shut down Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers.

McGee says that Electronic Arts have decided to pass on the project. As such, McGee says he has "reached an endpoint with 'Alice' and with game production in general."

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.
Today both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.

I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.
Pill Baby is, obviously, all those things. It's far better and more coherent than any of those descriptions would make it sound.

Luckily, Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is now free to keep on Steam until 6pm BST/ 10am PT/ 1pm ET on April 9th.

starts by suggesting that you play the original game's tutorial. This is included as part of the experience, which, as we'll get to, says a lot about how this sequel has been designed. 


In any case, I disregarded this advice. "I don't need an instruction manual for post-apocalyptic survival," I thought. I've rummaged through this particular abandoned house countless times, after all: In DayZ, in Dead Island, in State Of Decay, in Days Gone. I even reviewed the first Saints And Sinners back in February 2020. I know my way around a zombie's cranium better than anyone.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. 


And yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.


After spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

Plus: what we've been playing this week, and our recommendations! It's a rootin', tootin' good time alright! Apolgies in advance for the recording going on the wonk right at the end, though.

Dlala Studios recently shared an extensive hands-off presentation of its upcoming game, Disney Illusion Island, where we got a chance to see some of the game's early cutscenes and a substantial gameplay demo. Seeing the game in action answered a number of questions and presented a handful of intriguing new ones. For one, the game can be played alone, and though their animations differ, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy all play the same. It's not a Super Mario Bros. 2 situation where they all run at different speeds and jump different heights. No matter who your favorite character is (Donald being an early cont…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players likely recognise Celeste as the pixel-perfect platformer from 2018, but it began its life as Celeste Classic, a free game written for the PICO-8. Celeste Classic presented a condensed climb up the titular mountain, letting you dash across platforms, hang onto walls, and collect strawberries - in miniature form. As a fun homage, you can find the PICO-8 version inside Celeste proper. And now, as an even funner homage, you can play it on the Playdate. A loveable game on a loveable handheld.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.
Lifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics. First up, his first primary ability, Healing Blossom, charges a luminescent flower, which he sends off to teammates. The longer he charges the flower, the more healing it grants to the recipient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
You can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.]]></summary>

While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <id>https://www.scummvm.org/news/archive/#2023-04-01</id>
        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230401/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!
