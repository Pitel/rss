        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the road again
I may not buy much merch from Good Smile Company these days, but showing up to see which video game characters have been immortalized as stylish figures is a fun pastime. How will they be represented in Nendoroid form, and what are the accessories? I like to poke around. In the case of this 30th Anniversary Nendoroid Kirby, it's all about the faces.
After three decades of powerful pink puff action, there's this cutie (via Siliconera):
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1531474322514186240
Nendoroid Kirby: 30th Anniversary Edition comes with accessories like a bindle (the lore of the Kirby series never ceases to amaze me), a sweet potato, a heart, and a Star Rod.
You can do a face-off, too — Kirby's starry-eyed look is a fine default, but there's also "spiral eyes," "a flustered face," and my favorite, the "retro face." Kirby looks so determined! Much like plump Pikachu, it's fun to reflect on how character designs have shifted over the years. Come to think of it, Kirby's retro face smile reminds me of a Mii.
The 30th anniversary Nendoroid Kirby costs $47.99 with an estimated ship date of February 2023, so consider this a present to your future self — how surprised will you be when you bust open the box next year? Pre-orders are open today through July 13, 2022.
Another goodie caught my eye on Good Smile's shop page: a "nap pillow" plush of Waddle Dee that's shaped like a loaf of bread. "I have no mouth, and I must scream," indeed.
30 years of pleasant platforming
In August, the Kirby series will continue its celebration with an anniversary concert at Tokyo Garden Theater. It's been a long and generally pleasant journey, hasn't it?
1996's mind-blowing Kirby Super Star and this year's Kirby and the Forgotten Land are at the top of my list. (Granted, I've missed a lot, but it's hard to imagine anything else resonating with me on this level; both games were a "right place, right time" sorta deal.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He's out as of May 31
After serving Square Enix for over two decades in multiple roles, Shinji Hashimoto has left the company to retire from the industry altogether.
He announced the news directly on his Twitter account (posing with a Chocobo plush), noting that he will retire on May 31 of this year, and will continue to support the company as a fan. Directly following the tweet, Masahiro Sakurai reached out to thank him for his contributions to the field. 2021 was a prelude of sorts to this move, as he stepped down as executive director from the company to focus on other roles.
While Shinji Hashimoto isn't as high-profile as some other members of the Square Enix collective, odds are you've played a game he's worked on extensively, or read heaps of news that involved him indirectly. He was one of the first-ever people to comment on a remake of Final Fantasy VII over a decade ago, and has worked on games from Chocobo Dungeon to Kingdom Hearts III (a series that he in part is responsible for the creation of).
He was also famous for giving biting commentary when asked questions by fans and games writers alike; especially when he was quizzed about bringing back old franchises. Even if he said something people may not want to hear, he was a refreshing change of pace from the typically guarded executive part of the industry in the modern era. I hope he enjoys his retirement, and it'll be fascinating to see where Square Enix goes next, and how they intend to fill his shoes.

In the tweet posted above, Keighley states that SGF will feature events and updates from over 30 partners, with more to be announced. For now, the line-up includes: 
2K
Activision
Atlus
Bandai Namco
Bloober Team
Capcom
Coffee Stain
Deep Silver
Devolver Digital
Digital Extremes
Dotemu
EA
Epic Games
Focus Entertainment
Frost Giant Studios
Humble Games

Mediatonic
miHoYo
Netflix
PlayStation
Raw Fury
Samsung Gaming Hub
Sega
Square Enix
Skybound Games
Steam
Studio MDHR
Tribeca Festival
Warner Bros. Games
Xbox
Now that we have a clearer idea of which companies have something to show, the speculation can begin. Will Bloober Team reveal its long-rumored Silent Hill project or its already announced Layers of Fear sequel? Will Dotemu finally spill the beans on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge release date? Square Enix has already teased something Final Fantasy VII-related for the event; could it be a Remake 2 reveal? We'll get all those answers and more next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 50,000 items already vaulted
Embracer Group, the holding company that plays host to THQ Nordic, Gearbox Entertainment, and, most recently, Eidos Montreal, has announced the formation of a new games preservation archive that hopes to curate the world's largest collection of video games, consoles, computers, and related chicanery.
The Embracer Games Archive, which is housed in the company headquarters in Karlstad, Sweden, already boasts a collection of over 50,000 software and hardware items, from the oldest of video game releases to the most modern console platforms. A team of archivists, engineers, and researchers has been assigned to source, grow, and ensure the safekeeping of the archive's contents.
While there are currently no plans to open the archive as a public viewing gallery, Embracer Group plans to allow access to researchers and academics as a record of the artistic, technological, and design history of our favorite pastime. In time, Embracer may make the archive available for public perusal in the form of satellite exhibitions, but for now, it appears that the team is concentrating on the sourcing and collecting of items to further expand upon its impressive catalog.
In an increasingly digital world, any form of games preservation is becoming increasingly important, and while it's just as essential that private collectors the world over continue to gather relics from gaming's 50-year history, Embracer Group has the finance and resources to locate, purchase, curate, and maintain the condition of an artistic and innovate history often overlooked by mainstream museums.
You can read more about the Embracer Games Archive over on its official website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Meat Boy hurts so good
A busy new month of gaming awaits us, so before we all forget, let's quickly look over the Xbox Games with Gold lineup for June. Soon enough, subscribers will be able to nab the original version of Super Meat Boy, as well as another gem from the Xbox Live Arcade era, Raskulls, and two city-builders: Aven Colony (from 2017) and Project Highrise (from 2018).
For June 2022, Xbox Games with Gold is giving out four free games:
Aven Colony (June 1–30)
Project Highrise: Architect’s Edition (June 16–July 15)
Super Meat Boy (June 1–15)
Raskulls (June 16–30)
With an active Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you can redeem these games during those listed time frames, then keep 'em for good.
Many of us have been there and back again with Super Meat Boy — a true test of determination just as much as platforming reflexes. It's one of those greats in its genre, and this is the original Xbox Live Arcade edition, so grab your headphones and crank it up.
[caption id="attachment_324647" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Aven Colony.[/caption]
The other throwback for June is Raskulls, a frantic action-platformer that's notable around here for its sharp-dressed Mr. Destrctoid cameo, while Aven Colony and Project Highrise are a bit newer (but not exactly "fresh"). The former is a city-builder with drones and aliens, while the latter is going for a more squished SimTower vibe. Not a bad spread!
More games to check out sooner than later
Some of the May selections, including Viva Piñata Party Animals, are still claimable.
While we're talking about what's coming and going, there's also an update on Xbox Game Pass, with highlights like Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection on June 2, and Assassin's Creed Origins, Chorus, and Disc Room on June 7. Eric has the latest Game Pass recap for June.

Nexon's decision to drop a brand new trailer for each and every feature in its incoming fighter DNF Duel is certainly... a choice, but I suppose it helps to communicate to the fighting game community that the plucky underdog title will be stepping into the ring loaded for bear when it arrives in June.
This latest lightning-fast video focuses specifically on DNF Duel's online options, which include Ranked Vs battles, a full online ranking system, player profile cards, and a replay library — an invaluable tool when it comes to rewatching and reassessing everything that you and your chosen fighter might have gotten right, or so very wrong. In all, the online options for DNF Duel look pretty standard, though it should be recalled that the Arc System Works-developed…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These geese are going maverick
Yu Suzuki and his studio YS Net are working on a game for Apple Arcade. The crew revealed it as Air Twister today, and its trailer is a pretty fun way to kick off the summer of video game news.
The trailer kicks off with death and destruction, as infantry riding giant birds fight in battle against robots. The protagonist, Princess Arch, mourns a swan before taking off and leaping the trailer into a vastly different tone.
Suddenly it's showing gameplay, with a Killer Queen-sound-alike blasting in the background. It is truly incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1A5WJ2YFVc
According to the App Store page, Air Twister is an endless shooter. Players move around the screen using swipe movements and blast enemies out of the sky. There are 12 stages, over 20 different enemies and 10 unique bosses, Stars to collect and global rankings to chase.
Suzuki is apparently hesitant to call this a Space Harrier successor though. In a briefing (via GameSpot) Suzuki said he's always had this idea for a fantasy shooting game, but the limited available tech ended up leading to Space Harrier. With 2022's tech, he's made Air Twister, which he calls his "ideal fantasy shooting game."

The golden goose
The last game we saw from Suzuki and YS Net was Shenmue III, the latest entry in the Shenmue series that felt like a time capsule. Seeing the team turn its efforts towards mobile is an interesting move. But one that clearly makes an impression. Yes, I'm surprised by the fantasy shooter with geese, spacesuits, lasers, and robots. I can't say I'm not intrigued to see what it becomes, though.
Those interested won't need to wait long, either. Air Twister hits Apple Arcade on June 24. Alongside it are a few other releases for the mobile gaming platform. Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins sets off on June 3, and Cooking Mama: Cuisine! lands on June 17.

Double headlines for Virtua Fighter fans today. Following on from the news that Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown will be receiving its Tekken crossover DLC tomorrow, separate news sees publisher Discotek Media announce plans to release the long-forgotten '90s anime adaptation of Sega's fighting franchise.
Speaking on Twitter, Discotek Media revealed that all 35 episodes of the Virtua Fighter anime, which first premiered way back in 1996, will be released on Blu-ray at an undisclosed point in 2022. It should be noted, immediately, that the release is SD-BD, and thus the anime will, sadly, not be remastered in high definition. While no reason is offered for this, it is often a common practice when the source material is simply not of a decent enough quality to offer remaster potential.
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1530550433432760320?s=20&amp;t=igw5Phe3QuuBQDAyUaK3mg
On a more positive note, the new release will feature all 35 episodes of the anime, meaning fans who are still waiting on an official edition of the final 11 episodes, previously unreleased by Anime Works, will finally be able to add them to your collection. All 35 episodes will feature English subtitles, and the original English dub for the first 24 episodes is also in the mix. More extras are to be revealed in the future.
While I won't deny the lack of an HD remaster or a full, fresh series dub for the entire series is disappointing, it's nice to see the forgotten anime finally make a home video comeback in its entirety. The Virtua Fighter Blu-ray will no doubt find a pride of place alongside Discotek's other video game anime rerelease, which include SNK's Fatal Fury and Capcom's Darkstalkers.

The announcement that Nintendo will be closing the 3DS and Wii U eShop stores and effectively sunsetting those consoles has caused many of us to fire up our old systems and survey our digital libraries. Both of these consoles represent the first generation of Nintendo hardware where it was possible to build an entirely digital library if you so chose, so the fact that each one's dedicated digital store is being closed to new purchases in "late March 2023" means that the clock is now ticking to make sure everything you wanted to buy is purchased and downloaded to your system — and ideally backed up in some form.

When Does The 3DS And Wii U eShop Close? Nintendo eShop Closure Guide

In this guide, we cover the basics for securing your consoles as they enter this end-of-life phase. We'll recommend certain practices and products you might want to consider to help keep your systems in tip-top shape, as well as providing useful information that you may want to act on before the digital stores close in March 2023.

French video game developer DONTNOD — who you may know from games like Life is Strange, Tell Me Why, and Life is Strange 2 — have officially changed their name as of today, May 31st. Except it's less of a name change, and more of a "you people have been saying it wrong" change.
As part of a massive rebrand of the company, they announced today on their Twitter and blog that their name is now DON'T NOD, with a space and an apostrophe that weren't there before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still due on June 23, 2022
The Sonic Origins file size has been revealed, at least on Switch, and the base edition clocks in at 3.6GB, quite a bit larger than Sonic Mania.
For reference, Sonic Mania sits comfortably at 390MB, which is great news for folks who don't have a ton of space on their Switch. Sonic Origins, again, is nearly 10 times that amount, and the Digital Deluxe Edition adds a little heft, coming in at 3.8GB (the Nintendo store size is erroneous, and the actual eShop listing shows the correct size).
As a reminder, that Sonic Origins file size includes the following games (plus extras):
Sonic 1
Sonic 2
Sonic 3 & Knuckles
Sonic CD
The Digital Deluxe Edition includes "bonus hard missions, additional music tracks, backgrounds, character animations, and an island camera," which accounts for that extra space.
I hope after all this, and all of the confusing pre-order layers, that this ends up paying off. Sonic could always use a win, and coming off of the successful film would be great timing. Plus, with a quality product, the company can set up Sonic Frontiers for success if it continues to ride that wave. As usual though it is Sonic: so anything is possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Frontiers was teased way back in 2019 before it was teased once again in 2021. It was originally supposed to drop last year, but it instead became a 2022 title, with a new trailer debuting at The Game Awards 2021. Now, as we anticipate the Blue Blur’s 3D return sometime this year, Sega has released a new teaser trailer that gives us just a taste of Sonic’s first open-world foray, and it looks awesome. 
This new teaser comes by way of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which released the trailer alongside news that Sonic Frontiers is getting the IGN First treatment in June. In fact, according to the tweet, we’ll be getting some world-exclusive reveals very soon, which, if this teaser trailer is anything to go off of, means we’ll probably be getting some extended looks at gameplay in June. For now, the teaser trailer below will have to do: 


As you can see in the trailer, there’s a lot going on in just this quick 30-second glimpse. There’s plenty of full-speed, open-world running, lots of rails to grind on, enemies to destroy, and it appears there are even tower-like checkpoints to activate or interact with. I’d wager you have to do this to open up more of the game’s open-world map, but that’s just a guess for now. Hopefully, we will learn more soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take it to the Chorus
The Xbox Game Pass lineup for the start of June is out, and it's got some familiar faces. Ubisoft games, indies, and spaceships make up the first few June Xbox Game Pass entrants, though it sounds like more are in store.
Assassin's Creed Origins is one of the headliners, bringing the massive journey through ancient Egypt onto cloud, console, and PC. As the first of Ubisoft's major overhaul of the series, it's historically relevant. And also, I'd argue, pretty alright. It's also getting 60 FPS support on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles on June 2, so good timing.
Another entry takes a different trip down memory lane. The Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection gathers up three games from the Ninja Gaiden series, plus all modes and DLC, into one set. If you've never seen Ryu Hayabusa in action outside the Dead or Alive fighting games, this seems like a good way to handle that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcvpVjEjVuk
Spacelines from the Far Out is the available day-one launch in June's early Game Pass lineup. It's a rogue-like co-op management game, and seems to mix some throwback aesthetics with space travel. It's got some Jetsons vibes, which seems pretty neat.
Xbox teases that it isn't done for the month, either. More games, release dates, and "possibly a few surprises" are in store. Maybe we'll get some news on more Game Pass updates at that upcoming Xbox and Bethesda showcase?
Xbox Game Pass Games for June
For Honor: Marching Fire Edition (Cloud, console, PC) - June 1
Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection (Console and PC) - June 2
Assassin’s Creed Origins (Cloud, Console and PC) - June 7
Chorus (Cloud, Console, and PC) - June 7

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsettling horror for Halloween.
Publisher Soedesco and developer Red Martyr Entertainment have announced that their point-and-click horror game, Saint Kotar, now has a release date!
Saint Kotar was funded via Kickstarter back in 2020 and received a successful PC release last October. The Croatian-developed game also had the honour of being named Croatian Game of the Year 2021 last December. The Switch release was part of the initial Kickstarter campaign and was originally due to release last year, however, the developers needed more time to polish the game up for consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 5 at 7AM ET
An Acquire (the Akiba's Trip studio) showcase is coming, helping to kick off "E3" a bit earlier this year, on June 5 at 7AM ET.
The news was announced via their Twitter account, and they're taking questions, provided that you use the hashtag "#アクワイアへの質問." As a reminder, we have a full list of all of the "E3" streams for June 2022 here, and Acquire is actually one of the first, which will help kick things off. Before them, Sony is doing their thing with a State of Play on June 2, followed by a June 9 Summer Game Fest kickoff.
Acquire is one of those Japanese companies that's been around forever, quietly making games. It blew up immediately after the release of Tenchu 1 and 2, before the series was taken away from them shortly after (oh what could have been). From there they continued down a similar path with Way of the Samurai and Shinobido, before hitting it big in 2011 with Akiba's Trip.
Since then they've been collaborating with various studios (including doing some co-development work on Octopath Traveler), and supplementing their income with multiple Akiba's Trip titles. As Gematsu points out, we can expect at least one new reveal following a leak: Class of Heroes Quest.
Where to watch the Acquire June 2022 showcase:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Extremely Shania Twain voice]: Let's go girls.
Sega is betting big on Sonic Frontiers this year, and just ahead of a June blowout, the company shared a "small preview" of the game's open-world action and exploration gameplay. Sega says to expect more info "all June long," but for now, here's roughly 20 seconds of honest-to-goodness (albeit chopped up and teaser-ified) gameplay footage.
Is this what you were expecting from Sonic Frontiers?
https://youtu.be/BS9YAiD9EP8
As someone who really only properly gets into Sonic's side-scrolling adventures, the idea of a 3D Sonic game that takes cues from Breath of the Wild has been intriguing, admittedly — enough for me to pay attention to the news and teaser videos like this one.
That said, talk about an incredibly tall order for Sonic Team. Many of us know to go in with modest expectations, and I'm sticking to that strategy until proven otherwise.
Try as we might, there's only so much to glean from this out-of-context Sonic Frontiers gameplay clip. A realistic-ish green landscape with floating rails dotting the horizon? Not exactly the strongest first impression. In the new footage, Sonic runs on a wheel to power up a radar (?), zips around robots in a combat encounter, and ultimately scales a big boy.
The promise of "open-zone freedom"
For me, whether this game succeeds or not will boil down to two general questions: is it inherently fun to traverse this world, and do I feel rewarded for exploring beyond the quickest path forward? If Sonic Frontiers can clear those bars, that'll be a good starting point for keeping my interest in the run-up to reviews and the game's launch this year.
Sega will be back with more Sonic Frontiers reveals starting tomorrow, June 1, on IGN.
Today's teaser didn't divulge any new release timing info, but Sonic Frontiers is confirmed for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[She has a few comprehensive videos at this point
Yelan is the big star of Genshin Impact's 2.7 update, and following a story reveal, we now have a ton of info on her gameplay nuances.
As a hydro bow user, Yelan hails from Liyue, and represents the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Her gimmick involves charging aimed shots out of combat, as well as firing off an ability that scales based on her HP (making her easy to build for), and she's armed with one of the coolest looking elemental bursts in the game (that deals area-of-effect hydro damage). Thematically, her passive grants her 25% extra rewards if you put her in a 20-hour Liyue expedition.
Once again, miHoYo has done a fantastic job of selling me on a character. On paper I didn't really have much interest in picking up Yelan, but her "Shadow in the Rain" clip has so much style to it, and I'm getting Fujiko Mine vibes from her personality (the music contributes to it). You can watch nearly 10 minutes of footage below and make the decision on your own!
She headlines the 2.7 update, which is out now (it released late last night in the US). We're getting closer and closer to the big 3.0 expansion.
Here's the big six-minute rundown of Yelan:

And here's a shorter, flashier character demo:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The day the music died
The Pokemon Diamond and Pearl sound library is only a few months old, but it's already shutting its doors. Nintendo and The Pokemon Company confirmed its closure today, May 31.
Over on the sound library site, a message states that the service was terminated as of 9 a.m. UTC this morning. It also thanks those who supported the service since launch.
Anyone who downloaded sound data from the site is still allowed to use it, as long as it's within the Terms of Use and Guidelines previously set out. The site will stay up to keep hosting those Guidelines, just not the music itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUOlZBxdrTA
Diamonds aren't forever
It's a bit of a bummer, considering the sound library for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl only launched in February of this year. The website featured music from both of the Sinnoh region games, at a time when Sinnoh sentiment was high
The sound library contained plenty of neat possibilities. It was completely functional as a basic radio, for those who just wanted to enjoy the sounds of Sinnoh at home.
Or, for musicians and others, it was a repository of samples. The sound library for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl being available for non-commercial use was good for fans. Pokemon fans might have been able to use those noises for anything, from wrestling entrances to wedding processions.
Nintendo has historically cracked down when it comes to copyright issues. Usually, that means making it difficult for fans to listen to music somewhere online, or find usable tools for content creation. Square Enix recently tackled this issue, opening its own YouTube channel filled with Final Fantasy and other RPG series music.
For Diamond and Pearl fans, it looks like the sound repository is shut down for the time being. Hopefully all the Pokemon rap creators already got their samples.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well how's that for short notice
In case you have Mistover on your wishlist somewhere, you should probably know that the game is going away for good fairly soon.
Here's the full statement from the game's official site:
"To everyone who has shown their love and support for Mistover, we regretfully inform you with a heavy heart that the service will be closing as our journey comes to an end. We first launched Mistover on October 10th, 2019, and we made the difficult decision to close the service for this much-loved game effective June 30th, 2022. We are deeply grateful to everyone who has used our services and would like to ask for your generous understanding."

So how is this going down? Well, all platforms are impacted, including PC (Steam, GOG), PS4, Switch, and Xbox.  The end date is June 30, 2022, at which point it'll be deleted from those storefronts. The company stress that "even after the game no longer becomes available, customers who have already purchased the game will be able to download it."
While the above site doesn't give an exact reason, the Japanese Arc System Works site (who published the game) states that it is "due to the expiration of the sales license agreement with Krafton," the developer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day of the Devs: SGF Edition also detailed.
It's almost time for another Summer Geoff Game Fest and new details have been released for the upcoming series of events, including details on Day of the Devs: SGF Edition and a partner list of participants who will feature in the two-hour show on Thursday 10th June.
While there are more companies "to be announced in the coming days", you may be disappointed to see that Nintendo doesn't feature in a first-party capacity. Although Nintendo has been a part of Keighley's The Game Awards shows in the past, it's not totally unexpected that the company won't have a presence in this Summer showcase. A Nintendo Direct event around the same period is practically a certainty at this point, and third-party Switch games will obviously feature in Geoff Keighley's event. However, at the time of writing, Nintendo doesn't appear to have anything lined up for Summer Game Fest itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has begun to announce its upcoming slate of Game Pass titles for next month, with six games joining the service in the opening days of June. Sharpen your blades and get ready for plenty of action with the three big games coming to the subscription service over the next week. Ubisoft is providing two games with For Honor: Marching Fire Edition hitting tomorrow and Assassin's Creed Origins arriving on June 7, just in time for Series X owners to enjoy the new 60FPS update. Koei Tecmo is also bringing Ryu Hyabusa's remastered trilogy of 3D adventures to Game Pass with the June 2 addition of Ninja Gaiden Master Collection. 
Here's the full list of Game Pass additions coming in the first part of June:
For Honor: Marching Fire Edition – June 1 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Ninja Gaiden Master Collection – June 2 (Console and PC)
Assassin's Creed Origins – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Chorus – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Disc Room – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Spacelines from the Far Out – June 7 (Console and PC)
With new games joining the service, others are often leaving as well. Get your game time in with the following titles that will be gone from Game Pass on June 15:
Darkest Dungeon (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Greedfall (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Limbo (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Worms Rumble (Console, PC, and Cloud)
This newest Game Pass update only stretches into the first week of June, but keep in mind that Xbox and Bethesda are holding their joint showcase of upcoming games on June 12. Keep your eyes peeled on that presentation and Game Informer for more updates on what's coming to Game Pass in the future.]]></summary>

Blaze's Evercade family of systems has proven to be something of a hit in the Nintendo Life office for a wide range of reasons – one of which is the fact that the system offers legitimate access to some classic NES and SNES titles via its range of physical carts.
The original handheld was joined by a home console variant last year, and today – on the second birthday of the Evercade range – manufacturer Blaze has revealed the next entry in this line of systems: the Evercade EXP.

It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.


It’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?

The reason napabar — who runs the YouTube channel Will It Work? — wants to get the glove controlling this mixed reality game is because it will involve using the tilt controls of the glove to actually move a physical object around the house without touching it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft should have announced this with the Xbox Series X reveal
Banjo-Threeie isn't a real thing yet, but after watching this fan-crafted trailer from Project Dream, I want it to be. Although the project stresses that it "will not be made into a playable game," I would play it today if it was released.
Here's the full pitch from the creators:
"The Adventure Continues! Banjo-Threeie takes place 22 years after the defeat of Gruntilda in Banjo-Tooie.. However, for a third time the old hag is back and stronger than ever.. She has gathered an army bigger than you could imagine.. And she's out for her final revenge! Battle your way through an inspired story exploring fantastical worlds collecting notes & jiggys! Be captivated by magical transformations into different shapes of Banjo & Kazooie to unlock puzzles and jiggies, as well as fighting an array of terrifying bosses to defeat Gruntilda and her army for one last time."

Note that the trailer does in fact have its own music track! If you're interested in the "main theme" of the faux game, you can check it out here: it's composed by Dark-Grunt.
We have a serious shortage of AAA mascot platformers in the current era. We do get some third-party efforts, but I could go for a new entry in a series like this. It's beloved enough, and relevant enough with its enduring legacy, plus it's bolstered by a fairly recent Smash Bros. appearance. Games like A Hat in Time have also shown publishers that the audience is there still.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising launched in Steam Early Access on May 17, and the vampire action survival game has quickly taken the world by storm. Developer Stunlock Studios revealed that the game has pushed past 1.5 million copies sold in only two weeks.
Stunlock doesn’t provide an exact sales number, but 1.5 million+ is a remarkable feat for a game technically in its infancy. V Rising has been popular on Twitch and has garnered strong reviews thus far. The game puts you in the undead boots of a newly awakened vampire who must build their empire. Similar to games like Valheim, players explore an open world in search of resources (either from nature itself or by pillaging villages) to construct a castle and become the second coming of Dracula. Combat pushes you to use your supernatural abilities to take down a host of otherworldly creatures, and you can tackle the game alongside friends in co-op. You can also attack other players’ castles in PvP. 


As an Early Access title, V Rising will continue to receive updates and improvements over the next several months. The game’s Steam page states that Stunlock hopes to launch the game in 1.0 within the next 12 months, barring any changes.]]></summary>

Sega's Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown gets its cosplay on this week, as its roster of knuckle-flinging pugilists dons the garb of its fellow 3D fighting title, Tekken. The Virtua Fighter x Tekken costume collaboration DLC will launch tomorrow on PlayStation platforms, priced at $9.99 USD.
The previously teased DLC package features new looks for all 19 members of the Virtua Fighter roster, each of whom will be replicating the look of one of Tekken's iconic heroes and/or villains. So whether you want to see Akira Yuki as Kazuya Mishima, Aoi as Asuka Kazama, Vanessa Lewis as Master Raven or, of course, Wolf Hawkfield as Tekken's own giant swinger, King, then this fun new DLC has got you covered. Looking good, gang. Check out Pai Chan as Lily!
https://youtu.be/8_FK6YtQnQE
If that wasn't enough, then you also have 20 classic Tekken hits added to the soundtrack, and the DLC even includes the option of switching out the Virtua Fighter U.I. with that of Tekken's King of Iron Fist Tournament, giving the entire playing field a funky new facelift to match its cosplay action. Nice touch.
Of course, this is not exactly "Virtua Fighter vs. Tekken", which currently remains the stuff of a madman's dream. Fighting games have gotten pretty obsessed with the concept of guest stars and crossovers in recent years — collaborations that are far more likely today than they were back in the 1990s — so never say never. Still, Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown does not have the character accessories necessary to turn Vanessa Lewis into KoF's Leona Heidern (something that was possible in previous release Final Showdown), so let's get that back on the priority list, Sega!
Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown is available now on PS4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh Boy
In what has now become a regular monthly event, the next PlayStation Plus offerings have been leaked ahead of their official announcement — As noted by regular spoiler billbil-kun of Dealabs, June will see PS Plus subscribers bag themselves copies of Sony's God of War, Gamemill's Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Bandai Namco's Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np1jPkg3R6Q
Assuming that the leak is genuine, (and there's very little reason to believe it isn't), the three titles will be available to download from June 7 until July 5. The June titles will replace May's offerings of EA's FIFA 22, Focus Entertainment's Curse of the Dead Gods, and Gearbox Publishing's Tribes of Midgard, so be sure to secure your license for these three titles before they vanish for good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yl-_LYD0ik
June will also see Sony launch its revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service. The new service offers three distinct subscription tiers — Essentials, Extra and Premium — which will afford access to a rotating library of PlayStation releases on PS5, PS4, PS2, and the original PlayStation, dependent on your membership. Sony will continue to offer up a monthly selection of "to-keep" titles for all subscribers, regardless of their respective subscription tier.

Originally launched back in 2001 by developer Sonnori, the game was subsequently remade for PS4, PC, and mobile devices in 2015. Its gameplay takes place via a first-person perspective in which you, as protagonist Lee Hui-min, must explore a school, solve puzzles, and hide from the game's enemies.

Have you ever wished that you could display your tweets through a NES? You haven't? Well, no, neither have we... That hasn't stopped such a weird and miraculous feat from being accomplished however, and we love the outcome.
ConnectedNES, designed by Rachel Weil, is an open-source project that allows a live feed of tweets to be displayed via a NES console. It's all quite complex stuff for our feeble minds, but effectively it utilises a particle photon to 'convert' tweets into specific button presses through the NES controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 1 at 9AM ET
We've been waiting for news on the pair of games for a while, and The Pokemon Company has finally announced that a Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer is on the way
The news comes via a tweet from the official Pokemon UK account, and we have an actual date/time: June 1 at 9AM ET. For clarity, you can find the trailer here on the official Pokemon YouTube account. The tweet suggests turning on notifications, and hasn't provided a live stream link.
All we have to go on at the moment is that it will feature "the latest on Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet," and that it seemingly isn't a lengthy showcase. Historically, these types of reveals involve narrated trailers, sometimes upward of 10 minutes or more in length, which showcase some of the game's locales, creatures, and features.
The current hope is that the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer puts its best foot forward, showcasing potential future developments that feel like an evolution of the series: rather than resting on the laurels of Sword and Shield. In the wake of Pokemon Legends, it feels imperative that they actually highlight significant changes and upgrades, as people will be expecting it.
Based on what they've shown so far though, those expectations aren't super high.

More specifically, Monument Valley: Panoramic Edition and Monument Valley II: Panoramic Edition will hit PC on July 12. Both of these illusion-based geometric puzzle games were released on iOS and Android devices in 2014 and 2017 respectively, and now, for the first time ever, they’ll be playable on non-mobile devices. As the name implies, the view of the game, which is longer than it is horizontal as a result of being mobile games, will be shifted to account for PC monitors. Instead, both Monument Valley games will be presented in a wide view and you can see what that looks like below thanks to the series’ art director:
We're making Monument Valley WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE

May 31, 2022
Both games can be added to Steam wishlists right now and unsurprisingly, in order to run these games on your PC, you’re not going to need much horsepower at all. As for price, each will be available for $7.99 and both games will come with their previously released DLC, which incudes Ida’s Dream and Forgotten Shores for Monument Valley and The Lost Forest for Monument Valley II. 
While waiting for July 12, read Game Informer’s Monument Valley review and then read Game Informer’s Monument Valley II review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Port-begging works, right?).
Japanese developer Team Ladybug is really good at homages. Its output so far has been dominated by titles with a Metroidvania theme, with the excellent Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth drawing massive inspiration from the game that helped coin the genre's name – Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Wonder Labyrinth recently came to Switch (along with fellow Metroidvania Touhou Luna Nights), and we dearly, dearly hope that Team Ladybug's next project follows suit.
Its title suggests that Drainus is a playful take on Konami's Gradius, but it's very much its own thing with its own unique ideas – the most obvious being the ability to absorb incoming projectiles and lasers and fire them back at the enemy in the form of lock-on missiles. The more fire you soak up, the more aggressive your response will be; the caveat here is that you can't absorb fire indefinitely, and timing when to use this power is of vital importance, as getting it wrong means incoming bullets will damage your ship. You also have to contend with bullets that can't be absorbed; these are denoted by their red outline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix is synonymous with widely known JRPG franchises like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, and Nier. However, a lesser-known series that's produced some under-the-radar experiences is returning. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered is launching on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and iOS and Android devices this winter. 
The instruments change, but 30 years later the melody remains the same.

May 31, 2022
Minstrel Song dropped exclusively on PlayStation 2 in 2005. The updated visuals (changed from bit art to 3D) don't do much to improve the very bizarre character designs, but fans of the series that never got to play it more than a decade ago will finally get to test their skills with the game's combat and class systems. 
Minstrel Song itself is a remake of the original Romancing SaGa game released on the Super Famicom in 1992. The narrative follows eight adventurers as they try to stop the resurgence of an ancient deity of darkness. 
The Game Informer archives reveal that Joe Juba gave Romancing SaGa a 5 out of 10 and said that the game vied for the worst RPG of the year. Hopefully, the remaster gives it a second lease on life. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered drops on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and mobile devices later this year.]]></summary>

If it's like trailers in years past, we'll likely learn more about the world of Gen 9, including some new looks at Pokémon, locales we'll be visiting, and, if we're lucky, a look at the two main legendaries that will appear on the boxes of these two Switch games.

I'm hoping to see the legendaries we'll be encountering and a release date. We only know the games are releasing in "Late 2022." That likely means somewhere in the October through November timeframe if this gen follows previous generations' steps. Still, I'd love to get official confirmation of when I'll be playing this game and picking Quaxly, the best starter, to join me on my adventure. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about the original Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet announcement, which included our first looks at the three starters this time around. Then, check out all of the Pokémon confirmed for these games thus far. Check out this breakdown of all the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet version differences and exclusives revealed after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Boy! Get ready to download the latest game I was included in,” is probably what Kratos would say to Atreus if he read this story. That’s because reliable PlayStation Plus leaker source Deallabs has reportedly leaked the June PS Plus games and the lineup includes God of War, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker. 
This news comes by way of Deallabs, naturally, as reported by Eurogamer and if it’s like previous months, the former is correct. If this leak does end up being correct, PS Plus subscribers will have those three games to look forward to from June 7 to July 5. 
This wouldn’t be the most surprising lineup, especially when you consider God of War: Ragnarok is slated to release sometime in 2022. Perhaps it’s coming sooner than later and Sony is releasing God of War as a way to begin the marketing for its sequel. 
This leak, if true, would techincally be the first month of PS Plus post-Sony’s revamp, which includes three new tiers of the subscription service that essentially combine Plus with the company’s cloud streaming service, PlayStation Now. Only time will tell if this leak is like those in months past. We’re likely just a day or two away from finding out what games are officially free to download for PS Plus subscribers in June.

Square Enix has unveiled Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered, a newly revamped edition of the cult PlayStation 2 fantasy JRPG. It will launch on PC, console, and mobile platforms in winter 2022
The story of a malevolent force's return and the quest to prevent the ensuing destruction, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song launched on PS2 in 2005, and is itself a remake of the original SNES Romancing SaGa adventure, which launched way back in 1992. Since its release, the original PS2 edition of the adventure often changes hands for a pretty penny on auction sites, and so this new release will be welcomed by those wishing to experience the remake for themselves.
As is the case for most classic JRPG remasters, Square Enix's new edition of Minstrel Song will support HD resolutions and feature optimized controls and several quality-of-life features to aid playability on modern platforms. New content is also hinted at. You can check out an early trailer below, and see the first screenshots over on the game's official website.
Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms, with a tentative release date of winter 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few minor fixes just came out
A new N64 on Switch patch was recently released alongside of Kirby 64, and some sneaky dataminers have managed to once again uncover some invisible patch notes. Most famously, Nintendo fixed the fog in Ocarina of Time, which was one of the most egregious emulation releases in some time, and one of myriad errors.
Over on Twitter, Switch "tinkerer" and Dolphin contributor OatmealDome figured out a basic patch notes rundown for the update, titled "version 2.3.0:"
Kirby 64 added
Star Fox 64 had gamma adjustment enabled — gamma value was set to 1.8.
Dr. Mario 64 had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_0” added)
Mario Golf had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_1” added).
In short, you can see the results of the render fixing in the N64 on Switch patch here, and the gamma adjustment for Star Fox 64 is more obviously apparent. OatmealDome also notes that Kirby 64 is actually the least-touched N64 game to date, stating, "Kirby 64 appears to have the least amount of patches and hacks that I’ve seen so far for this emulator. There are the usual renderer settings adjustments present, but there are no CPU instruction patches or hooks."
With that in mind, Kirby 64 also has a soft lock bug that will need to be addressed in the future. It occurs in underwater stages in specific conditions, but it's something for Nintendo to note nonetheless.
[Update: Nintendo has acknowledged the Kirby 64 issue in a recent tweet, calling it a "bug that can prevent players progressing under a certain condition." The patch is scheduled to arrive "early next week." For Nintendo, this is a pretty fast response!]
[Update #2: "Early next week" was pretty early! It has been patched as of May 30.]

The Game Boy was hugely influential in the game industry, playing its part in bringing video games into the mainstream.

Those limitations, though, can be a strength in the right hands.
That's highlighted rather nicely in the tweet below from pixel artist Klas Benjaminsson, showcasing some works produced on Nintendo's classic portable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Digital Deluxe size is smaller.
Update  It seems like some wires have crossed between the My Nintendo Store and the eShop. The file size for Sonic Origins' Digital Deluxe edition is much smaller than what's recorded on the web version.
Instead, the Digital Deluxe version comes in at a much more reasonable 3.8GB. The ordinary release is also a smidge smaller, at 3.5GB. Still both bigger than Mania, but Origins is a collection of games along with a museum, extra music, challenges, and cutscenes. This isn't a concrete figure, either, but we just wanted to give you an idea of what the file size might be.

With AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative launching next month, we're taking another dive into the minds of Spike Chunsoft to see what improvements are being made to the game.
Unique to this detective game is the ability to dive into a character's "Somnium", a dream world where a person's memories manifest. You must search for the truth deep inside that person's memories within a limited amount of time, no matter how painful it may be. This was a key part of the first game, and it makes its return in the sequel with some added tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Music to the ears of many.
Square Enix's SaGa series is not one we expected a renaissance from in recent years. Known for their unusual levelling techniques, unique mechanics, and interesting stories that span generations, the games have had a mixed level of success in the West. But with ports of Romancing SaGa 2 and 3, and a remaster of PS1 cult classic SaGa Frontier (among many other rereleases), the series' devoted following has been rewarded in recent times.
And they're going to keep on reaping the benefits of this revival too. Today, Square Enix held an official series live stream where it revealed its next SaGa-related project — Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song, originally a PS2 exclusive and a remake of the first Romancing SaGa game, is getting a remaster later this year, and it's coming to all consoles!

This week sees the launch of Activision Blizzard's hellish new MMO, Diablo Immortal. But while the free-to-play mobile title is preparing to unleash its evil upon most of the planet, two countries will reportedly be blocking the title's launch due to their respective laws on in-game purchases.
Initially reported by Dutch news outlet Tweakers, both Belgium and The Netherlands have refused Diablo Immortal service within the countries' borders due to "the current operating conditions in these countries." It should be noted that both countries in question have taken staunch stances against the controversial "loot box" mechanic, which continues to skirt around various gambling laws worldwide.

“Why indeed?” Shouldice answers after a beat with a chuckle and a dramatic tone that suggests Tunic’s development cycle was a long one. There is no single incident he can point to that spurred him into making his choice. Instead, several factors, including how much he enjoyed making past one-off projects and his dwindling excitement for his job, influenced his decision to strike out on his own. His departure wasn’t without uncertainty.

Fortnite’s cartoonish aesthetic and enticing crossovers scratched my casual FPS itch, but the base-building mechanic constantly shattered combat momentum. Warzone’s sensory overload was downright overwhelming. With arena sizes that seemingly rivaled open-world games, a high combatant count, and annoying purchasable killstreaks, Call of Duty’s battle royale reminded me that less is more.

I'll be honest, I've been stumped for a while trying to come up with a fitting theme for this Destructoid Draws. So far, the Encore series has been trying to mirror the original one. Dream Crossovers was the tock to Favorite Franchises' tick. Favorite Sidekicks naturally followed from Favorite Villains. And, uh... we did Guilty Gear twice. As a treat.
But this time around, I did not know how to follow up the fourth ever Destructoid Draws: OC Mega Man Robot Masters. That one was something special. We were able to let our inner kids loose — and it…]]></summary>

In this interview, we talk with Tony about what MultiVerus is, how it is to work with Warner Bros on the project, philosophies on its core combat designs and business models, and much more. 
Game Informer: Can you tell us about MultiVersus? What’s the quick pitch of it?
Tony Huynh: MultiVersus is a cooperative platform fighter. It's free to play. And it's a game that has a lot of the barriers removed, that's really easy to pick up, but also a really smooth, gradual mastery curve into the game. Its focus is on cooperative team-based gameplay.

We recently discussed the best Kingdom Hearts characters, and, surprisingly, several of us excluded Sora from the cream of the crop. However, a defender propped up Sora’s one defining good trait: his overwhelming positivity. In response, I jokingly said if optimism is all Sora offers, he should be replaced by a superior beacon of positivity: Ichiban Kasuga, star of Yakuza: Like a Dragon. We had a good laugh and moved on, but the idea lingered in my brain. I need this to happen. 
I’ll preface my next statement with this disclosure: I like Kingdom Hearts. Now that blowback immunity is activated, I think Sora is lame. He’s a good kid with a great heart, and he’s fun to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever wondered if people in the world of Star Wars play sports that don't involve racing repulsorcrafts, we now know that they play at least one: Blitzball. 
No, you didn’t misread that – it says Blitzball, you know, the underwater hockey-like sport played by Tidus, Wakka, and others in Final Fantasy X. That’s because in the canonized novel Star Wars: Brotherhood, which is about the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a reference to Blitzball being played in a local lake is made. How do we know it’s the Blitzball from Final Fantasy X? Well, the author of Brotherhood, Mike Chen, is the person who revealed this fun detail, as reported by GamesRadar. 
#6: There's a reference to a sport called Blitzball played in a local lake. Blitzball is basically underwater hockey played as a minigame in Final Fantasy X. As a former NHL writer, I freaking loved Blitzball and spent hours winning leagues. pic.twitter.com/uad4uIMcrA
May 17, 2022
As you can see, it seems Chen was a big enough fan of the sport that he included a reference to it in his canon Star Wars novel. Does someone have a lightsaber that looks like Caladbolg, though? 
If you’re interested in other Brotherhood easter eggs such as this, Chen has an entire thread dedicated to them on Twitter. 
For more about Star Wars, watch the new trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is the sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and then watch this new Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 2 trailer. After that, read our breakdown of all the new details we learned about The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, a new series starring Jude Law.

GTA V is as prevalent today as it was in 2013, so when the new-gen editions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were released in March, I decided to finally give it a go. And, unsurprisingly to most reading this probably, it lived up to the hype. So much so that I’m still playing it today, more than two months later. I love playing through the game’s …]]></summary>

As Squid Kids will be fully aware, the unique, bubblegum score of the Splatoon series is an important and distinct part of the online arena shooter series. This weekend, Nintendo dropped a funky-fresh sample from the upcoming Splatoon 3, giving us a sneak peek at the apocalyptic sequel's vibe.
As performed by in-universe garage band Front Roe, "Sea Me Now" is perhaps a little more Orange County than we are used to hearing from the sticky-icky world of Inkopolis. The new track has a distinct pop-punk sound which reflects the chaotic, graffiti-filled hues of a landscape wherein all of the rules have been abandoned. Don't worry, the utterly bizarre vocal style remains, weirder than ever.
Featuring a rockier vibe than Splatoon 2's more Hip-Hop oriented themes, it seems as if Splatoon 3 will feature a brand new sound accompanying its brand new look. Clearly, the new sequel will be going for a somewhat more anarchic vibe than its predecessors, (as anarchic as post-'00s pop-punk will allow, at any rate). This is all well and good, but I still wanna see my gals Pearl & Marina somewhere in the mix. I'm sure they'll be making a welcome cameo appearance at some point.
Splatoon 3 launches September 9 on Nintendo Switch.

This category features games where two groups face each other, but each side has unique, sometimes wildly disproportionate, skills and goals. As evidenced by many of the year’s recently released and upcoming titles, like Evil Dead: The Game, IllFonic’s Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleased, and Dragon Ball: The Breakers, the genre is seeing a resurgence. There’s no shortage of asymmetrical games you can jump into right now if you want to hone your skills or build up anticipation for soon-to-be-released titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I'm happy to report that game is now out in early access. It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be honest, I found Computex 2022 kind of underwhelming; this is usually the biggest event in the PC gaming hardware calendar, and had returned to Taipei after an all-remote 2021 show, but ended with only a smattering of major announcements in the bag. We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off an exciting weekend of tons of news from Star Wars Celebration 2022, including the reveal of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and details about The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, a new trailer for Season 2 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch has arrived. 
In it, we get new looks at the Bad Batch, of course, as well as Darth Sidious aka The Emperor and Wookiee Jedi youngling Gungi. With a look at Gungi, we now know that he survived Order 66, which sought to kill and end the entirety of the Jedi. The trailer also reveals that we can expect Season 2 of The Bad Batch to drop onto Disney+ this fall. 


As you can see in the trailer above, the titular Bad Batch of heroes are still doing their thing, searching for what they want to do now that they’re free. Of course, meanwhile, Sheev Palpatine’s empire is on the rise and the crew will need to deal with that while extending their helping hands to others. It looks like they’re after new allies, too, which hopefully includes Gungi. 
For more about Star Wars, read about the newly announced series, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, which will star Jude Law, and then read about how the Rogue One prequel series, Andor, will hit Disney+ in August. After that, check out the first ever Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or just Supermassive mistakes?
2K Games has released an overview trailer giving us a look at its incoming cinematic horror title, The Quarry. The creepy-looking teen adventure is edging ever closer to its June 10 release date, when it will bring a suspiciously familiar tale of camp counselors in peril to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGVj5yMfOgo
Developed by the horror maestros at Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology), The Quarry will once again task players with guiding a party of hapless heroes as they attempt to survive a night of fright in a deserted patch of woodland known as "Hackett's Quarry." Stalked and hunted by a sinister, bloodthirsty force, it will be up to you to make the kids' choices for them, in a branching narrative path that will decide each character's ultimate fate.
2K Games is shining a light on the "Hollywood" quality of The Quarry, which uses cutting-edge facial capture and "filmic lighting technology" to present a quality movie-like experience. In addition, The Quarry boasts a recognizable cast of stars including David Arquette (Scream), Ariel Winter (Modern Family), Justice Smith (Jurassic World), Brenda Song (Dollface), Lance Henriksen (Aliens), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street), and more.
The Quarry launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 10.

Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion's key features work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone has that Elden Ring boss they really enjoyed facing off against, even if they kicked your butt over and over again, including the game’s director and From Software CEO Hidetaka Miyazaki. 
His favorite boss is Starscourge Radahn, according to a new Xbox Wire Japan blog post, as translated by IGN. As for why, the famed director cites Radahn’s alluring design as a character in The Lands Between as well as the festival surrounding him. 


“It’s tough to decide, but I’d have to say Radahn,” Miyazaki said. “As an individual character, he’s really alluring, and I really like the Radahn Festival situation. There’s a literal sense of festivity and exuberance, but also a unique tinge of sadness and loneliness.” 
He said when he first brought up the idea of Radahn and his festival, “no one on the team took it seriously,” which is extra funny considering this boss is Miyazaki’s favorite. He added that his next favorite bosses after Radahn are Godrick, the Grafted and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. He also said one of his favorite designs out of anything in the game is the 12-fingered Caria Manor hand spiders, because of course (they still give me the heebie-jeebies). 
“Spider Hand is one of my favorite designs,” Miyazaki said in the Xbox Wire Japan post. “It’s something you don’t want to even look at because it’s so horrible. I wonder if the way to overcome your issue is to face it head on and beat it.” 


I was more of a “oohp, there’s one of those hand spider things so I’m going to turn around now” kind of player.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in Town
Fans have spotted new artwork for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II on the Steam dashboard, suggesting that Activision's billion-dollar shooter franchise may be returning to Valve's popular PC storefront.
It has been seven long years since Call of Duty was last available to purchase and play via the Steam platform, last seen in the form of 2017's Call of Duty: WWII. Since then, PC Call of Duty players have been confined to playing the first-person-shooter series exclusively through Activision Blizzard's own Battle.net launcher.
The new image of CoD veteran character Ghost, (as spotted by Redditor Kalinine), has led the community to wonder whether this year's entry will finally see the storied Call of Duty franchise make its return to the Steam Store. It should be noted that the artwork in question was mysteriously removed from the storefront soon thereafter. Given that 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard saw a weaker performance than the series typically receives, perhaps Activision is casting its net a little wider this year.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II launches October 28 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
You can find an abridged timeline of Activision Blizzard's ongoing controversy, investigation, and company response right here.

It's a Wordle-like in which you begin with a four-letter starting word and must enter a new word which changes just a single letter. So if the starting word is AHEM, as it was yesterday, you could change the first letter and enter THEM. 

From there, you have 44 seconds to chain together as many new words as you can, with plenty of other twists to make it more challenging.

Originally released in 2015, Touken Ranbu is a free-to-play browser game where players take up the role of a Saniwa who has the power to turn historical, mythical, and even a few imaginary swords into pretty boy warriors known as "Touken Danshi". The Danshi are mankind’s greatest weapon against the History Retrograde Army, a group of absurd-looking skeletal bugs that are traveling backward in time to change the course of history. As the Saniwa, it is up to you to protect the historical timeline by sending your Danshi back through previous eras of Japanese history to defeat them, even if it means restoring unquestionably cruel moments from the past.
The game was given an international release just last year, which is when I first became acquainted with it. But …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cubic Conundrum
Hamster has returned to the back catalog of veteran publisher Taito for this week's Arcade Archives entry — so get your brain in gear, as the classic cube-based puzzler Flipull has returned on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to arcades in 1989, before finding its way to a wide variety of home computers and consoles, Flipull, (or "Flipull: An Exciting Cube Game"), is a unique take on block-busting, tile-switching puzzlers of the time, and tasks the player with guiding a cute blob character up and down a ladder, throwing out symbol-covered cubes in order to clear out a horizontal playing field. The aim is to clear out rows of matching cubes, while then finding fresh chains for the spare cubes that are left behind. your only enemies are the clock, and some often dizzying background imagery.
This gameplay is better demonstrated in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro MGV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw3OukUwYJw
When I first saw Flipull referenced as this week's Arcade Archives release, I had no idea what it was, but once I realized that it was renamed "Plotting" in the west, the memories came flooding back. I certainly remember Plotting, (and Taito's very similar tile-matcher, Puzznic), from my early gaming years. The cute puzzler is one of those gaming memories that remains locked away in the subconscious until a familiar flyer, magazine advert, or box art image magically opens up some long-discarded file in the brain. It's good to see it again after all of these decades.
Flipull is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed a sneak peek at an upcoming music track from Splatoon 3. Nintendo describes "Sea Me Now" by in-universe band Front Roe as having "a melodious, punkish sound" that has been "swimming up the charts in Splatville lately." True to the description, the track veers closer to what we had in the first Splatoon's soundtrack, though with decidedly more of a punk-rock edge.
You can listen to "Sea Me Now" by Front Roe below.


The Splatoon series has long been known for its music, even including its in-universe artists as main characters. In the original Splatoon, pop duo Callie and Marie (AKA the Squid Sisters) ran down the news at the start of each play session, while Splatoon 2 introduced us to Pearl and Marina (AKA Off The Hook). We don't know who the figurehead announcers of Splatoon 3 will be as of this writing.
Splatoon 3 comes to Switch on September 9. For more on what this third entry in the franchise brings to the battlefield, check out the latest gameplay trailer here or learn about its improvements on the series' wave-based cooperative mode, Salmon Run: Next Wave, here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video Gameography is on hiatus this week, but in the interim, we'd like to announce the next season officially. 
Season six of Video Gameography will chronicle one of the most stylish franchises around: Devil May Cry. Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to create an installment of another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or "Stylish Action"). In this new season, we'll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of the DMC titles, including Ninja Theory's reboot. Dante, black-haired Dante, Virgil, Sparda, Trish, Nero, Lady, V; all of your favorite characters are going to be there! Here's the complete list of games we'll be talking about in the coming weeks:
Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 2
Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening
Devil May Cry 4
DmC: Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 5
Video Gameography is a podcast hosted by Game Informer Associate Editors Marcus Stewart and John Carson. Each season is a deep dive into a specific video game series, with each episode exploring the year of release, development, and narrative for a single game in that storied franchise. We're joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. 
Last season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games. Check out the episodes for Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades to catch up on the show before we initiate our Devil Trigger and take a stab at Devil May Cry. 
Listen and subscribe to Video Gameography on your favorite podcast service. If you enjoy the show, don't forget to give us a five-star review, and make sure to let us know what you enjoy about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords is coming to Switch on June 8. This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You'll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.
The Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.
We recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying "Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables."]]></summary>

He starred in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order alongside Cal Kestis, will be in the just-announced sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and may have even been in an episode of The Book of Boba Fett. This adorable droid is now getting the brick treatment with a Lego set launching this August.
Lego announced this BD-1 set at Star Wars Celebration and showed off what it can do. The set consists of 1,062 pieces and is a part of Lego's recent droid line, which consists of R2-D2, D-O, and a Probe Droid. BD-1's legs move, his head tilts, and you can open a tray that holds healing cannisters. Lego also included a display plaque that comes with a BD-1 minifigure. Now all we need is a smaller set that gives us a Cal Kestis minifigure. The BD-1 set retails for $99.99. You can see it in all of its glory in the images below:
Lego also gave us our first look at a forthcoming set based on Andor, a new Disney Plus series slated to release later this year. This set comes with minifigures of Cassian Andor, Luthen Rael, and inspector Syril Karn. The Mobile Tac-Pod is piloted by Karn.]]></summary>

Batgirl AKA Barbara Gordon is one of Gotham Knights’ four playable characters alongside Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood in a story that sees the Bat family defending Gotham after Bruce Wayne’s death. In the 1988 comic story The Killing Joke, Barbara is famously shot through the spine by the Joker, paralyzing and confining her to a wheelchair for many years in which she lent tech and information support to Batman as Oracle. In DC's 2011 New 52 comic reboot, Barbara regains her mobility due to an experimental surgery followed by physical therapy/training.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SPOILERS AHEAD!
Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus, you should avoid going any further. The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it's unlike anything we've seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year's Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.
These announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.
The trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.
Hasbro's animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA's head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.
Hasbro's second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA's back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.
Hasbro's final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid's personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.]]></summary>

EA and Respawn Entertainment have officially revealed the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order. This new title will continue the story of force-wielder Cal Kestis in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
A brief teaser trailer was shown with the unveiling, which you can watch above. In it, the odds seem stacked against Cal and what may or may not remain of his crew from Fallen Order. Of the known characters, only Kestis and his trusty droid BD-1 make an appearance in the footage, though their cohort Greez's ship, the Stinger Mantis, is seen from the cockpit, empty and in a bad way in a desert. Other notable characters are the potential antagonist who narrates the trailer…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Fortress 2 remains an extremely popular game with a large active player base, but the last couple of years has seen it overrun by aimbots. A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. 
Yesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: 
TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.
May 26, 2022
Valve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.]]></summary>

Evil Dead: The Game is a faithful adaptation, full of subtle and not-so-subtle homages to the classic horror series. You can visit iconic sites like The Knowby Cabin, wield boomsticks and chainsaw prosthetics, fight off a possessed severed hand, play as your favorite cast members, or command armies of Deadites as the series’ antagonist, the Kandarian Demon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Jurassic World: Dominion opens in theaters in two weeks, we’ll see what happens when dinosaurs walk among us. Odds are most humans will be turned into tasty dinosaur snacks, but we probably won’t go down without a fight. Jurassic World Evolution 2 players can download a new expansion that adds some of the movie’s new dinosaurs to their parks on the same day. The Dominion Biosyn expansion adds the Gigantosaurus, Dreadnoughtus, Pyroraptor, Quetzalcoatlus, Therizinosaurus, and the long-overdue Dimetrodon.
The Gigantosaurs’ behavior in Dominion is apparently modeled after The Dark Knight’s Joker. This odd inspiration point was revealed by the movie’s director Colin Trevorrow in an interview with Empire Magazine. “I wanted something that felt like the Joker,” he said. “It just wants to watch the world burn.” We’ll have to wait to see just how much of that destructive quality comes out in the game’s version of the beast.
The arrival of dinosaurs is just a tiny part of this expansion, which offers a new ‘what if’ campaign inspired by the forthcoming motion picture. This campaign allows players to add new buildings to their parks, as well as a variety of new species, some of which are feathered. Existing dinosaurs will also get new skins. The new story unfolds through a variety of characters, including Claire Dearing (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard), Dr. Alan Grant (voiced by Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (voiced by Laura Dern), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott).
Other new features for the park include an underground Hyper Loop transportation network, invisible fences, and new vehicles and decorations. All of it can be used in the Sandbox.
Frontier Developments calls this expansion its biggest yet, and it’s slated to release on June 14.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends and loved ones will agree, I have big “background character” energy. If I lived in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn’t be a Jedi or a Sith inquisitor. I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

        <updated>2022-05-27T14:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced a new State of Play scheduled to air next Thursday, June 2 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. 
The PlayStation Blog states the event will run for 30 minutes and showcases “exciting reveals from our third-party partners.” The post doesn’t mention first-party at all, so it sounds like we shouldn’t expect updates on games like God of War: Ragnarok, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, or the rumored remake of The Last of Us.
Sony also teases that viewers will get a “sneak peek” into PlayStation VR2 games. Just yesterday it was confirmed the headset will launch with over 20 games. The only announced title is Horizon: Call of the Wild, though that project may not appear if the event is highlighting third parties. At that point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what PS VR2 software we’ll see.
The last State of Play took place in March, which brought the reveals of games like Valkyrie Elysium, Exoprimal, and Gundam Evolution. Given that this could be Sony’s only real presence during June’s onslaught of game showcases, it hopefully has some heavy-hitters, even if they won’t be coming from its first-party studios. 
We recently shared our own predictions on PlayStation reveals this summer during this week’s Game Informer Show podcast. What do you hope/expect to see at State of Play? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word that comes to mind is "slick". In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I've seen for ages.
It's more than just stylish, too. As I've mentioned before, I'm bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I'm not going to do a pun about the name. I'm not. I'm definitely not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I finished Yakuza: Like A Dragon and felt a little bit lost. You know the feeling, right? When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

First debuting in 2005 on Nintendo's GameCube, the Mario Strikers series has developed a cult fan base over the last 17 years. However, in the time since that original launch, the series has only seen one additional title hit store shelves. Just two years after the launch of that first game, Mario Strikers Charged launched on Wii, but that's the last we heard of the Mario Strikers franchise until earlier this year when Nintendo announced a new title for Switch, Mario Strikers: Battle League.

I’d only just started this job and was still setting up my email signature at the time (sorry, TF2 community), but thankfully all that shouting has finally been heard by the people who matter most. For the first time in two years, Valve tweeted through the official TF2 account today that they’re finally going to do something about the bots. My inbox is thankful.

But none stood out quite like Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos, a third-person fighting adventure set in a punk-fantasy universe. Despite only the briefest of hands-on sessions cut short by sod's law, I simply can't shake the game from my short back and sides-furnished skull. I think I need someone to roundhouse kick me into reality, before I fall asleep and wake up in the fantastical reams of Zenozoik for good.

Namely, SteamOS 3.2 tweaks the Deck’s fan curve to make it quieter (especially under light load), and adds the option to set the screen’s refresh rate anywhere between 40Hz and 60Hz – potentially saving battery life in exchange for a lower frames-per-second ceiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol is one of the most anticipated horror games in years and happens to be our June cover story. One of the project’s more intriguing aspects was that it canonically took place in the same universe as popular battle royale PUBG: Battlegrounds, albeit in the distant future and on another planet. As of today, that’s no longer the case.
Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol’s creative director, took to Twitter to announce that the game now unfolds within its own story and fiction and not PUBG’s. 
FYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world. It no longer takes place in the PUBG Universe. It was originally part of the PUBG timeline, but grew into its own world. PUBG is awesome, &we will still have little surprises for fans, but TCP is its own world, story and universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No stranger to Star Wars or the annual celebration happening right now in Anaheim, CA, Harrison Ford made a surprise appearance at the Lucasfilm Showcase today, but he didn't show up for a space-faring adventure this time around. Instead, he arrived to promote another Lucasfilm franchise he stars in by the name of Indiana Jones and dropped the big news of a 2023 release date for the next film installment.
Ford's segment started with a musical introduction by longtime Star Wars and Indy composer John Williams (who celebrated his 90th birthday in February) playing him onto the stage. Ford spoke about working on the new Indian Jones film and how it was nearing completion. "I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold," said Ford, according to a Tweet from Decider. "I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus."
Ford says they've almost finished the next Indy film. "I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold," who is also here. "I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus."

Before leaving the stage, Harrison Ford dropped potentially the biggest bit of information from today's panel: Indiana Jones 5 will be released in theaters on June 30, 2023. How about that for a final segment surprise?
Right now the plot and title of Indy 5 are under wraps, but the IMDB page for the film is full of exciting faces joining Harrison Ford on the next great adventure. The page lists Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Toby Jones, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more joining the cast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Celebration began today with a panel showing with a showcase of the projects Lucasfilm is working on, and the new Star Wars series Andor had the spotlight after the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi left the stage. Not only was there a brief interview with the show's cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.
The teaser trailer shown is musically paced with anvil-like percussion and throat-singing casting the theme of the footage. Focusing on the growing tension between the rebellious citizens and the overbearing Empire, Andor will depict the five years of Cassian Andor's life prior to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The trailer shows those citizens preparing for conflict with imperial forces while Diego Luna's Andor voices his displeasure with the Empire over the footage. We, of course, see Cassian Andor sneaking around, but also a new look at Genevieve O'Reilly returning as Mon Mothma, who last played this role in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Peppered throughout are shots of a lush forest, a stark white base set in a body of water, and a large futuristic city that is most likely Coruscant.
“We’re going to rewind 5 years back from #RogueOne. We’ve already shot 12 episodes!“ - Tony Gilroy #StarWarsCelebration #Andor
May 26, 2022
The opening panel for this year's Celebration wasn't streamed, but plenty of news has come from the panel via the Star Wars official Twitter account. Executive Producer Tony Gilroy said that 12 episodes of Andor have already been shot for the premiere this fall, and twelve more episodes will encompass a second season that will lead directly into the events of Rogue One.
Andor will be streaming exclusively on Disney+, and its premiere on August 31 will include the first two episodes of the series.

The wait to be reunited with them again, however, will be a little longer than expected. The Mandalorian's third season won't hit this year. The first episode is now officially slated to release in February 2023. 
This news comes from the first day of Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, Calif. The series' creators, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, took to the stage in front of a packed theater to deliver the update. Actor Rosario Dawson also appeared in full Jedi makeup from the set of Ahsoka to reveal it would also be hitting in 2023, but no month was given.
Filoni and Favreau then surprised the crowd with the announcement of a new show called Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. This Disney Plus show is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will star Jude Law. It's yet another project touched by Favreau and Filoni and also has Jon Watts and Christopher Ford serving as executive producers. You can see the official teaser image below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games’ The Quarry launches in just a couple of weeks and serves as a campy (as in a literal summer camp) spiritual successor to Until Dawn. While you’ll be able to brave the cinematic horrors with friends in person on launch day, the game’s online play has been delayed.
The studio tweeted a message stating that it’s delaying The Quarry’s online multiplayer to no later than July 8. That’s roughly a month after the game’s June 10 launch. Supermassive explains the move was made to ensure the rest of the game, such as its single-player and local co-op, is as polished as possible by the release date.
An update on The Quarry's online multiplayer: pic.twitter.com/Bipo0yxp2g
May 26, 2022
The full statement reads as follows:
While a bummer, one would assume Supermassive’s other option was to delay The Quarry entirely, and it chose what it deemed the lesser of two evils. The game stars a group of teenage summer camp counselors who find themselves hunted by dangerous locals and another mysterious threat. Like Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology, players are presented with a myriad of choices that cause the story to branch in several ways – so much so that The Quarry apparently has 186 unique endings. The Quarry stars an ensemble cast that features David Arquette, Lin Shaye, Ted Raimi, Ariel Winter, Brenda Song, Justice Smith, and others. 
The Quarry will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Supermassive recently released footage of the game’s first 30 minutes that you can watch here. Be sure to also read about how you can finish the game without pressing a button.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-26T17:21:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadline is reporting actor Ray Liotta has passed away at the age of 67.
Liotta died in his sleep while filming a movie called Dangerous Waters in the Dominican Republic. According to a source that has spoken with TMZ, there is "nothing suspicious about the death, and no foul play is suspected." The cause of death remains unknown at this time.
Liotta had a prolific acting career. Among his most memorable roles is Henry Hill in Goodfellas and Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams. In recent years, Liotta has had a resurgence in Hollywood with roles in Marriage Story, the Amazon Prime series Hanna, and multiple other projects in the works, including a film called Cocaine Bear and a series called Blackbird, that will, unfortunately, see the light of day without him around. 
Although his impact on the film industry is great, Ray Liotta also made a profound statement in video games, starring as Tommy Vercetti in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. At the time, having veteran Hollywood talent in video games was a novel concept, expanded upon in the years following due in part to Liotta's portrayal of Vercetti. Vice City was an instant hit when it was released in 2002, receiving many awards, including Game Informer's 2002 Game of the Year. It's sold over 17 million copies according to a Take Two earnings report from 2008.
Liotta leaves behind his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nitollo. Game Informer offers our condolences to Liotta's family and friends in this trying time.]]></summary>

Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is "about as big as an Alsatian" and "basically a bin-bag full of girders".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Jurassic World: Primal Ops, dinosaurs once again roam the world, and humanity is learning what it's like to live alongside them. You play the role of a seasoned dinosaur handler who wants to protect the dinosaurs. These efforts will pit you against poachers, mercenaries, and scientists looking to create deadly hybrids. This free-to-play action/adventure experience will release for iOS and Android devices soon.
The top-down gameplay pushes you to rescue and collect dinosaurs, and also use them for battle against other prehistoric beasts and hostile human forces. The dinosaurs can also be used to aid you in battle.  Pteranodons drop supply crates, and the Triceratops can ram through objects.
“Jurassic World Primal Ops lets players immerse themselves in the Jurassic World franchise, allowing them to deepen their connection with dinosaurs in thrilling, new ways,” said Jim Molinets, SVP of Production at Universal Games and Digital Platforms. “The game is reflective of the brand’s signature storytelling, intense action, compelling environments, and diverse characters, and promises to be engaging for new and long-time fans alike.”
The game will feature in-app purchases and features many of the dinosaurs that will debut in Jurassic World Dominion, a movie slated to open in theaters on June 10. Check out the trailer above and the images below to see what awaits you in Primal Ops. If you are in the market for a dinosaurs experience right now, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is quite good and with over 70 dinosaurs to place and interact with within your own theme park.]]></summary>

VGC reports that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra confirmed the creation of the three shows during a recent business briefing. Amazon has the streaming rights to God of War while Horizon is slated for a Netflix release. However, no streaming service is connected to Gran Turismo (see Benji-Sales’ tweet above). There’s no launch date set for any of the shows seeing as how development was just announced.
In other video game adaptation news, the Sonic The Hedgehog 2 movie dropped earlier this week on Paramount Plus. Be sure to read Brian Shea’s review of the film. And when you’re done with that, head here to find out where to stream the best video game movies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We still don’t know when PlayStation VR2 will hit stores, but when it does, it will have over 20 games available on day one, according to Sony. 
Video Games Chronicle reports that Sony Interactive Entertainment president Jim Ryan told investors during a briefing call that,
“Right now, there is a considerable amount of money being spent on partnerships with independent and other third-party developers to secure a considerable pipeline of attractive VR content at the launch of PlayStation VR2.”
He continued by saying, “That energy, that effort, and that money will continue to grow as the installed base of PlayStation VR2 headsets grows also.”
A slide image from the presentation (posted below) states these games consist of both first-party and third-party games. The only PS VR2 title announced so far is Horizon: Call of the Mountain, a first-person experience in development at Firesprite and Guerrilla Games. 
Sony formally unveiled PS VR2 in January during CES. The headset’s features include enhanced screen resolution and head tracking, a single cord for easier set-up, and more ergonomically designed controllers featuring haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tempting to make a bunch of jokes about Two Point Campus in the vein of, "A nudist knight and a wizard studying the dark arts? Sounds like my freshman year!" and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It's also tempting to say something like, "You know Two Point Hospital? It's like that, but at a university," but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called "Collision." This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.
The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.
Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.
If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.
If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.
What do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?]]></summary>

I can't wait to see Ewan McGregor reprise the role of Obi-Wan and hope Hayden Christensen gets the chance to be the version of Darth Vader that brings fear to the Jedi ranks. I'm also eager to see the Inquisitors in a live-action format. Rupert Friend is suiting up as the Grand Inquisitor, Sung Kang is The Fifth Brother, and Moses Ingram is The Third Sister, who we also know is named Reva Sevander. Reva is everywhere in the early merchandising announcements, perhaps implying she is one of Obi-Wan's significant threats.
Hasbro is also placing Reva front and center in three different action figure series. Yesterday, the toy manufacturer showed images of Reva as a Black Series, Vintage, and Retro action figure. She comes with her unique double-bladed lightsaber in all variations, which can split in two. More information about these figures will be made available this weekend during the Star Wars Celebration. For now, you can see the announcement video and images below:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, "No, see, it's actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!" There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn't love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.
I'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

        <id>118280</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/26/ps5-shortages-expected-to-stabilize-and-overtake-ps4-sales-by-2024"/>
        <updated>2022-05-26T12:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that the PlayStation 5 is frustratingly elusive for millions of Sony fans around the globe. In Fall 2021, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki outlined plans to invest more heavily in console semiconductor shortages linked to the pandemic. But according to Eurogamer, component scarcity isn't the only thing catalyzing the new-gen deficit. The Russia-Ukraine war has also affected part inventory. In a financial presentation conducted yesterday, Sony CEO Jim Ryan stated that PS4 sales continue to be higher than those of the PS5. However, the shortages are expected to stabilize and overtake PS4 sales by 2024. 
In the image above, you can see the PS5 projections. In year one, the PS5 outsold the PS4, in year two, it undersold the PS4 due to supply constraints, in year three, the gap is expected to close, and by year four onwards, the PS5 is expected to overtake its predecessor again. This, of course, won't be easy. Sony has two plans to help expedite the gradual sale increase: source several suppliers for greater stability and facilitate logistical negotiations to maintain optimal delivery routes. 
Matt Miller awarded the PlayStation 5 an A- in his review of the console and stated:
"The PlayStation 5 is an incredibly powerful and sophisticated piece of gaming hardware, sometimes virtually eliminating the tedium of loading screens that have plagued console gaming for decades. Games look amazing thanks to new lighting techniques, especially on 4K displays, and a proprietary sound engine ensures an equally arresting aural experience. While its outward aesthetic is attractive, it's also overpowering, and the design won't please everyone. A slick dashboard is easy to use and smartly designed and values what's important to you, most especially your leisure time."
Hopefully, we'll all get our hands on the new-gen Sony console we deserve as we grow closer to a future where stronger hardware takes precedence.

Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's shaping up to be a great weekend for people who like getting lost in a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars Celebration kicks off tomorrow in Anaheim, Calif, and the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi hit Disney's streaming service a day later. Obi-Wan will also join the fight in Fortnite tomorrow night. And we should really start celebrating Star Wars right now, as today is the anniversary of A New Hope's theatrical release.
If past Star Wars Celebrations are any example to follow, we'll see plenty of collectibles announcements over the weekend. Some toy manufacturers are getting out in front of the potential bombardment of news. Funko just announced the first wave of Pops based on the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and I'm guessing we'll see more in the days to come.
This line offers a new version of Obi-Wan, looking slightly older than he did in Revenge of the Sith. We're also getting a menacing sculpt of Darth Vader, who looks exactly like you would expect. The only new character is Reva, the Third Sister, looking ready to ignite her lightsaber. A deluxe version of Obi-Wan riding an Eopie is also on the way. All of these figures are expected to hit retailers in October. You can see them below:]]></summary>

And now the game's first season has - *double checks* - finally arrived.
So, Ollie, Liam, and I strapped on our skates and jumped into a few games to see how it's getting on. Ollie had some experience with the game before, while Liam and I went in totally blind.

If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

It’s a mystery, then, why the French Resistance constantly hand him objectives that require close-quarters combat. “Sneak into this chateau,” or “blow up that radar,” they say, probably with a smirk assuming that he won’t be able to pull it off.

This was done to give the public more insight into where the "free flow of information" on the Internet is blocked. At the time Google spotted a massive increase in takedowns, but the real surge was yet to come.

It's fully 3D space-ish combat, this time with colourful stylised levels, somewhere between technicolour neon and oddly minimalist. I don't want to start on a downer so let's say that my opinion of it improved the more I played it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampiric survival sandbox V Rising has, according to Steam’s player counts, entranced itself quite a following. That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. 


I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano's development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

This isn't the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ‘Destined For Destruction’ update for fantasy action RPG Lost Ark arrived last week but it appears to have introduced a bug that makes the cursor stick to part of the UI and prevents clicking. Reddit user Sagezu was flummoxed by the bug over the weekend and shared their woe at crashing out of Lost Ark’s first Legion Raid, Valtan, which arrived as part of the May update. Judging by the comments, many other Lost Ark players were encountering the same bug.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very sorry to anybody who knows me in the real world, but I’m never happier than when I’m playing a town simulator. When fully in the grips of My Time At Sandrock, my little made-up computer game life is all I can think about. My relationships with real humans fade into the background, to be replaced by an altogether more fulfilling kind of relationship, one based entirely on gifting the same jar of honey to a cartoon character over and over again until they admit that they love me.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220522/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

Which makes it a little odd that the marquee change in patch 4.1 is the removal of a feature: Breakthrough mode can no longer be played with 128 players, and is now limited to 64. 

Not that Battlefield 2042's website or digital store pages have been updated to reflect that change yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wetlands, the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, is ready for public testing!
This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
