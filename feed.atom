Breaking: Nintendo has added three more classic games to the Switch Online Game Boy Advance library. They include Densetsu no Starfy 1,2 and 3. Enjoy!

Densetsu no Starfy – No sleep ’til Pufftop! A sudden storm has caused Starfy, prince of the floating sky kingdom Pufftop, to plummet from his lofty home into the sea below. Luckily, he is rescued by an old lobster named Lobber who sets the adorable hero on a grand journey back to Pufftop. The way home is full of dangers, though, and Starfy will need to employ a variety of abilities – including Star Spin and Glide – and vehicles like the mighty Mole Tank, to overcome the challenges that await. The legend begins here!

The 2017 release Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been an absolute juggernaut for Nintendo during the Switch generation and if you needed a reminder about just how successful it's been, here's a little fun fact.
The 61.97 million units shifted as of March 2024 actually means this single game has now surpassed the lifetime sales of Nintendo's classic home console NES hardware. As highlighted by Did You Know Gaming creator Shane Gill, Famicom / NES sales topped 61.91 million units worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Board games are brilliant. They make for the perfect night in with friends, family, or just that one really special person in your life. With a board game, you're free to have a conversation and play a game without anyone in the room being glued to a screen, and really feel like you're getting to know one another. 


However, board games can also be an expensive hobby. Many aren't cheap, and going out to a board game café isn't really an option when you're at home, bored, and want something to do that isn't turning on a console or movie. That's why it pays to grab them while they're cheap, and one of the best times is right before Amazon Prime Day. These early discounts can save you a bundle of cash, money you'll need for what you've been holding out for in that sale.

While you work your way across the vast playable space, killing as many of them as possible, you might be wondering what the point of it all is. That's why seasons matter. 


Seasons may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you jump in and play Once Human, but they won't be far from it once you've spent a few hours in its lush world, cutting down strange creatures and other players eager for your gear. Developer Starry Studio has explained exactly how seasons work in the game, how the initial one will fit into the game's launch, and what to expect from them in the future.

        <updated>2024-07-11T21:52:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Day is set for July 16 through 17, and with it, plenty of deals. There are a handful of delights planned for the video game department as well, with Prime Gaming set to offer a big freebie to its Prime subscribers.


Rocksteady Studio’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was released earlier this year in January, and it is already set to be a part of Amazon's major free giveaway. The game is one of three freebies Prime Gaming will offer its members; Chivalry 2 and Rise of the Tomb Raider are the two other rewards for Prime members, and all three games will be free to claim via the Epic Games Store from July 16 at 12 a.m. PT until July 18 at 12 a.m. PT.




While it is not new for AAA titles to be part of giveaways, it does come across as somewhat surprising to see Warner Bros. already deciding to place the game in a major giveaway. The decision can help bring new players to Suicide Squad, which could be crucial for the game given its player count history and Warner Bros' disappointment. Moreover, the Season 2 content roadmap looks packed, and the sudden surge of new players and steady content might give a new lease of life to the game set in the Arkhamverse.


Prime Gaming has been on a roll since June, giving away a handful of titles so far. The following games received staggered launches, leading up to the reveal of the main Prime Day game launches, and include the likes of heavy hitters such as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. These games can still be claimed on Prime Gaming: 



Deceive Inc.


Tearstone: Thieves of the Heart


The Invisible Hand


Call of Juarez


Forager


Card Shark


Heaven Dust 2


Soulstice


Wall World


Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood


Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge


Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II


Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX


Samurai Bringer

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Vesgitial Organ is a rocket launcher in The First Descendant that has matched the likes of other popular weapons like the Tamer. It’ll work exceptionally well for bossing and mobbing, though you will go through its ammo rather quickly.


How to get the Vestigial Organ in The First Descendant


To get the Vestigial Organ in The First Descendant, you have to play the Miragestone: Vulgus Strategic Outpost Zone Recon Mission in the Agna Desert region. It has a 50% chance to be given to you upon completing the mission. 


This mission isn’t always readily available, so make sure the mission timer hasn’t started yet. Be there within five minutes before the event starts.

Best Vesgitial Organ farm


The best way to farm the Vestigial Organ is to repeat this mission or, after completing it, kill mobs of enemies in hopes that it’ll drop. Luckily, you can visit this mission once you get to Hard mode and it’ll be a higher level than 50. 


You can hold onto the weapon until you can start getting level 100 gear. It’ll be easier that way so you can use Weapon Level Transmission to not have to farm for a new one. Though, with steep resource costs, it’s better to just farm a fresh one once you’re at that level.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Best rolls for the Vesgitial Organ in The First Descendant


The following are the best rolls to have for your Vestigial Organ. You can either find one with these rolls or use the Weapon Readjustment feature at the Workbench. 



Explosive ATK


Elemental ATK


Weapon Change Speed


Attribute Status Effect Trigger Rate



The Vestigial Organ does not have a good critical hit rate or damage, so it’s pointless to roll for that or apply mods that increase it. With raw damage and increased elemental stats, this launcher will then be good to be an all-rounder weapon.

Dogen is found on the new Sakurajima Island included in the update, specifically around the Dancing Sakura Shrine. This is the only area in all of Palpagos that Dogen spawns, so this is where you need to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GreedFall 2, the upcoming RPG title from developer Spiders, is set to enter Early Access period on Steam on September 24, 2024. Spiders and publisher Nacon revealed a new release date announcement trailer, featuring the Early Access release date amid cinematic glimpses.


The developers are planning to reveal more information in August via a new gameplay video, which will show more about what players can expect from GreedFall 2 early access. The early access roadmap was already shown by the developers in March 2024, which gives fans a rough idea about what GreedFall 2 will offer at the start.




Players will get to experience the first chapters of the main quest in GreedFall 2 during the Steam early access on PC. Moreover, players will get to explore locations such as Teer Fradee, Thynia and Uxantis. There will also be some companions available during the early access period. As for future updates during early access, Spider plans on adding new regions, companions, local and main quests, skills, customization, and more.


Speaking about GreedFall 2 overall, the developers have said that the sequel will be “completely new and bigger” with more regions, enemies, quests, characters, skills and more. The developers have said that they decided to opt for early access so that they can receive feedback from fans and provide a more polished game with improvements to combat and exploration. The first game received a fairly mixed reception at launch, so the decision to open up the game for feedback right from the start can be a welcoming start for GreedFall 2's journey.


GreedFall 2 is coming to PC via Steam first, but it will eventually also be released on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

To find Devonia's Hammer, you'll first need to clear the Shadow Keep and head west past the Viaduct to the Ancient Ruins of Rauh. Starting at the 'Viaduct Minor Tower' Site of Grace, head right on Torrent and down into the ancient structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games has apparently cancelled an in-development platform fighter called Pool Party. A report from Mikhail Klimentov (ReaderGrev) claims that Pool Party would have had gameplay similar to Nintendo's Smash Bros., set in the League of Legends universe.


There were around 70-80 developers working on the game before Riot Games sunsetted its development. It's also suggested that Riot Games was working on a platform fighter because they saw potential in building an esports landscape around it.


Joe Hixson, senior communications director at Riot Games, responded in a statement to Klimentov, saying that Riot Games always has a number of projects in “various phases of R&D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year.”


The report also alleges Riot executives were “spooked” after the perceived failure of Multiversus, a crossover IP platform-fighting game from Warner Bros. Though Pool Party was originally envisioned as a "hardcore fighting game," it went through several revisions, including the addition of party game elements and gameplay mechanics which are “casual-friendly”. It has also been claimed that the fundamental changes to the scope and vision of Pool Party left some of the staff frustrated.


The report has also claims that Riot Games offered half of the team working on Pool Party to be reassigned to a different project within the studio, and other developers were looking for new positions within the company. According to Klimentov's source, 10 have still not received an offer nor were part of the internal application process, which could imply they've left the company.


None of this has affected 2XKO however, Riot's publicly announced fighting game. The company is preparing to debut a new demo at Evo 2024, and plans are in motion for a 2025 launch.

        <updated>2024-07-11T20:40:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekly Challenges often feature objectives involving 'Akimbo Kills,' which necessitate close-quarters combat. However, to achieve this, you need to use a specific gun. This guide is here to help you navigate this, providing a list of all weapons capable of Akimbo Kills in MW3.


Which weapons have Akimbo Kills in Modern Warfare 3?


Akimbo weapons allow Operators to wield two weapons in their hands without using ADS. To get Akimbo Kills in Modern Warfare 3, you must customize your weapon in the Gunsmith with the build. Here's a complete list of guns that can be used for this task:



Basilisk


Renetti


COR-45


TYR


WSP Stinger


P890


.50 GS


X12


FTAC Siege


GS Magna


9MM Daemon


X13 Auto


WSP Swarm



You may have noticed that the Akimbo Kills weapons are mostly tied to the Handguns collection. Equip the suitable materials by going to the Rear Grip section in the Gunsmith, showcasing an option for the Akimbo.


The WSP Swarm SMG is the only weapon not a part of the Handguns class. For this, go to the Conversion Kit instead and place the WSP Akimbo Brace Stock. Other weapons, such as the Akimbo Shotgun, could work but may not register for the Akimbo Kills objective.

If you are trying to complete a Weekly Challenge in Modern Warfare 3, you'll likely need to use a Recommended Akimbo-based weapon. These guns will be marked with a fire symbol in the collection. This requirement will sometimes limit your choices, depending on the current season's Recommended guns.


The Akimbo builds will also be locked behind a particular task. For example, the Akimbo FTAC Siege will only be available after you complete two Daily Challenges. Due to the gun's limited range, it's best to use it in small-sized maps like Shipment, Emergency, and Stash House. You can also utilize it in Zombies mode for an extra challenge.

Though The Final Shape left players on a high, the same could not be said for the debut Episode. While Episodes were meant to present an opportunity to break away from the tired conventions of Seasons, the first Act of the premiere Episode, Echoes, felt a lot like a Season with more timegating. Bungie did announce it would experiment with removing time-gates in Episode 2, but the studio also had new stuff to show off for the remainder of Echoes in a preview livestream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For quite some time now, I've seen the concept of hotels pop up in Sims 4 forums, where fans have expressed their desire for it in a new pack. Although it may have seen out-of-reach after all these years, the Lovestruck Gameplay trailer has finally introduced this feature to change up your Woohoo game.


Toward the end of the trailer, you'll notice a hotel Sims can use for sleep or after a romantic night out. This will be a part of Lovestruck's newest Woohoo spots, including a place to get your freak on in a closet.




Once the expansion drops, players can rent a room at the hotel, also known as "Beso Rápido," in the new world. However, it may be linked to a rabbithole event, a mechanic where the in-game camera doesn't follow Sims. The hotel itself may not be customizable, but at least the feature has finally been put in Sims 4. It also seems much more accessible than getting a vacation rental since you can come and go as you please.


The arrival of hotels could lead to a game pack that further explores this building type. I've always dreamed about running a bed-and-breakfast, or maybe even a Suite Life of Zack and Cody-inspired hotel in the Sims world. Maxis Studios already has the basis to make this work, considering that you can be a landlord in the For Rent expansion pack. All it needs now is a hotel system, setting up a few rooms for Sims to stay in temporarily. Additionally, the studio could utilize the employee customization from the Get to Work EP for receptionists, housekeeping, and management. 


While a complete overhaul of hotel features may not be on the horizon just yet, we can wait and see what the Lovestruck EP has in store. The Gameplay trailer did reveal plenty of other content to look forward to, from Cupid's Corner dating app to attraction preferences. There are a few pre-order bonuses, too, to gather more unique items for your collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekly Famitsu magazine recently dropped the reveal for Double Dragon Revive, a 3D take on the classic beat 'em up series. It arrives by way of developer Yuke's, which worked on Rumble Roses, as well as a bunch of WWE games up to 2018's WWE 2K19, among other titles. Now an official website and Steam page are live for the brawler, which is flexing with all its might for a 2025 launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. 


Publisher Arc System Works delivered the first look at the new entry in the teaser trailer below. 




If your first thoughts when a new Double Dragon game is announced go straight to Abobo, don't worry; he's here, even if his head isn't roughly the same size as his torso anymore. Abobo isn't the only musclebound monstrosity gunning for the Lee brothers. Revive promises that good ol' Bimmy and Jimmy will get to face off against "a variety of powerful foes from their past." From the looks of it, the latest entry has retained a sense of humor, so we'll see how many of those classic enemies end up making a revamped appearance. 


Screenshot via Arc System Works


Double Dragon Revive is looking to bring new players into the mix with simple controls and a more modern balance, while also being "more than a simple button-masher." Hey, just try and stop me from mashing buttons!


The announcement mentions that the staff involved have experience working on Arc System Works fighting games, so maybe the combat will go a bit deeper than some other entries. All I need to know is that I can pick up weapons and kick people into refrigerators and dumpsters. More often than not, it's the simple things that keep us going.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you complete weekly quests in Fortnite, you'll find a mix of season-specific challenges and general tasks such as traveling in cars, dealing damage with particular weapons, or collecting ammo. A surprisingly difficult task you'll find is sliding across a vehicle, which, although sounds easy, is much harder to pull off successfully than you'd initially expect.


How to slide across a vehicle in Fortnite


Sliding across a vehicle requires precise movements involving sprinting toward a car, jumping, and sliding across its surface. The easiest way to do this is to find a Whiplash sports car during your match, stand behind it, and get a running start before jumping onto the vehicle. From here, hold CTRL on PC or the right analog stick as you land on the car to slide forward.

Since this is a very specific movement, you may have to repeat it a few times to get the timing right. Your goal is to jump in a way that you land on the back of the car so that, once you slide forward, you'll go right along the entire surface. Landing closer to the front won't count toward the weekly quest, even if you pull off the slide successfully.


Another challenge is ensuring no other players are nearby as you're doing this. A good rule of thumb is to avoid popular landmarks or bosses as you attempt this quest, as other people usually crowd around these spots. Unnamed locations or small gas stations are the way to go, as these often spawn a car or two and have few people visiting them until later in the match. If you do see anyone, quickly pick up a weapon and eliminate them from the match before attempting the slide again.

If you head onto the Switch eShop now, chances are you probably won’t have a good time. Unless you go into it knowing what you want to buy ahead of time, the significant slowdown and copious shovelware making up the majority of the ‘Recent Releases’ section will likely be enough to scare you off long before you discover anything worth purchasing.
There are a lot of games on the eShop in 2024; far more than we’re comfortable with, frankly. It might be difficult to imagine now, but when the Switch launched in 2017 with little more than Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Fast RMX, Snipperclips, 1-2 Switch, and a handful of other software titles, the eShop actually ran pretty smoothly. This, coupled with its simplistic design, actually made the user experience reasonably pleasant. Sure, it might have lacked the personality of the Wii U and 3DS eShops, but it worked, and that’s really all that matters.

Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours. Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

Then, there is also the Riot username that is used to log in to your Valorant account to play the game. While it is possible to change your Riot ID, and the display name, it is not possible to change your username.


The Riot ID, or display name, consists of a chosen name that other players can also see, and it is suffixed by a tagline. This tagline is attached to a display name to create an overall unique display name.


The display name can be anything you like, regardless of whether it is already taken or not, and that is why the tagline exists, so as to ensure that the account can be uniquely identified. You can also change your tagline, but it needs to be unique.


How to change your display name in Valorant



Go to the Riot Account login page.


Log in to your Riot account.


Head to the Riot ID tab.


Under ‘Game Name’ section, enter your desired Valorant display name.


You can also enter your desired tagline in the next field.


Click ‘Save Changes’ to confirm your new display name.



Gamers who play multiple Riot Games titles can choose different display names for all their games. This means that changes made to your Valorant display name, will not alter your display name in League of Legends, or any other Riot game.


It is only possible to change your Riot ID once every 30 days, so give it a good thought before finalizing the change. Also, make sure that the display name does not contain offensive language, as it can lead to a suspension or permanent ban on your account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games is reportedly looking to introduce a new limited-time mode to Fortnite later this season. Reliable leaker HypeX said on Twitter that a melee-only limited-time mode is in the works. The leaker also revealed a list of melee items and weapons that might be featured in the limited-time mode.




Here are all the possible items that would be available in the melee-only Fortnite LTM:



Shockwaves and heals


Grapple Blade


Sideways Scythe


Shockwave Hammer


Nitro Fists


Chains of Hades


Kinetic Blade


Magneto Mythic



A melee-only Fortnite limited-time mode would feature players dropping onto the Battle Royale Island without guns, rockets, or any other form of projectile weapons. However, one fan did raise the question about Magneto Mythic being a projectile weapon, as it can hurl metal shards towards an opponent to inflict damage, but the only answer was speculation that it could be removed.


It would be interesting to see how building structures play into this mode, given that fights would invariably rely on close-combat encounters. Fights in the battle royale can stretch out for quite some time with no projectile weapons in play, and we all know how quickly platforms can be built to avoid fights.


We'll see if this leak fully pans out, but it could be quite an interesting turn of events, if and when Epic fully confirms it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it's not worth doing for random weapons in The First Descendant, creating builds for some of your best weapons can elevate them from great to excellent. Most Modules are only stat boosts, but those stat boosts can make or break these weapons. One such weapon you get early is quite powerful on its own, but only gets much better with the right Modules. Here's the best build for the Thunder Cage SMG in The First Descendant.


The best Modules for the Thunder Cage SMG in The First Descendant


Image via Destructoid.


The Thunder Cage's greatest strengths are in both its rate of fire and attack speed, dishing out endless bullets quickly. However, that means you're constantly contending with reloads and the weapon not always being up to snuff in raw DPS. Rather than upping the damage however, we want to ensure that those clips go out quickly while reloads are far easier to deal with. The following nine Modules should do just that:



Reload Insight


Recycling Genius


Expand Weapon Charge


Fire Rate UP


Maximize Weight Balance


Vibration Absorption


Hawk-Eye


Weak Point Insight


Better Insight



The first five mods are designed with the core purpose in mind. We're adding in fire rate, rounds per magazine, and reload speed so you're dumping a clip into whatever enemy you see. The other four mods lift the weapon in other ways, with Vibration Absorption and Hawk-Eye providing some utility through recoil and accuracy. Weak Point Insight and Better Insight giving weak point damage and critical hit chance respectively.


Who is the best Descendant to pair the Thunder Cage with?


With the right build, Bunny is the best character by far to run the Thunder Cage with. If you're building out Bunny properly, you're adding in electricity damage somewhere since all of her builds are electricity-based. This can help the Thunder Cage's unique passive of making enemies explode into electric bursts. It's a match made in heaven.

Righetti says that at times it may appear that Italy's Piracy Shield blocking system is malfunctioning or ineffective, but that's not true.

Fortunately, the solution is straightforward; force companies like Cloudflare into compliance and prosecute users.

It seems like we're in the age of weird, oft-forgotten platforming mascots making a return. We say that because today, Ratalaika Games announced that "the bat is back!" No, not that bat — Aero the Acro-Bat. The circus performer will be making his grand return on Switch (and all other consoles) on 2nd August 2024.
Originally developed by Iguana Entertainment (later Acclaim Studios Austin) and released on the SNES and Sega Genesis / Mega Drive in 1993, Aero the Acro-Bat stars the titular bat on an adventure to rescue his girlfriend Ariel. Edgar Ektor is trying to ruin the circus — and all amusements as we know it — and our acrobatic bat has to put a stop to his misdeeds. The game also came to GBA in 2002.

        <updated>2024-07-11T14:04:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.]]></summary>

Just when we thought we couldn't be any more excited for Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, Square Enix comes along and pushes our hype levels into overdrive. The remake's official Japanese site has today been updated with new information and screenshots and several Japanese outlets have published extended gameplay footage showcasing the adventure in action.
Let's start with the biggie and take a look at some of the new footage. Six different Japanese outlets have been permitted to share up to half an hour of gameplay and each showcases different elements ‚ so yes, there's a lot to catch up on. Dengeki Online's capture drops us into the game's random encounters from the get-go, Famitsu's contains a good deal of environmental exploration and 4Gamer's shorter clip gives a whistle-stop tour of several locations in bite-sized chunks.

Before Super Mario Maker, there was Princess Maker. Yes, these two series have absolutely nothing in common beyond a shared naming convention and we’re definitely being more than a bit cheeky, but it’s technically a true statement.
Back in the early ‘90s, Neon Genesis Evangelion anime studio Gainax took its biggest swing in the realm of video games yet with Princess Maker 2, a life-simulator game all about raising a young daughter into maturity. It’s a title that was undeniably niche at the time of its release, both in terms of concept and game genre. However, that limited appeal never stopped it from attracting its own dedicated international following. Even decades prior to its first official worldwide release in 2016 with the remaster Princess Maker 2 Refine, this title was understood to be a bona fide cult classic.

This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

Nintendo recently revealed a short, spooky teaser for some sort of Switch game known as Emio. Details are pretty scarce at the moment, so naturally, fans worldwide have begun to analyse the trailer and speculate what it might actually be. Is it a new IP or an entry in an existing franchise? Is it being developed by Nintendo, or is a third-party project funded by The Big N? Is it from Silent Hill 2 developer Bloober Team? Who knows?
Since it's likely we're in for a bit of a wait until Nintendo spills the beans - whether that be mere hours or several days - fans have decided to kill some time by doing what they do best: create some awesome Emio fan art.

Originally launching nearly five years after Ace Combat: Infinity and four years after the 3DS release Assault Horizon Legacy+, 2019's Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown was the first game in the mainline series for over a decade and brought the series back to Strangereal, the franchise's fictionalised Earth stand-in.
Now, five years further on, Bandai Namco is bringing Skies Unknown to Switch in Deluxe Edition form. The Assault Horizon entries on 3DS familiarised Nintendo players with the series' arcade-style flighter combat, but we're very happy to see this particular entry land unexpectedly on Switch — and perhaps a little trepidatious about how this port will hold up on the hybrid system.

And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. "This is a mature RPG," she tells me.
I only see topless nudity in the character creator, and when I later as…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The open world action game Star Wars Outlaws is coming out next month and developer Massive Entertainment have already shown off some of the speeder biking and laser-trading in various trailers. But recently they've spoken a little more about the player's scummy travels across the galaxy, including how big some of the explorable planets will be, and what happens when you piss off the Hutts. In short, you're going to have a price on your head. Makes sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes "juicy". They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

Yes, yes, it’s a metaphor, but we don’t have time for all that. Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I'm now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.

After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…]]></summary>

According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

Despair, ye time-constrained adults, for your carefully engineered shortage of pocket money offers no bulwark against the onslaught of games that want a slice of your evening or weekend. Today's big release, Once Human, at least features a giant schoolbus on monster legs, together with a less exciting but customisable van that just has wheels. In this open world survival shooter, you are a "Meta-Human" making your way around a landscape corrupted by Stardust, which has warped the scenery and will slowly drive you nuts.

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting "don't write us off yet!" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.

It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

My current mushroom daughter is called Alia. She's a Common Turquoise Truffle. She's got a small pig acquaintance, who so far hasn't tried to devour her, and a cute fuzzy hat, which she stole from outside a church - precise impact on character development still TBC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat: 
And here's a look at the game's avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There's no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world. 
For more Disney, read about how Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed launches this September as well. After that, check out Game Informer's list of upcoming video game remakes.

Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and raised more than $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of Outer Wilds but without using the game's spaceship (what). Let us be glad these folks use their powers for good.

Here time travel means dodging bullets, reversing flubbed hacking, and replaying that conversation you had with the bouncer that got you booted to the curb. “A bloody good time-troubling tactical shooter,” decreed Adam Smith (RPS in Peace) in his review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anti-piracy company Web Sheriff was once known for its off-the-wall approach to tackling infringement. Presumably part of its strategy to get noticed in the market, the company has since matured as an all-round brand protection service. Still, a pair of copyright claims sent to Cloudflare recently are so ridiculously over the top, it's hard to take them seriously. Unexpectedly, Cloudflare responded by blocking URLs on two pirate sites leading to the rarely-seen '451' error.

Two days after returning home from my vacation in Japan, Tokyo-based developer Nagai Industries Inc. released a trailer for its upcoming adventure game, InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…]]></summary>

If the Court of Justice's judgment ultimately favors Sony, the implications are likely to reach far beyond a device designed to interact with a game console discontinued a decade ago. For the greater good, it's a case that Sony must lose and for once in a copyright lawsuit, things are headed in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Zenless Zone Zero, the free-to-play follow-up to Genshin Impact, your character steps out into the city hub and announces their daily ritual - to visit the scratchcard stand. This is on-brand. But, oh no, a wink to real life gambling could be interpreted as a transparent acknowledgement of the gacha genre's psychological claw machine, which is maybe why the developers decided the scratchcard stall should have a sole employee: a very cute dog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We never covered the original Nocturnal, an “intense 3-hour-long action-platformer” from Sunnyside Games, but the Steam user reception seems very positive for a pay-upfront game that actively describes itself as three hours long, and the just-announced sequel seems excellently awash with fire, darkness and death. It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

One: it's a mash-up with the first-person survival genre that sees you stranded on an alien planet, a la Subnautica. Two: there is a dedicated coffee cup item from which you can leisurely sip. It's been in early access since 2019 and, hey, it's rather good. We knew developers Coffee Stain were planning a 1.0 release this year. But more concrete details from management have finally trickled down to the little guy. Version 1.0 will hit stores on September 10th, they say. The complete version will include flushable toilets, a "much sought after addition to the game", we're told.

Who thought hip-hop would take it this far?
As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.
Mortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch. The lore of Grand Theft Auto continues to grow, powered by recent GTA Online upda…]]></summary>

A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.
A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more.

Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit.

And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”
Like the original, Monaco 2 is a game about pulling of…]]></summary>

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.
For some years, the “third place” gave a name to a thing that’s been part of our lives forever. If home is your first place, and work is your second, the third place is the other social and gathering hub for your life as part of a c…]]></summary>

Internet bill payers are regular targets, also in Canada where a movie studio painted 30 subscribers as 'authorizers' of movie piracy on BitTorrent. Hopes of a favorable ruling at the Supreme Court are now dead after the studio's appeal was denied. In its place, greater clarity for bill payers and an increased evidential burden for piracy settlement factories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. 
https://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM
June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.

There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wuthering Waves, that recent gacha RPG of anime styling and impenetrable jargonblasting, just didn’t work on the Steam Deck when it launched in May. It also doesn’t work right now. But for one brief, debatably glorious day on June 29th, it did. And thus, Deck owners who’d persevered through a slightly fiddly installation process (explained here by YouTubesmith Deck Wizard) could finally take their first joyous steps into Wuthering Waves like a David Hasselhoff-buoyed East German in 1989.
Unlike the Hoff, it wouldn’t last. Within hours, Steam Deck players were being booted back out of the game by a hitherto-unseen anti-cheat failure. What gives? Or gave?

Nexon are even now patching the game, and have plied players with in-game bonuses and cosmetics as an apology for the inconvenience.

It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.

A local court soon clarified that viewers would not be targeted. However, letters from LaLiga's lawyers, demanding 450 euros to prevent legal action, run counter to those assurances. That the letters appear to rely on evidence supplied by Spanish ISPs, indicating which of their customers accessed specific 'pirate' servers, is of even greater concern.

        <updated>2024-07-02T14:35:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
For more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.

The reveal trailer features a look at the hybrid racing game, which allows players to select Autobots and Decepticons, use them in combat encounters in Bot Mode, and race as them in each Transformer's Alt Mode. You can play solo or against a friend.
Check it out for yourself in the Transformers: Galactic Trials trailer below: 


"Evil Nemesis Prime has stolen the Prime Relics, which bestow incredible powers on whoever possesses them," the game's description reads. "Now, the Autobots and Decepticons are in an explosive race to recover the relics – the future of Cybertron is in your hands. 
"Choose your character from icons like Bumblebee, Megatron, and Optimus Prime. Speed into action on battle-race circuits, drift and boost to charge up Energon, then unleash devastating special moves in battle. And use your experience to unlock new skills, characters, and skins. It's the ultimate test of your favorite Transformers' abilities, which will decide the future of Cybertron." 
Transformers: Galactic Trials hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 11, 2024.

That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains.

It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've all seen it. The little spinning symbol cautioning players against impatient acts of powering down. "Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed," goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know. I'm a gamer, not an ideas man.

There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. "We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons," the developers say. But wait, isn't there a slide kick in the game already?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may or may not have seen Black Myth: Wukong impressions floating around as of late. Some claim it's not a Soulslike, or is merely Soulslike-adjacent. Some say it's a "boss rush" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

Now the board game's first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it's called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mika and The Witch's Mountain appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of Kiki's Delivery Service, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while "omnimanouevring" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Don't Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy
June 28, 2024
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings.

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. 
"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."

Numbers you’d previously shunned for being too high have suddenly gotten smaller, and purchases have shifted categories from impractical to impulsively justifiable. It’s the Steam Summer Sale 2024! There’s no rush, of course. It runs until the 11th of July. Still, to help you navigate the meatily chummed waters of Sales Lagoon, Horace has decided to reward our combined years of service with a crisp ten bob note each to spend on games. We’ve been bringing up the whole “getting paid” thing for ages, so this is a real win for us. Here’s how we’re all spending that tenner in the sale.

I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact I think it's very good. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it's a great thing, personally.

They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game.

One such piece of missing functionality was the ability to play alone or offline, but an update coming today makes some progress towards fixing that with the addition of "Solo Mode".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first big look at Concord, PlayStation's upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter, during a State of Play last month. And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn't seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…]]></summary>

You are jaded city worker Isla, and you are here to search for your missing brother, who was himself searching for the mystical mountain of Albatroz - locally known as "the walking mountain", for reasons that you will never guess. There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, "Cash in all bounties to play as Boba." However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer's Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that's Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is "to be announced." 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. 
"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads "1.12.2" if it has – select "LOGIN" and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the character creation process for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, players will have to select both a class for their player-controlled Rook and a faction. After customizing much of your Rook's body, including things like a Qunari's horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…]]></summary>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced that Thirsty Suitors, last year’s skateboarding cooking RPG, has joined its roster of games. Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.
Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
