One of my favorite games of 2021, The Eternal Cylinder, was a hidden gem, and I've been wanting a reason to play it again (and have an excuse to bring it up here in hopes of more of you checking it out). My wish has been granted, as ACE Team is planning a Steam release, free upgrades for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and an anniversary update.
You haven't lived until you've curled up in a little mutant critter ball and rolled for life while an endless, seemingly unstoppable cylinder obliterates the world behind you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait is finally over
Ooblets is one of those games that I've been following since it was initially announced all the way back in 2016, and after all this time, it's finally getting a full release.
The idea behind Ooblets is that it's basically Stardew Valley meets Pokémon, where players will tend to their farm but also collect and take care of little creatures called Ooblets. It's yet another game that mixes two of my favorite genres, and the game's bright colors, soothing music, and chill gameplay are likely going to make for one of the most relaxing gaming experiences of the year.
The Ooblets team at Glumberland excitedly took to Twitter to announce that they're finally ready to release version 1.0 of the game, which will be launching on Nintendo Switch, PC (via the Epic Store), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on September 1.
They also thanked all the players who played the game in early access since it went live in July of 2020, further assisting the team in getting the game to its official release. Both digital and physical pre-orders are now available -- the latter also comes with a host of goodies like a map, postcards, and a stick sheet.
https://twitter.com/ooblets/status/1560250546870571009
I can't think of a better way to kick off fall than playing a cozy, adorable little game like this on my Switch. It's been really cool to see the game progress through the development process over the years, and the team's openness on social media gave us an in-depth look at how much work it really takes to make a great game.
There has been some controversy online about how they have handled some situations surrounding the game's development and release, like the announcement that Ooblets would be exclusive to the Epic Games Store upon release. Either way, the game still looks amazing, and I'll be looking forward to playing it upon release.

Reddit may be known for a lot of unsavoury things, but it's also a repository for some of the most entertaining stories and peeks into other people's lives, largely in the form of AITA (Am I The Asshole) and relationship advice posts. These usually unfold with the poster detailing some egregiously horrible/hilarious issue that they're having with their partner, in which it is very clear whether they are/are not the asshole, and then everyone shares it on social media, the end.
The Stardew Valley subreddit hasn't had much news to talk about for a while, since developer ConcernedApe is hard at work on Haunted Chocolatier, so instead they're amusing themselves with fake AITA posts... and I keep falling for them. I keep thinking they're real, and that someone is in a horrific relationship involving way too many chickens, alcoholism, and staying up late mining every night. It's usually not until about 2/3 of the way in that I even notice that they're from the Stardew Valley subreddit!

It looks great, and it now has a release date: September 22nd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gooey alien shooter is taking a little extra time
Squanch Games has announced it's taking a little extra time on its upcoming game High On Life. The cartoonish comedy-shooter will still arrive in 2022, but the team has decided to delay it to December 13, 2022.
Originally set to arrive in October, the Squanch crew says it is working hard towards developing the best experience possible. These extra six weeks will provide some time to squash bugs and tune up.
As part of the delay, Squanch published a special animation as an apology. It's basically a short little sketch, which you can watch below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CdTKrm-_1Q
High on Life is still targeting a launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows PC, with a day one launch on Xbox Game Pass for cloud, console, and PC.
Don't leave me high
Squanch Games is the studio co-founded by Justin Roiland, a co-creator of Rick & Morty and the Hulu series Solar Opposites. So if the humor above feels familiar to you, that's probably why.
Given the game's earlier trailers, High On Life looks to be a mix of sci-fi shooter and Roiland's particular brand of comedy, with a lot of odd and bizarre humor mashing up with alien creatures.
The game's story looks to feature all kinds of bizarre moments, from talking guns to an alien cartel. Plus, selling humans as a kind of drug for extraterrestrial life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SUUeakHKTk
Even though the comedy looks to be a big focus, there's some cool platforming, powers, and gun design happening in the trailers for High On Life. It's a bit out of this world, but Squanch is going to use the delay to squash all the bugs it can and make sure the punchlines land.
High on Life is now aiming for a December 13 launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Not to mention the art style is absolutely adorable, because what's better than a cute little lamb as a cult leader? You can see clear influences from other games and genres, but Cult of the Lamb manages to forge its own path and create a really unique experience.

City Connection, the purveyor of some of history's finest shmups, has announced that Cave classic Akai Katana Shin is getting a re-release on some modern platforms later this year. A digital release will hit PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in Japan on December 15, with a physical edition to follow on PS4 and Switch only.
Originally released in 2010, Akai Katana is a horizontally scrolling shmup that features dynamic visuals, melodramatic lore, and a pulse-pounding soundtrack that are the trademark of the Cave oeuvre. The bullet hell epic tells the story of a band of freedom fighters, sick of having their people sacrificed to the titular artifact, who rise up against their tyrannical oppressors in a bid for absolute freedom.
Check out a preview of Akai Katana Shin from April's FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.
https://youtu.be/yNZTTM3sZG4?t=1997
The new release will feature an authentic edition of the original release, alongside a fully rebalanced edition of the arcade classic complete with widescreen aspect ratio and new in-game mechanics. From these early details, it seems that this 2022 release will be similar to the Xbox 360 port, released by Rising Star Games back in 2011. While there is no official word of a western localization, City Connection has noted that the release will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.
Akai Katana Shin launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

Mane6 has announced a release date for the long-awaited console editions of colorful cartoon slugfest Them's Fightin' Herds. The indie hit will finally make its console debut on October 18, arriving on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. The console edition will be published by Modus Games.
As we have reported many, many times in the past, Them's Fightin' Herds is a one-on-one 2D fighting title that began life as an unofficial adaptation of the smash hit TV series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. After Hasbro's lawyers came a'calling, the show's creator, Lauren Faust, kindly reached out to the team to help with the design of an all-new cast of characters, which allowed the developer to continue the project as an original IP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgaqb7RNb-0
Launching in Steam Early Access way back in 2018, before eventually receiving a full release in 2020, console players have had to sit pretty for almost five years for the console port, but now finally have a date with which to mark their calendars. With a charismatic roster, quality animation, and tight Marvel vs. Capcom-esque mechanics, TFH has successfully built a dedicated community of players, as well as a healthy competitive scene. This community is only set to grow with the arrival of the console port.
Them's Fightin' Herds launches on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms October 18, priced at $19.99. A Deluxe Edition — including a season pass hosting four additional characters, new stages, and a selection of lobby avatars — will retail for $39.99. Pre-orders for a physical release are now live at the Maximum Games Store.

This retro-style side-scroller sees you playing as either a heavily-bearded lumberjack named Timber Man or an anthropomorphised bear named, erm, Mr. Bear (no, the originality of those names is not lost on us) as you jump, hop and chop your way through a series of classic-inspired platformer levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High On Life, the upcoming first-person shooter from Justin Roiland's Squanch Games, has been delayed. 
Originally due out this October, High On Life will now hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 13, 2022. It joins various other games delayed this week like Planet of Lana and Evil West, and for a similar reason: the team needs more time to make this game the best it can be. 
Here's the studio's statement about the delay, in full: 
"We have good news and bad news. Feel free to choose the option you'd prefer to read first; we won't meddle with your free will. 
The Good News: High On Life is still coming in 2022! The team at Squanch Games is working hard towards developing the best gaming experience to hit your screens, and a little extra time to squash some bugs never hurts. With that in mind, our new launch date is set to December 13, 2022. 
The Bad News: It's a game delay, sorry! Because we're making you wait an additional 6-ish weeks, please accept the linked animation as an apology. 
"High On Life will be available via Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows PCs, Day One on Xbox Game Pass, PC Game Pass, and through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Thank you for your continued patience and support." 
As for the linked animation mentioned in the statement above, it's what you can watch below: 
While you wait for High On Life, please find this 500 pound, diaper-wearing alien a wife. Please. He won't leave me alone.

As you can see, it's very Justin Roiland. Enjoy!

In today's update, the studio says it will have a cosmetics shop and seasonal passes, alongside the Seasons system modeled after Diablo III. For each new season, you create a new character and engage with the new seasonal content, allowing players to jump in even if they missed the last season. The first season will be available soon after launch, and the team is aiming for four seasons a year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wallflower Power
Bandai Namco has released its newest update for its excellent 3D scrapper Tekken 7 — Update 5.00 not only brings with it a fresh round of balance tweaks for the entire roster but also welcomes brand new "Wall Crush" tech, increasing a fighter's combo options once they have cornered their hapless opponent.
Every character on Tekken 7's mammoth roster now has maneuvers designated as "Wall Crush Inducing Hit" or "Wall Crush Inducing Guard" moves. When a fighter is able to push their opposition against a solid surface, applying the former will cause a wall splat, which increases the opponent's recovery time and opens them up for further assault. This new mechanic is different from Tekken's standard wall-splat mechanic and is intended as a "bridge" of sorts between combos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrYJ4qHjCsY
If you find yourself on the receiving end of a wall crush, all is not lost. You don't have to necessarily become your enemy's punching bag — wall crush does allow the defending party to block the incoming damage, but the recovery on the animation is long, and the player will likely find themselves stuck in a new blockstring. As such, the new mechanic will force players to be better aware of their surroundings, and utilize side-step maneuvers to prevent themselves from being cornered.
As for the balance changes, there have been tweaks to a whole host of Tekken superstars, including heavy-hitters Lidia Sobieska, Fahkumram, and the endlessly troublesome Leroy Smith. For full details, check out the Tekken 7 Update 5.0 patch notes right here. And Get Ready for Tha Next Battle.
Tekken 7 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

That means one million of us have signed up to this woollen cult, and while this is a fantastic number in the game's first week, Massive Monster isn't settling there. The developer has been listening to our baa-ing and it and Devolver have acknowledged our "struggles" — which means it's aware of the bugs, glitches, and "all manner of fiendish things that must be eliminated".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For PC and mobile
Fresh off the My Nintendo digital press is this Mario summer wallpaper, which can be downloaded now for free.
While some My Nintendo projects cost Platinum Points, this one takes a grand total of zero platinum to download. The reward is available until September 30, 2022 at 4PM ET, which follows in Nintendo's grand tradition of removing Mario content from digital marketplaces forever.
Mario Summer wallpaper sizes include:
1080 x 1920
1200 x 1920
1242 x 2688
1536 x 2048
This just got me thinking though: it's been a while since the last mainline Mario, and we're probably due for one in the next few years (bold claim, I know). I mean, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury kinda counts, but that was over a year ago at this point! It would be cool to see if the follow-up uses the same formula for the Bowser's Fury portion of the game; which felt like a precursor of what's to come.
Or, we could get the safe and relatively surefire Super Mario Odyssey 2. It did incredibly well for Nintendo, and there's plenty of innovation to be had there, from level designs, to things Cappy can command, to mechanical iterations. Some form of multiplayer would be fantastic to see as well.
Then there's the left-field new thing. That's always a possibility with Nintendo!

The studio says it's aware fans loved Seasons in Diablo II: Resurrected and Diablo III and have asked for even more seasonal support. Diablo IV will feature Seasons, and the first will be available soon after launch. Plus, Blizzard will have a team dedicated to Seasons that will bring players up to four seasons a year, each with major new features, questlines, enemies, legendary items, and more. 


"Diablo IV's Seasons are modeled after those of Diablo III," the blog reads. "When a new season begins, all the characters from the prior season are moved to the Eternal Realm, where you can keep pla…]]></summary>

The next Pokemon event involves a Sword and Shield Victini distribution, fresh off of the recent giveaways involving Ash's party.
To celebrate the London, England World Championships, The Pokemon Company did a typical broadcast of the code, which is:
"W0RLD22V1CT0RY"

While several events were only available for 24 hours or less (by the time people pick up on the code), this thankfully has a few days of lead time. This distribution will run through August 21 at 23:59 UTC, so you do have a bit to find your copy of Pokemon Sword and Shield. That's actually the day that the World Championship event ends.
We've been saying it for a little while now, but this could be one of the final distribution events for Sword and Shield as the door closes on that generation. Scarlet and Violet will take over later in 2022, and although there should be a few initial Sword and Shield distribution events, everything will cycle to the newest gen sometime in 2023.
If you're interested in attending the event locally, there's a 2022 Worlds registration page here that has all the information you need. Competition registration is now closed as of August 17, but you can still attend the tournament if you want.

Violence in video games gets better and better as the years go on. I thought it was cool when you could shoot the hats off of enemies in GoldenEye and the guns out of their hands in Perfect Dark but now… wait, those things are still cool. Why aren’t they done more often?
Anyway, video games have done ballistic violence well for decades, but physical violence only seems to have gotten enjoyable around the time of Batman: Arkham Asylum. Or was it Assassin’s Creed? It’s that punch-parry-throw combat that makes you feel powerful and helps the action flow more cinematically. Maybe you’re just smashing buttons when the game prompts you to, but it feels impactful.

One of the most appealing features of the Switch when it was first released back in 2017 was its ability to be played in both handheld and docked mode. But what if there was another way to play? This is a question that seems to have plagued the incredibly talented designers over at Passocade, and what they came up with is surely every gamer's dream — a cocktail table arcade cabinet.
Right off the bat we want to clarify that this device is only a prototype and although Passocade does have other cabinets for sale, there are currently no plans to make it available to purchase. But all the same, how cool does it look? The table cabinet controller offers the big screen experience of the Switch's docked mode with the classic button capabilities of a retro arcade machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(But only three people have completed it)
Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware have proudly announced that their punishing fantasy RPG, Elden Ring, has surpassed an incredible 16.6 million sales since its initial launch on in February of this year. The recent sales figure was featured in the publisher's most recent financial report, as featured by Japanese site Gamebiz.
Launching February 25 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms following a hugely hyped development period, Elden Ring absolutely delivered the high-fantasy, high-difficulty, deep-lore adventure expected by the FromSoft fan community. The beneficiary of high critical praise and extremely positive word-of-mouth, Elden Ring has found itself spinning in the drives of both FromSoft veterans and newcomers alike — well en route to being one of 2022's best-selling and plaudit-winning releases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g
Elden Ring sees players take up the mantle of a fully customizable warrior, who journeys through a dark, open-world universe filled with both steel-swinging opponents and truly nightmarish monsters and demons. As the protagonist progresses through The Lands Between, they will encounter numerous allies and enemies, as they evolve their mastery of magic and combat — all building toward an encounter with the indomitable Queen Marika and the capturing of the realm-conquering title of Elden Lord.
Considered one of the best-reviewed video games of all time, Elden Ring received 10/10 scores from numerous gaming outlets, (including right here on the good ship Destructoid),. This praise has played no small part in the staggering sales achieved over the past six months. How much higher this number climbs over the remainder of 2022 remains to be seen, but the winter award season will likely bolster the overall sales figure some distance.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Cursed to Golf, from publisher Thunderful Games and developer Chuhai Labs, is out today on the Switch eShop. While our own review is still in progress due to receiving the code only recently, a few other outlets have managed to get their own out, so we decided to compile a little round up!
It's worth noting here that it's unlikely these reviews will be based on the Nintendo Switch version, so there may be some discrepancies here and there when it comes to presentation and performance, but this should at least give you a good idea of what the game is all about.

Set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this year, this game quickly grabbed my attention when I first saw its reveal trailer. 
It features plenty of Portal vibes, which is always a plus, and a unique premise: turn back time on objects inside an abandoned space station to determine a way to stop Earth and everyone on it from going extinct. If you haven’t yet seen the reveal trailer, give that a watch here. If you’ve already seen that, you’re probably ready to see more gameplay and fortunately, there's plenty to see in this new five-minute gameplay trailer:


Here’s what developer Stubby Games has to say about the game:

The latest Japanese Charts are in courtesy of Famitsu and it's predictably another strong turnout for the Nintendo Switch.
Coming in at number one, Nintendo Switch Sports managed to sell an impressive 53,900 units, bringing its total so far to 677,393. Meanwhile, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 hold strong at the number two slot, though its sales have taken a pretty hefty dive from the previous week, shifting 39,529 units down from 112,728. It's still a strong number, no question, but it's clear that a game like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has a very dedicated fanbase, many of whom are likely to have picked it up within the first week.

I'm a simple man: I see a Shin Megami Tensei game, and I'm interested in it. Although the cadence has been off and on for various subseries, Atlus managed to muster up Soul Hackers 2, which is a follow-up to the 1997 original — and the first Devil Summoner game in roughly 14 years.
It's a good thing Devil Summoner doesn't miss.

Soul Hackers 2 (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox One, Xbox Series X)
Developer: Atlus
Publisher: Sega
Released: August 26, 2022
MSRP: $59.99
Despite going with a setup that could be considered confusing in some other works, Soul Hackers 2 is surprisingly frank and forthcoming with its narrative conceit.

The Super Mario Bros. movie is the gift that keeps on giving. While the 1993 film was critically panned, it wiggled its way into the hearts of many thanks to its reputation and interviews in the years that followed. The late Bob Hoskins, who starred as Mario, has particularly garnered interest due to how much he reportedly hated working on the film.
But, in an interview from back in the day that's resurfaced thanks to @ATRightMovies, Hoskins apparently didn't even know that the film was based on a video game! You know, one of the most successful video games of all time?

The group of bounty hunters gathers in their favorite bar once more. For the first time, protagonist Ringo pays attention to the lush cherry blossom decoration over the rooftop. Her friends say the real ones are even more beautiful and laugh at the idea of a bunch of Devil Summoners having a picnic and watching the flowers. The friendly mockery leads to a funny yet endearing message: “I think we oughta show Ringo the fun side of being human, don’t you?” Sadly, Soul Hackers 2 doesn’t seem to agree with the sentiment.

It's pretty great, in a 'makes the game actually look the way I had remembered it' sort of way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is arguably one of the most anticipated games locked behind the fiery gates of development hell. The first game dropped over a decade ago, and ever since, zombie-slaying fans have yearned for a sequel. Well, they're in luck. A Dead Island 2: Day One Edition positing was spotted on Amazon with box art, in-game photos, and a 2023 release date. The new info was taken down, but we made sure to grab the images and extra deets for you. 
According to the info on the Amazon page, Dead Island 2 will be available on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. However, current-gen versions of the game don't have web pages yet. The story follows an elite squad that's immune to the infection, meaning we'll be seeing 8-player co-op when the game drops. The full summary reads as follows:
Players must craft zany weapons like in the first game to defeat the seemingly never-ending hordes plaguing the West Coast. Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios' gory adventure allegedly launches on February 3, 2023 (or at least that's what appeared on the listings earlier today before suddenly disappearing). Hopefully, this date holds up/reemerges as we move into the new year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Theia Sky Ruins
A new Pokemon Unite map is on the way, according to a tweet from the game's official account.
While Unite has experimented with extremely uneven events, minigames, or quick maps (five minutes), this is the first time a real new core mode (10 minutes) map has been teased. On paper, it looks like it'll have the same basic two-lane layout as the core one, but with a few changes.
What's different about the new Pokemon Unite map Theia Sky Runs:
Rayquaza is the boss in the middle
Jungling will be different, with new layouts
It has a new aesthetic
It's not a complete departure from the norm, which is honestly OK. When Unite tries to go for far-out wild pitches, it can often miss. So having a layout that's mostly the same but has a complete visual reboot is likely for the best. After a year of playing on the same tired arena, it'll be great to finally get another option.
Of course, details are very slim, as is customary for the game. The only tease we're given is to "stay tuned for future information," so it's unclear how this map will rotate, or if it'll completely take over the original battleground for a while.
As usual, the Japanese Pokemon Unite site has a page upfront beyond the sole tweet from the English account.

Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider sees JoyMasher looking back to Sega Genesis / Mega Drive stalwarts such as Shinobi and other action platformers on the NES, SNES, and Sega systems. It's a bloody, futuristic, robotic side-scrolling platformer which boasts "snappy, responsive and challenging" combat. In motion, the game looks and sounds just like those Mega Drive favourites we grew up playing. Think Robocop but with a ninja robot, and you're not far off what to expect here by the looks of things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inkulinati is a imagiative strategy game first announced in 2020 that brings the distinct art of medieval manuscripts to life. The game unfolds within the parchment itself as players control humans, animals, and mythical creatures to battle it out in turn-based battles that are equal parts thoughtful and ridiculous. Inkulinati has looked promising every time it’s made an appearance, and we can finally see how it's shaping up thanks to an upcoming early access launch. 
This winter, players can dive into Inkulinati on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. The game puts you in the role of Inkulinati, a being capable of using the magical Living Ink to bring illustrations to life. The irreverent battles unfold within an open book as players command units to strategically slice, bludgeon, and even fart opponents into submission to clear the way and topple the opposing Inkulinati. 


In addition to recruiting humans, rabbits, cats, snails, and other critters, you can enlist the aid of real-life literary figures such as Dante Alighieri. Each unit sports its own unique traits with more team members unlocked by playing. Stages promote different playstyles, with some requiring a more tactical approach and others a more aggressive assault. The game features a single-player campaign, and you can challenge friends in 1-on-1 battles.
And for those wondering: yes, this is a different game than Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's recently announced narrative adventure game that shares the same artistic influences.  
Inkulinati will be available first on Xbox and PC, but a Switch version is also planned with other platforms in consideration. The game will be playable at the Xbox booth during Gamescom next week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like the zombies that’ll presumably shamble around in it, Dead Island 2 keeps clinging on to life. Newly posted product listings for the console versions on Amazon US have shed some dying light – sorry – on the eternally-in-development horror game, first announced eight years ago at E3 2014. Here’s that infamous trailer once again, just for old times sake.

Embracer Group, continuing on its apparent mission to become the only company in existence, has been on another shopping spree, walking away with several studios, publishers, and million-dollar IPs in a mighty sweep of its seemingly bottomless wallet.
Announced this morning, Embracer's recent purchases include Lord of the Rings IP holder Middle-earth Enterprises, Maneater developer Tripwire Interactive, Japanese studio Tatsuji, accessory brand Giotech, karaoke hardware company Singtrix, and popular boutique retailer Limited Run Games. The identity of a further acquisition remains unannounced as of this writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Packing 'em in.
As the gaming industry's increasing popularity drives up the demand for consoles, manufacturers have struggled to keep up and are subsequently experiencing worldwide distribution issues due to a number of factors. We have been reporting on the semiconductor shortage for some time now, detailing Switch assembly issues and the company's uncertainty concerning future Switch production numbers. Now, it seems like Nintendo is trying another tactic to reduce costs and keep up the shipment of consoles as best it can.
As reported by Nikkei (thanks, Next News Report), Nintendo will be reducing the size of its Switch packaging by 20% in order to increase the efficiency of its console transportation services. The reduction in packaging will allow Nintendo to make more of the available space when shipping and transporting Switch consoles worldwide, with retailers theoretically being able to fit more items on the shelves subject to supply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix have made a vast array of RPGs over the years, but rarely have they ventured into the realm tactics and strategy games. A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. 
Happily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We're not considering that at this point"
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been relatively accessible since he took over, and this past week, he spoke to financial outlet Nikkei about the lack of a Nintendo Switch price hike for the foreseeable future. Well, that's the plan anyway.
Furukawa noted that they are "not considering" a Nintendo Switch price hike "at this point," with two factors in play. The chief concern is "pricing people out," given that they're aiming to expand their market and play the long game (Nintendo has also comfortably been in a position of being the cheapest mainstream gaming hardware throughout its history).
Another potential way the blow has been softened is through software sales, given that Nintendo also produces games that they want to keep viable with a large install base. Nintendo says that they want to "maintain the momentum" of the Switch so far. The issue apparently isn't with the actual innards of the Switch, but rather that "demand exceeds supply."
So how are they staying the course without a price hike? Furukawa concedes that the "OLED model will continue to be less profitable than our other models," because "costs have undoubtedly increased for shipping not only by air, but also by sea." But he also notes: "The weak yen may be seen as a benefit for Nintendo, since such a large share of our sales comes from abroad, but our overseas promotional and staff costs also go up. We're making more inventory purchases in foreign currencies to counter that."
[Update: Nikkei also reports that Nintendo is reducing their packaging materials by 20% for the Switch, to help with "transportation efficiency," and allow more use of air mail (as well as more shelf space). Right now Nintendo is trying this strategy with the original Switch model."]

Well here's a lovely bit of news for your Thursday morning (or whenever you're reading this) — the adorable and charming Doraemon will be returning to Switch this November in his farming sim sequel, Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom.
Earlier this week, Bandai Namco released a new trailer announcing that the game would be launching on 2nd November. The game takes place on a brand new planet and sees Doraemon and friends attempting to make a new, cosy life. You'll harvest crops, rear animals, and get to use plenty of Doraemon's trusty gadgets. Like a Time Kerchief. Sounds like we could do with one of these.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rave from the Grave?
A staggering eight years on from its initial teaser, there is fresh evidence that zombie-mashing sequel Dead Island 2 is almost ready to grace us with its putrid presence. Online retailer Amazon has opened a new listing for the "Is it even happening?" release, complete with a launch date of February 3, 2023.

The listing includes box art, screenshots, and a game description, which is more than anybody has seen of Dead Island 2 from publisher Deep Silver or developer Dambuster Studios. According to Amazon, the sequel is ready to rock on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, (current and last-gen), and will, once again, see players choose from a selection of characters before engaging in gory, open-world mayhem on the streets of a plague-ridden Los Angeles. The blurb also suggests that the heroes themselves are infected, and can utilize the zombie inside them to unleash further carnage.

It's the best evidence yet that Dead Island 2 is not only still on deck, but is, apparently, mere months away from launch. Originally announced with a memorable teaser trailer at E3 2014, the sequel has since bounced through several studios and has been subject to an array of cancellation rumors. Can the long-awaited title deliver after being mired in development hell? It seems, according to Amazon at least, that we really don't have to wait too much longer to find out.
With Gamescom on the horizon, I would expect that we'll be hearing some official news from Deep Silver in the very near future.
Dead Island 2 is currently in development at Dambuster Studios.

With Splatoon 3 right around the corner, and the Splatfest World Premiere taking place on 27th August, fans are more eager than ever to find out how the third ink-fest will play online. And prominent dataminer @OatmealDome has discovered that the upcoming game will be utilising a new in-house server system for online lobbies (thanks, Go Nintendo!).
This means that Splatoon 3 is now the third game to use NPLN, Nintendo's in-house server system, after Monster Hunter Rise and Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Both previous Splatoon games used NEX, a system that originated on the 3DS and powered a few launch apps like your Friends List.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PvPvE survival battle arena game won't be stuck on PlayStation
Like its predecessor, Deathverse: Let It Die will be playable on PC. The wacky multiplayer survival action game led with PS4 and PS5 as its only platforms, but GungHo Online and Supertrick Games confirmed a PC version in a live developer stream with Uncle Death.
A couple of weeks ago, Deathverse committed to a fall 2022 release window, after previously eying a spring launch. The delay came about in the wake of an open beta test.
"We got a lot of data from the beta," explained game director Hideyuki Shin, "and we're planning to make as many adjustments as we can."
Some of the world-building vibes and close-up combat antics will feel familiar to Let It Die fans, but Deathverse has carved out a different path with 16-player Death Jamboree matches, in which participants try to stay alive long enough to duke it out in the Showdown Zone. All the while, powerful hunters can join the fray, and cryptids — including the chupacabra and jackalope — mingle with the hyperviolent contestants.
[caption id="attachment_340294" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Weapons are important, but don't neglect fashion.[/caption]
The goal is to be bold enough to earn GP (Good Points) and power up, but not be so bold that you bite off more than you can chew and get taken out. Classic battle royale strats.
Let It Die surprisingly ended up having the right stuff — it accumulated millions of players. Whether Deathverse: Let It Die can capture lightning in a bottle again, I'm not so sure, but anything's possible. Having the game accessible on not just PS4/PS5, but also Steam, where free-to-play audiences have a chance to really snowball, feels crucial.
If nothing else, it warms my heart to know that Uncle Death's still a jokester.

So I re-downloaded Splatoon 2, booted it up, and ventured out into the plaza. And within minutes I was reminded that yes, Splatoon is still quite good.

One thing I immediately wanted to check in on was the latest in public plaza art. Splatoon 2 let players draw and set messages for their characters, kind of like a mixture of statuses and forum signatures, that other people could see in-game.

Of all the Marvel heroes, Iron Man has to be one of the most well-loved, thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark. There have been a few Iron Man games over the years, including a 2008 release from SEGA in conjunction with the film (and a sequel in 2010), as well as a well-received VR game in 2020. Even with those titles, it still feels like Iron Man needs a big, bombastic game a la Insomniac's Spider-Man. Well, the dream of an open-world Iron Man game almost became reality, according to a MinnMax interview with Christofer Sundberg, founder of Avalanche Studios (who are best known for the Just Cause series).

MinnMax's Ben Hanson interviewed Christofer Sundberg, co-founder of Avalance, who has since left the studio to start a new company, Liquid Sword. During the interview, Hansen asked Sundberg about the fate of the Iron Man project, which Sundberg revealed as being in development for a year and a half to two years before being canceled due to what he describes as "company politics."


Sundberg reveals that Disney wanted Avalanche to rapidly expand its staff to finish the game under a shortened development timeline. However, he refused, explaining that doing so would have put a massive strain on the studio.

I'd recommend Escape Academy — particularly after today's update, which includes FOV options and a much-needed change to avoid accidental hints.
If you're just here for the field-of-view slider, you can now crank the FOV from 60 all the way up to 120. That also goes for the console versions of Escape Academy — I tested it out on my PlayStation 5 copy this morning. I'll probably settle somewhere in the middle. You…]]></summary>

Sometimes I'm so immersed in my little narrative bubble in the games industry, I forget that there are some people who have never played a story-centric game in their lives! Considering the industry is more flooded with titles to choose from than ever before, it can be difficult to branch outside of the comfort zones of our favorite genres because there's so much to play. No judgment — it honestly just gets me more enthused that I could have the opportunity to introduce someone to some of my favorite games of all time. That's exactly what happened this weekend when I got to chatting to a friend who works in esports (something I know equally little about as she does narrative games). She asked me for a recommendation, and in my excitement, …]]></summary>

Wesley's enjoyed what he's played of the game so far, and he'll tell you why in today's New Gameplay Today.
Betrayal At Club Low is exclusive to PC and will launch on September 9 on Steam and Itch.io. Cosmo D Studios is the developer who is actually just one game designer: Cosmo D. He's the designer behind games like Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1.

Open up this metal box, put a graphics card inside, and suddenly any PC or laptop you connect to it via Thunderbolt gets a substantial upgrade in gaming prowess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet Left With Neighbor
KeokeN Interactive has shared the news that its epic sci-fi adventure Deliver Us Mars will no longer meet its previously expected September 2022 release date. Speaking on Twitter, the Dutch studio rescheduled the launch of its passion project to February 2, 2023, when it will finally arrive on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
"It is important to us that this experience is the best it can be at launch. With this in mind, we’ve collectively made the difficult decision to move the release date to February 2, 2023 in order to ensure that we are able to live up to that ambition," wrote KeokeN in yesterday's statement.
"Whilst we understand this news might be disappointing, we are excited for you all to face the challenges of Mars, traverse its hostile environments, and discover the mystery of the ARKS. Your patience will allow us to deliver the best experience we can."
Those looking forward to the ethereal jaunt to The Red Planet can at least take heart in the additional news that a brand new trailer is set to premiere during the Future Games Show, which is scheduled for August 24 as part of next week's Gamescom festivities. While the last-minute delay is unfortunate, the acclaim afforded 2018 predecessor Deliver Us The Moon suggests that KeokeN will have something special to offer interstellar explorers come launch day.
Deliver Us Mars launches February 2 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store).

thatgamecompany's dramatic and evocative adventure Sky: Children of the Light is now getting set to enchant a whole new community of players, following the news that a PlayStation port is currently in the works.
Originally released on mobile platforms back in 2019, with a Nintendo Switch port following in 2021, Sky: Children of the Light is a fantasy open-world adventure with a heavy emphasis on social connection and cooperative interaction. Players explore a large, abstract kingdom made up of multiple realms. Through engagement with other players and various spirits, the player evolves their flight ability, slowly allowing them to progress further and further beyond the borders of the hub world, "Home."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBQRCHusYyU
Much like thatgamecompany's award-winning titles Journey and Flower, Sky: Children of the Light eschews combat and heavy antagonism in favor of exploration, mystery, and puzzle-solving. A slant on cosmetic items allows players to trade the in-game currency, candles, for various customization items including emotes, accessories, and musical instruments. Sky is currently engaged in its 14th season, with thatgamecompany continuing to build upon the universe it has created with additional lore, characters, and activities.
In a brief statement, the developer expressed its excitement and desire to "extend the circle of light even further" with the new PlayStation port. Though no further details nor a release window were announced, it was noted that the port will feature full crossplay functionality with the Switch and mobile editions. Fans should keep a watchful eye on the official Sky social media channels for more info.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The solo developer behind the excellent visual novel One Night Stand has revealed their next game project today, and it's quite possibly the perfect cross-section of all my interests. It's called Videoverse, and is described as a narrative adventure above love and friendship, inspired by Nintendo's now defunct social network, Miiverse (which all Wii U and 3DS owners know is the single, most wholesome thing to have ever existed in video games). Have a watch of the teaser trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another one bites the dust. If you haven't noticed, a number of high-profile delays have occurred in recent weeks, with many upcoming games pushed into next year. Unfortunately, the promising sci-fi platformer Planet of Lana joins that growing hit list.
Planet of Lana was first announced at E3 2021 with a 2022 launch window. The game stars Lana, a young girl, and her adorable cat-like companion Mui on a combat-free mission to preserve a serene planet occupied by robots and other creatures from corruption. Developer Wishfully Studios wants this cinematic puzzle platformer to make a big splash, announcing it’s pushing the release to spring 2023 to do so. 
Planet of Lana will be playable at Gamescom next week, so attendees have the opportunity to see how the game is shaping up first-hand. The title is slated to launch on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.
If you're losing track of every big game to slip into 2023, this handy list should serve as a nice reminder.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.
We Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.

The studio’s earlier project found players navigating a train on its way through hell, using deckbuilding card mechanics to fight one challenging battle after the next. In Inkbound, the team has held onto the roguelike formula, but almost everything else is going in a new direction.
Players each control a character making their way through a magical world called Atheneum, a place from which countless stories emerge and come to life. Players enter realms defined by books and help to shape and define the worlds and narratives within.

The presentation is generally on par with E3 or Summer Game Fest when it comes to delivering significant news, and we now know a few of the major titles that will appear.
The Summer Game Fest Twitter account revealed that ONL will feature world premieres for Sonic Frontiers, Hogwarts Legacy, The Callisto Protocol, and Return to Monkey Island. That usually means we’ll get new trailers for each game, whether they be gameplay, story, or both. Of course, other titles will be shown as well including Dying Light 2’s Bloody Ties DLC and Telltale Games' The Expanse. 
Next Tuesday, @geoffkeighley hosts @gamescom Opening Night Live from Germany.

Hogwarts Legacy was recently delayed to February, and this will be our first look at it since its gameplay reveal in March. Sonic Frontiers and The Callisto Protocol both graced Game Informer’s cover the last couple of months, and this may be one of the last big marketing pushes before they arrive later this year. Return to Monkey Island, also slated to launch this year, may get a firm release date as well.  
Gamescom Opening Night Live will be streamed on August 23. The two-hour event begins at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn't involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE's story would come later, in the 2014 Director's Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games' puzzler a bit more, well, shape.
Even with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director's Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I'm telling you: please don't write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2: Stay Human was released earlier this year and since then, the team has continued to pump new content into the expansive parkour RPG. However, that content so far has been related to cosmetics, in-game parkour races, or other gameplay mechanics. Techland has yet to release anything new that pushes the story of Dying Light 2 forward. 
That could change soon as Dying Light 2's first story DLC, Bloody Ties, will get the full worldwide premiere treatment at Gamescom's Opening Night Live, which is hosted by Geoff Keighley and airs August 23. To tide fans over until then, the studio has released a teaser trailer that you can watch below: 


"What dangers await?" a press release reads. "How can you beat them? What will you get in return? One thing is certain...it will be brutal." 
As you can see, the DLC seems to hint at a brutal faction within the City, perhaps one interested in gladiator-style arena combat. Only time will tell what Bloody Ties entails, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. 
For more, read Game Informer's Dying Light 2 review and then read our interview about the future of Dying Light 2.

PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 players know that, as the game was PlayStation exclusive at launch. It hit PC in 2020, but you had to buy it outright like any other PC game. Now, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass members might get the chance to try this Norman Reedus-led adventure across America with their subscription if a new, somewhat cryptic tweet from the official PC Game Pass account is anything to go by. 
Check it out for yourself below: 
sometimes we just like a good landscape picture #NewProfilePic
August 16, 2022
As you can see, PC Game Pass draws attention to the fact that it’s changed its profile pic to that of a familiar landscape. If you look at the profile pic, you’ll see what appears to be a landscape shot from Death Stranding. Now, it could be a different game but like, come on, that’s Death Stranding, right? 
All of this is to say that it seems like a formerly PlayStation-exclusive game – mind you, one developed by independent studio Kojima Productions that was funded by Sony Interactive Entertainment – is coming to PC Game Pass, a subscription service that’s a part of the Xbox ecosystem.

Oh sure, you're brave with your votes, but not one single commenter was brave enough to address the subject of honking their pud. Cowards. If you won't expand, we have to move on. This week, I pose a question of squeaky critters versus a squeaky coat. What's better: a level 1 rat, or Alone In The Dark's jacket inventory?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kilter Films, Bethesda Game Studios, and Amazon Studios announced in 2020 that a Fallout television series was on the way.
Not much has been revealed about it since then, other than a report from 2021 that detailed the show as a “gonzo, crazy, funny adventure.” However, images from the production’s set have begun to leak online, as reported by Eurogamer, and the show looks true and accurate to the famed video game series. 
Check them out for yourself in the tweets below:

The level of detail on this Amazon Fallout series 🔥 pic.twitter.com/fou1UL1vhs
August 17, 2022
As you can see, the vault looks pretty spot-on, as do other details like the Vault-Tec logo. Even the vault suits look amazing, although, as the person who snapped that image mentioned, they are a little different from what we’re used to in the games. Nonetheless, my excitement for this series has grown considerably since seeing these images. Hopefully, this same attention to detail has been put into the writing. 
There is no release date for this series.

"Sometimes we just like a good landscape picture," they said enigmatically. If you’re familiar with the Game Pass Twitter accounts, they like to do the flippant social media thing and tease followers. Well, this latest attempt has people speculating that the Sony-trademarked Death Stranding is about to hit PC Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evil West, the upcoming third-person wild west action game developed by Flying Wild Hog, has been delayed. 
Originally due out this September, the game has now been delayed to November 22, 2022. Fortunately for those excited about the rootin’ tootin’ action of slaying vampires and killing other various (terrifying) creatures, this delay only pushes the game back by about two months. As for why, publisher Focus Entertainment released a statement on Twitter explaining that it’s the result of the team wanting the game to be the best it can be at launch. 
Here’s the studio’s statement, in full:

Evil West first premiered at The Game Awards 2020, and it immediately caught my attention. It gave me big Darkwatch vibes, a game I loved on PlayStation 2, and the first gameplay we saw at The Game Awards 2021 last December confirmed those vibes. If you’re looking for more of the game, you’re in luck because, in June, the studio released more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. 
Are you excited about Evil West? Let me know in the comments below! Also, if you played Darkwatch, that game was dope, right?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. 
On Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.
ArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. 


“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”
Guild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.
Do you still play Guild Wars 2? Will you be picking it up on Steam to dive in for the first time? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.
The action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.

If it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.
The new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.]]></summary>

With Overwatch 2 set to release on Oct. 4, which is also when the game will replace the original Overwatch, now’s a great time to get all your cosmetics, loot boxes, and more in order. It’s also a great time to merge some accounts so that you can, for example, jump between playing on PC and PlayStation freely. Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. 
“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.
“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.”

At the time, details about content and features were still a mystery. However, a short gameplay trailer released today revealed several collectible items and a Dragon Ball-themed map. You can watch the zany footage below.


According to Gamespot, two bundles touting skins inspired by popular characters will be available for purchase. The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. 
The description of the event reads as follows:

I spin to avoid a hail of bullets, latch my skates onto a rail, and then flip through the air, my guns blazing as I perform a flashy trick to bring the crowd to its feet.

Backpack Hero is all about arranging weapons and items inside your massive sack to develop powerful synergies, see. Some items buff items touching them, while others benefit from empty spaces, or some insist upon being in a certain grid row, and some even move around by themselves. The buildcrafting gets fiendishly fun as your critter delves deeper into dungeons in search of a giant hunk of cheese.

That unlocks the door to some unique capabilities, from adjusting the sensitivity of the keyboard on the fly to using the WASD keys as a thumbstick replacement in racing games. It's also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

More specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature "incredible new content" from Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a "sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media." 
JUST ANNOUNCED: Watch the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE on Friday, September 9 – live from #D23Expo 2022! https://t.co/uZcDYdUZKA pic.twitter.com/RJ67ooTR2F
August 15, 2022
You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9. 
What Marvel heroes do you hope Hennig's game features? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

If you’re escaping a dystopian prison system where you can pay to upgrade to invisible handcuffs, your escape may as well have a jamming soundtrack. But you'll have to bring your own, because the world in Keylocker hates that stuff. Like in Footloose, music is an illegal activity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindhack, an upcoming visual novel adventure, opens in a jail cell, as a criminal named Unid is brought before you by a pair of armed security guards. Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

        <updated>2022-08-15T13:47:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima, is being developed into a feature film with John Wick director Chad Stehelski set to direct it. The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

There's enormous boss monsters, several types of void, an incongruous cat creature, Death maybe... Where it differs is that there are also a few glimpses of the Island Sanctuary, FFXIV's new solo farming content. 

Watch it below ahead of the newly announced release date: August 23rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

August 11, 2022
As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I grew up in a town where some people hated the colour green, because they supported Rangers FC and green was associated with their rivals, Celtic FC. They would smash green traffic lights, green street cabinets, green shop signs... 

I wonder what their reaction would be to Soccer Story, an "adventure RPG" about playing football-ish sports in a lush, green, almost Pokémon-like world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a year riddled with delays, Metal Slug Tactics is the latest game to slip into next year. Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot 'em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.
The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

A Reddit user claims to have leaked plot summaries for every single episode, noting that two account suspensions by Reddit add credibility to those leaks. Documents obtained by TorrentFreak suggest another incoming credibility boost - via HBO's lawyers in California.

        <updated>2022-08-11T17:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a "comedy open-world RPG" where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You'll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, "Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022." Check it out for yourself below:

August 11, 2022
As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let's be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Kirby's Dream Buffet that showcases many of the minigames we'll be partaking in when the game hits Switch. 
And speaking of Switch, today's overview trailer reveals that Kirby's Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That's exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby's Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby's different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby's Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too). For more information about Kirby's Dream Buffet, be sure to check out this story. After that, read this Kirby series retrospective that dives deep into the character's origins and more.

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventu…]]></summary>

Now, it's not a stunner as far as looks go, and it's not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it's far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it's been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld's usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I'm excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize.

By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

First published in Japan last year, Swery took to Twitter yesterday to announce its English translation by Dan Luffey is now available digitally. You might want to sit down for the synopsis, though.

This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken's offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a "Yup, that's me!" kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey's dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.
