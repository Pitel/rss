But according to a former Rockstar developer, the decision to go console-first mostly has to do with marketing.


According to former Rockstar developer Mike York (who's previously worked on GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 and discussed this in a YouTube video) the company always prioritizes "what sells."


"One of the main things I want to touch on is that the reason why a PC port comes later and not the first thing that comes out is because they want to prioritize what sells," he explained. "Most of the time, especially in the past, PlayStation was the big seller. So what the developer would do is they would focus all their energy on m…]]></summary>

That's dramatic, I know. But in all seriousness, the ESA has officially declared E3 done. After more than two decades, the show will cease to exist, following several canceled or online-only years, and a broken partnership with PAX organizer ReedPop. (Disclosure: I used to work under ReedPop, at the now-shuttered USgamer.)




Frankly, this was the death knell we all knew would toll. It's easy to point at the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the problem, and it was. But speaking as someone who attended E3 2019, the decline was already visible.

As is the case with Resident Evil Village, the VR mode is only available for the main story of RE4 Remake, but this time around you have trophies! I've thoroughly enjoyed my time playing RE 4 virtually so far, and while I've yet to complete the lengthy campaign, there are so many epic encounters I'm looking forward to tackling in VR.

According to the document, Atari owns a non-controlling stake of 53% of the company.


The year has seen quite a few acquisitions by Atari. While it started out by buying back catalogs of game properties, they later announced the acquisition of Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, two of the top developers focused on remasters, rereleases, and overall preservation of video games. In July, they announced their partnership with Playmaji along with a “minority investment,” and now we can see that came at the price tag of €4.6 million

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we near the end of 2023, many apps that we spend dozens, hundreds, and upwards of thousands of hours on give us our stats in a shareable graphic to share on social media. We got the music ones out of the way like Apple and Spotify, so now it’s time for us gamers to bother our mutuals. PlayStation and Xbox have just now released their year-in-review wrap-up stats apps.


Between now and January 12, 2024, people who have played on the PS4 or PS5 consoles will be given a breakdown of what they did in 2023 regarding all things gaming. It’ll start with what your first game of the year was, then your most played games, highlighting your favorite genre of the year, and so forth. 


Xbox players’ “Year in Review” will do basically the same, showing your overall playtime, showcasing your most played month, a piechart breakdown of genres from this year, and so forth. Graphics can be screenshotted for easy sharing on your preferred social media platforms. 




These stats will keep updating until the end of 2023, so things might change!


How to see your year in review for Xbox or PlayStation


For PlayStation players, head over to wrapup.playstation.com and sign in with your Sony account. This can be accessed via mobile device or PC. You can revisit this page as many times as you like between now and when the event is over. You also do not need an active PS Plus subscription or any sort of additional things to view this.


For Xbox players, head over to xbox.com/year-in-review to check your stats. The same applies here as with PlayStation. Simply enter your login credentials and get a thorough breakdown of all your gaming activity on this platform in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iam8bit has announced that they’re adding the soundtracks of Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden to their catalog of vinyl albums. They will be available for preorder on December 14 at 9am PST.


If you’re already deeply invested in owning the series’ soundtracks pressed in vinyl, your soul will feel incomplete without these two. Both the Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden albums appear to be supplemental single LP albums, containing only music unique to their versions of the game. The bulk of the tunes are already on the Persona 3 and Persona 4 vinyl releases, both of which weighed in on four discs.





With that in mind, if you’re looking for the most enduring songs from the two games, you’d probably be better off with the vanilla versions. Persona 4 Golden, for example, doesn’t include Heartbeat, Heartbreak, a song that has been playing on a loop inside my skull for about a decade.


Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like these two albums are going to fit in the Persona 25th Anniversary Slipcase. They will have to sit cold and alone beyond the embracing walls of the rest of the collection. On the positive, their covers are done by Drew Wise, a longtime contributor with Iam8bit and the artist who did all the 25th Anniversary covers. The Persona 3 Portable cover is even a mirror of the vanilla Persona 3 cover, but features the version’s exclusive female protagonist instead.


Both the Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden vinyl will be up for preorder on December 14, 2023 at 9am PST. Both albums will run you $31.99 American greenbacks.

        <updated>2023-12-12T20:26:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been eight years since developer MidBoss released 2064: Read Only Memories, but we're inching ever closer to a return to Neo-San Francisco. A new trailer arrived for Read Only Memories: Neurodiver with yet another updated release window, this time penciling the cyperpunk sequel in for sometime in the first half of 2024.


When Neurodiver was first announced in June 2019, it was planned for a 2020 launch on PC and Mac. More platforms were added as the release window slipped further. It was moved to Q1 2021, then Q1 2022, and finally Q3 2023 before the latest jump to spring 2024. That release is currently set for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. You can see some of the characters, story, and inspiration behind the series in the trailer below, complete with narration from creative director John "JJSignal" James. 




Neurodiver has ES88 attempting to track down a rogue psychic known as Golden Butterfly, who is hiding in the memories of others and slowly corrupting them. With an ever-changing form, Golden Butterfly's motivation is a mystery. It's up to you to use your own psychic abilities and your genetically-engineered Neurodiver creature to connect with the fragmented memories, repair them, and ultimately put a stop to Golden Butterfly.


These events are set about five years after the story that went down in 2064. As such, there are a handful of returning cast members you'll get to reunite with, like Lexi and Tomcat. MidBoss is once again attempting to deliver a loving sendup to the Japanese adventure games of yore, and that love is particularly potent in the FM synth-infused soundtrack. If you want to sample it all while waiting for launch, the "Pilot Memory" demo is currently available on Steam.

Looking to become an expert in potions, solutions, and herbs? Potion Craft: Alchemist Simulator may well be the game for you. And guess what? You can snap it up today on the Switch eShop for just £17.99 / $19.99 USD, and you can save 10% off the game's full price if you grab it before 19th December.
Publisher tinyBuild shadow-dropped the game on the eShop earlier today. This potion-making game was originally revealed to be coming to Switch during last year's festive House of Indies celebration and was due to arrive in Spring 2023, but that obviously didn't happen, and we haven't heard a peep since.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first limited-time event for Diablo 4, Midwinter Blight, has officially begun. The Midwinter Blight brings with it a period of perpetual darkness and bitter cold that will consume all of Fractured Peaks. As part of the event, players can take on new event quests, upgrade the new event hub, challenge a new event-specific boss, and earn event-specific rewards including a bunch of new cosmetic items.




A new character, Gileon the bard, seeks to reignite the holiday spirit of Kyovashad by enlisting the players help. The event-specific area, Midwinter Square, will allow players to build it up and upgrade it as they slay new Blightfiend enemies around the Fractured Peaks. Several new items can be used to progress the status of the Midwinter Square to unlock new rewards including a mount trophy, class-specific back trophies, weapon cosmetics, the Shard of the Dawn Offensive Legendary Aspect, Gileon's Brew, and more.


Players can eventually also take on an event-specific boss, the Red-Cloaked Horror.


It looks like the event is only available on Seasonal realms, so those who are playing on the Eternal Realm won't be able to partake without creating a Seasonal character. It seems like an odd choice to not allow characters on the Eternal Realm to join the festive event, but there's probably a reason for it.


The Midwinter Blight event in Diablo 4 is live now and lasts through January 2.

Ace Attorney fans have had a lot to love over the past few years. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy and the surprise localization of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles on Switch gave us a lot to celebrate. But, as far as the main series goes, there's long been a gap that's been waiting to be filled on Switch.
With the closure of the 3DS eShop last year, many Ace Attorney fans were concerned that the next three games in the series — Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies, and Spirit of Justice — would be lost to time, as the last two entries (including the 3DS port of Apollo Justice) were digital-only titles. But now fans don't have to worry, as early next year, Ace Attorney returns to the courthouse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision revealed via their Call of Duty blog that several multiplayer modes, including Zombies, will be free for Call of Duty MW3 this weekend. The free access event kicks off on December 14 and will last through December 18. Players will be able to jump in and have free access to six maps, four multiplayer modes, Modern Warfare Zombies, and three of the Ground War maps.

Those interested in checking out the multiplayer will have plenty to try out. Here are the maps and modes that are part of the free event:



6v6 Core Multiplayer Maps: Terminal, Rust, Highrise, Shipment, Afghan, Meat


Ground War Maps: Popov Power, Orlov Military Base, Levin Resort


Core Modes: Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, Kill Confirmed, Ground War, War


Playlists: Rustment 24/7 (Shipment and Rust), War Mode, 6v6 Moshpit (featuring Highrise, Meat, Afghan, Terminal), Ground War, Modern Warfare Zombies



Overall it's a nice mix of maps. Terminal, Rust, and Shipment are fan favorites, whereas the map Meat is a brand new map. Players will be able to level up very quickly via Rustment 24/7 which will allow them to check out some of the later-level unlocks to see if they like what is there.


It appears the full Modern Warfare Zombies mode will be included in the free access as well, which is worth checking out. Instead of traditional Zombies maps, MW3 features a DMZ/Warzone style open-world Zombies map.


The Call of Duty MW3 Free Access event begins on December 14 at 1 p.m. ET and will run through December 18 at 10 a.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mouse, an upcoming classic first-person shooter sporting a vintage rubber hose animation style, turned heads in May with its first look at gameplay. Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.
The noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.
Mouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer (courtesy of IGN) ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. 


Mouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It joins the growing ranks of confirmed 2025 titles such as Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Big Walk, Usual June, and Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.]]></summary>

Following Sony's lead, Microsoft has published its yearly retrospective as well, allowing Xbox and PlayStation fans alike to take a look back at the games they played this year. You can check out the Xbox Year In Review right here. For an idea of what to expect, here are some of my stats:
The original story continues below...
When the year comes to a close, many spend time reflecting on the past 12 months of their lives, the decisions they made, and the places they went. In recent years, companies like Spotify have capitalized on this tradition, turning it into their Wrapped celebration, which has users all over the world sharing their stats, blurring the lines between an internet trend and a viral marketing campaign. It's no surprise that other companies would want to jump on that bandwagon, and one of the main participants is Sony, with their annual PlayStation Wrap-Up. You can check out this year's version right here.
Those who participate will get a quick tour through their 2023 on PlayStation, including their total hours played, their top games, and even which controller they used most often. You can see some of my stats below – including how much time I spent revisiting Ezio's games for an Assassin's Creed retrospective earlier this year.
PlayStation has had a good 2023. Between Spider-Man 2's critical success, the generally well-received launch of Final Fantasy XVI as a console exclusive, and new DLC modes coming to The Last of Us: Part II and God of War: Ragnarök, it's finished the year strongly. This was follows their recent release of the PlayStation Portal – you can read out thoughts on the device here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, it's been about a hundredth of a femtosecond, let's see what people are trying to port Doom onto now. Oh my, would you look at that! It appears as though it's possible to get id Software's iconic FPS to "run" on cells.


In a meeting of technology and biology, PhD student Lauren "Ren" Ramlan at MIT (as shared by Reddit user AnNdPh) has figured out a way to use E. coli cells to sort of run Doom. Now, I'm not scientifically minded, so I don't fully understand how they do it.




In a nutshell: what they've been able to do is tweak or modify the cells to – for want of a better term – turn them into monitor pixels. This has then allowed them to display the game in a very rudimentary way.


I hope you have half a millennium to spare


While this means the E. coli cells are technically displaying the game rather than actually running it, it's still impressive to see Doom being ported in this way.


Ren also notes that the game is only able to run at one frame every 8.33 hours. Using this figure, they estimate it would take around 600 years to complete it in its entirety. Even the likes of Skyrim can't compete with that kind of longevity.


With the original Doom recently celebrating its 30th anniversary, the legacy of the iconic shooter continues unabated. One can't help wonder where the FPS genre would be without the 1993 release, but one's thing for sure, no one's running Call of Duty on E. coli cells.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yippee-Ki-Play.
Welcome to the party, pals. Publisher Wired Productions has announced that Tin Hearts, the adorable puzzler from developer Rogue Sun, has received free Christmas content dubbed 'Play Hard', transforming the game's tin soldier characters into “Tim” McClane, a 'reluctant vest-clad hero'.
Tim McClane, a blatant spin on Die Hard's main protagonist John McClane, will be fully controllable, making this content a significant departure from the main game that sees you manipulate the environment to guide the tin soldiers to safety, not entirely unlike Lemmings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sinister Statues is the name of a new mod for Elden Ring that uses a page from the Doctor Who playbook to make combat in the game more terrifying than ever. 


The mod essentially turns every enemy into a Weeping Angel by making them entirely immobile whenever they’re observed. From basic mobs to major bosses, everyone is frozen in place as long as you’re looking at them. Sounds like it would make the game a lot easier, right?


Well, to be fair, it probably does. In a video showing off the mod, its creator acknowledges that this hasn’t been designed for balance and is really just meant to provide a brand new way to experience the game. But that’s not to say a Sinister Statues playthrough is as easy as walking backward while locking eyes with an enemy. 




Don't blink


The mod also adds a new blinking mechanic to the game, which forces you to approach combat in a new way. Every so often your character will blink, turning the screen black and letting enemies swarm you. The lower your health, the longer a single blink takes. You can try to resist blinking by holding down the interact button, but that won’t last forever. Eventually your screen will go dark, and you’d better be far away from any enemies when that happens. 


The mod is designed to work alongside almost any other Elden Ring mod. If you want to play in first person, with randomized items, or with any other combination of add-ons, it should work. The only real restriction is that it doesn’t currently function with multiplayer mods. 


This is great news for anyone looking to spice up their next playthrough. We’re all still desperately waiting for more news of Shadow of the Erdtree, the upcoming Elden Ring DLC. FromSoftware hasn’t given us a release date yet, but the modding community keeps providing reasons to come back to Elden Ring in the meantime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Othercide from French developer Lightbulb Crew is one of my favourite recent tactics RPGs. It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning units just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.
But I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the story and setting are relentlessly unpleasant, a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to fuel new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.

Earlier in 2023, we saw ReedPop and the ESA end their partnership, further diminishing the prospects of E3's potential return. And with Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards meeting the industry's demand for content showcase between the two of them, that comeback was pretty much a lost cause.


Well, we're now bearing witness to the final blow.

While Nightdive Studios updated and rereleased the PC versions of the first two games, there wasn’t a PC version of Turok 3. They didn't have the source files, so they had to reverse-engineer the N64 version and port it over to their proprietary KEX Engine.


It’s a lot of work to go through, especially when Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion is hardly the best game in the series. To put it charitably, it’s mediocre. Neither liquid nor solid. Remastering it was hardly going to be a financial home run.


But, as I said in my review, “It wasn’t the smart thing to do. It was the right thing to do.” The remastered N64 trilogy of Turok games (excluding Rage Wars) would remain incomplete without that last game. For historical context, it …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know that House Flipper 2 once beat Lies of P as Steam Next Fest's most-played demo? Well, it did, and now, it's about to come out very shortly. Supposedly a comprehensive upgrade to the middle-of-the-road original, House Flipper 2 is about to prove its worth.


The developer, Frozen District, appears to be quite certain of House Flipper 2's quality on day one, December 14. Essentially a game about flipping old, downtrodden houses (in this economy?), House Flipper 2 offers an upgraded feature roster compared to its immediate predecessor. Its most interesting draw? The ability to build houses from the ground-up, if you so desire.

House Flipper 2 releases on December 14


Of course, the reviews for House Flipper 2 are pending still, and there's currently no telling whether Frozen District's new offering will outmatch what came before. Yet, the competition in this highly specific simulator niche is basically nil, so all prospective (virtual) house flippers will at least consider a bid on the $39.99 title.


The good news for those who are curious about House Flipper 2, but uncertain whether it's a good investment, is that Frozen District aims to host a 2-hour developer livestream. The stream will be going live at 4 PM CET, and it makes for a perfect opportunity to check the game out without any fuss.


Finally, the developer has also announced that House Flipper 2 players can expect a big Community Contest shortly after the game's release. "We're proud to let you know that in the following days, we will present a ruleset, a list of exclusive rewards, as well as a theme for the first official House Flipper 2 Community Contest, and it is going to be focused around building your own house project," wrote Frozen District. 


A promising start, perhaps, but it remains to be seen whether House Flipper 2 is truly up to the task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years ago, developers Fntastic debuted their "open world survival MMO" The Day Before with a fairly lengthy trailer (which has since been scrubbed from their official YouTube channel, but it's been preserved by IGN and Gamespot). It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.
Now, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would've rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.

"What started as a fun way to beef up the DUSK Steam Workshop," says the announcement from New Blood Interactive, "soon evolved into a full-blown visual remaster thanks to the hard work of a group of very talented developers at New Blood under the supervision of David Szymanski, myself (Dave), our QA Lead Cam, Dev Support Lead Scott, and the rest of the New Blood crew."

There's never been a better time to get into Ace Attorney. Developer-publisher Capcom has spent the last few years remastering and re-releasing every game in the series, and with the Apollo Justice trilogy, you can now play every mainline game on modern consoles. And even though the three games in this collection are unchanged story-wise, after going hands-on, we can comfortably say that they've never felt better.
The collection contains three games: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice – …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Destiny 2's Season of the Wish rages on, it's becoming increasingly more curious how agreeable Bungie is with its community following its recent troubles. The latest example of this being the case is the new Crucible PvP update, providing an alternative to the widely disliked Checkmate Control mode.


Following the introduction of an in-game LFG system and the adoption of a beloved bug-turned-quality-of-life improvement, Bungie is now making it clear that it's heard the PvP fans' critique of Checkmate Control. To that end, Destiny 2 update 7.3.0.3, which is coming out later today, on December 12, will allow players to choose between Checkmate Control and Control proper, depending on how they feel about the mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Day Before has gone down as a monumental disaster, unable to match the likes of DayZ. Speaking of DayZ, the Soviet-inspired, zombie apocalypse game continues to be a shining beacon in the genre, with the developer acknowledging its success.


In a recent post on Twitter/X, Bohemia Interactive posted a statement that looks back at the history of DayZ since its journey began in 2013. The statement talks about the "boundless efforts, resources, and man-hours" that have been poured into the game and how, ten years later, it remains "undefeated."




However, one thing that stands out is how similar the post is to the one Fntastic uploaded recently regarding The Day Before. Both statements have a similar vibe, but with DayZ's ending with the words "dead game" being crossed out, is this Bohemia throwing shade?


Kicking them when they're down


Some commenting have made it clear they think the DayZ post is "savage" and "brutal," suggesting that this may have been a deliberate dig at The Day Before. Most, however, seem to be getting a kick out of the joke aimed at a now-dead studio.


Regardless of intent, DayZ remains one of the best open-world post-apocalyptic survival games on the current market. It raises the question of whether we'll see an uptick now that Fntastic has closed its doors for good.


SteamDB shows that DayZ experienced an all-time player peak just last month. And with 51,459 people playing in the last 24 hours, we might see Bohemia Interactive's game pick up some of that Day Before slack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What a year it's been. We've seen a host of terrific games come out (and some not-so-terrific ones), with ups and downs across the board. But what's interesting is seeing which specific games people were searching for in 2023.




As noted by Geoff Keighley on social media, this year saw some pretty notable names cropping up on Google Trends summary of this year. In the top ten for this year, Hogwarts Legacy goes down as the most searched-for game on the site.


As praised as it was, some may be surprised it's at number one, especially as it wasn't nominated for any categories at this year's Game Awards.


Below that is The Last of Us. Again, this might seem like a bit of a surprise, but the recent HBO show – which won Best Adaptation – may have given it a bit of a signal boost.


The surprises keep coming


Speaking of Game Award winners, there's no sign of Alan Wake 2 on the Google list, despite the hype and subsequent accolades. Whether this is because the game only came out recently is something to perhaps consider.


I must admit, I'm surprised to see Atomic Heart at number nine. That game seemed to come and go with only a brief spot in the limelight. I haven't even heard of Connections and Suika Game, the latter of which has been out since 2021, but only made its way to the west this year.


It is worth bearing in mind that this does consist of search terms on a global scale, so seeing something unfamiliar is perhaps to be expected.


It's hard to know what to make of the list, though. This is, after all, what people have searched for on Google. Still, the fact that Spider-Man or Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom aren't on there is a bit of a chin scratcher. But bless, Starfield made it. Good for it, I guess.

After more than two decades, the long-running video game conference where developers, publishers, businesses, and press met to check out new games, watch reveals, and more, has been permanently canceled.

The 2020 event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but E3 returned for one last bout in 2021 with an all-digital event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has announced that their upcoming fight-’em-up, Tekken 8, will get a demo on December 14 on PS5. If you’re not the PS5 type, the Xbox and PC demos will arrive on December 21.


Excited about Tekken 8, but the January 26, 2024 launch date is too far away? Lace up your fighting… fists, you’ll be able to get an early taste soon. How much of a taste? That’s not really said. In fact, I gave you pretty much all the facts we have in the first paragraph. There’s a demo. It’s out soon.


Tekken 8 is the first new game in the series since Tekken 7 launched in arcades in 2015, followed by a home release in 2017. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it features an impressive cast of 32 characters, most of which are returning favorites, while a few are new characters (or a variation of one in Jack-8’s case.)


I’ve always played fighting games, but I’ve never really been a fighting gamer. I remember when Tekken was huge on the PS1. As a launch title, Tekken Tag Tournament was elevated to near-mythical status for a while. I’ve played them, but never to any really deep extent. I was more stuck on Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. These days, I’m mainly holding onto hope that we’ll one day get a new Bloody Roar, but with the state that fighting games are in right now, it doesn’t seem too friendly to any series that isn’t already massively successful. If it ever was. Plus, it’s now owned by Konami, so that’s a problem.


Tekken 8 releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 26, 2024. The PS5 demo arrives on December 14, 2023, followed by PC and Xbox on December 21, 2023.

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. 
It was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too.

"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close," ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. "We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners." 
Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business "has blossomed in different ways," noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. "That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brush up your resume, as Playtonic friends and Canteen have announced that the absolutely normal job simulator, CorpoNation: The Sorting Project, will be released on February 22, 2024. Alongside this announcement is a new trailer.


CorpoNation is a job simulator not too far off from the seminal Papers, Please. However, instead of sorting paperwork at the border in a bleak dystopia, CorpoNation has you sorting genetic samples in a bleak Corporate dystopia. It's probably the same corporate dystopia that we’ll be living in about three years from now. Might as well start practicing!




CorpoNation differentiates itself from Papers, Please by also having you experience life outside of the workplace, which I assume is just a dorm for employees. There’s a virtual desktop with games you can play and instant messages you can read. It almost feels like actual human contact. However, there are still shades of its inspiration through narrative concepts like an underground resistance trying to recruit you to undermine your employer.


I’m kind of looking forward to CorpoNation, but at times it feels too real. Hopefully, it’s more than a depressingly exaggerated extrapolation of “drive this car to work, work to pay for the car.” I’m hoping that there’s some fun in undermining your employer instead of the constant, clawing stress and anxiety that came with Papers, Please. I’m not sure my mind can take that sort of trauma again.


CorpoNation is coming out on PC on February 22, 2024. There’s a demo available for it now if you’re interested in taking it for a test drive.

Following the events of Tekken 7, the stage for Tekken 8’s story is set up to be perhaps the most over-the-top yet. In the six months since the defeat of Heihachi Mishima, his son, Kazuya Mishima, has installed a reign of terror over the planet using his devil powers. And while the setup is, quite frankly, a lot to take in, if the first four chapters I played are any indication, the level of spectacle and bombast reaches new levels in Tekken 8’s Story Mode.
The first chapter opens with Lars Alexandersson on a high-tech plane. He mentions the mission is to take down "evi…]]></summary>

The company, which is also behind the Transformers franchise (toys and other media),  announced this decision yesterday, on December 11. 
Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks called the need for layoffs in an email sent to staff a "lever we must pull to keep Hasbro healthy" and "a last resort." As noted by Dicebreaker, Cocks became CEO of Hasbro in February of last year and earns roughly $1.5 million in salary in the position – his total earnings for 2022 amounted to $9.4 million, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of course I was going to insert myself into the recent Tribes 3: Rivals alpha playtest – as a Tribes: Ascend player who’s mourned its demise for years, the reveal of a new, heavily Ascend-inspired ski-shooter was like seeing a long deceased pet rabbit miraculously come back to life. Cured, judging from Rivals’ more palatable monetisation plans, of the myxomatosis that killed it in the first place.


From what I played, Tribes 3 can definitely bring back happy memories of zipping around, nicking flags and copping Spinfuser blasts, and the finished article may well have the chops to create some new ones. At the same time, the playtest build was conspicuously short on much of what makes Tribes really feel like Tribes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Times are tough all around, but the video game industry has been hit pretty hard this year. Anyone who's been keeping an eye on the news will have seen the amount of layoffs and closures that have happened. Numbers estimate that around 9,000 jobs have been lost in 2023.


That's according to Game Industry Layoffs (as spotted by VGC), a website that's been tracking the figures since January. The most recent entry as of the time of publication is for December 8, revealing that indie developer Triple Topping Games lost around 10 employees.


Image via Game Industry Layoffs.


Unity saw the most losses, with three entries on the list totaling 1,165 job losses; a significant chunk of the ~9,000 being shown. Looking at the list really hammers home just how bad things have been this year, with some notable names cropping up multiple times.


[Shakes fist at Embracer Group]


The website will no doubt be updating its information soon, given that The Day Before studio has just announced it's closing for good. Given the unanimous negative feedback of its long-awaited post-apocalyptic game, some may not be too sorry to see the developer go.


However, for the most part, it's been sad to see so many people in the video game industry lose their jobs. Very recently, it was confirmed that Embracer was closing down TimeSplitters studio Free Radical Design. As a result, fans are left certain that the dormant FPS series will no longer be getting a revival.


With AAA and independent companies seeing losses in 2023, it feels like an uncertain time to be a developer. The fact that layoffs have affected the likes of Twitch shows that even those not directly involved in video game production aren't safe.

Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Free Lives have announced that the environmental strategy game-meets-city builder Terra Nil will be laying down roots on Switch on 18th December.
Described as a "chill, meditative twist on the city-builder genre," Terra Nil will see you tasked with transforming a series of procedurally-generated wastelands into thriving ecological biomes. How you go about doing that is up to you, but you'll be putting your green fingers to the test as you plant trees, create rivers and purify soil before leaving without a trace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terra Nil, the "reverse city builder" from developer Free Lives and publisher Devolver Digital, is coming to Switch next week. More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. 
While many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. 


As you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one. 
If you're unsure whether or not the game is for you, read Game Informer's Terra Nil review to learn what we thought about it. Listen to us talk more about it on this episode of The Game Informer Show after that. 
Are you going to check out Terra Nil on Switch next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ma(rio) baker.
It’s been rough out there for Paper Mario fans. Over the past several entries Nintendo has tested new ideas that haven’t come together anywhere near as well as the original games did, and there's good reason for the joy surrounding the return of Thousand-Year Door in 2024. Some indie developers, however, have tried to recapture the magic of the original releases with titles such as Citizens of Space and Bug Fables. Many have even succeeded in recreating Paper Mario's look and feel while adding some cool new ideas, and now Wildarts Studio has served up its own take. Born of Bread is a cute and summery RPG following the adventures of a sentient bread boy. It has its issues, which we'll get into, but overall this is an enjoyable little RPG that we’d suggest you investigate.
Born of Bread’s story begins with a group of researchers messing around in some ancient ruins and accidentally resurrecting a group of evil beings from a long-forgotten empire, and they’re hellbent on collecting the magical Sunstones scattered across the land so they can bring back their master. Luckily, on the same night that this happens, the royal baker for the queen accidentally creates Loaf, a magical doughboy with a heart of gold and the potential to be a great hero. After the queen’s castle is assaulted by these newcomers and Loaf’s ‘father’ is unfairly implicated in the resurrection, Loaf sets out on a grand quest to clear the baker’s name, learn more about the mysterious villains blighting the land, and hopefully find the remaining Sunstones before they fall into the wrong hands.

Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth's orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let's face it. Doomguy wouldn't be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He'd be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he'd be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. 
So Doom's hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they're having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn't know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000. Here's every classic Doom enemy ranked on a scale of the most miserable wallflowers to the life and (undead) soul of the party.

If you are similarly lacking in Stellaris knowledge, please rejoice in the fact that Nexus is a stripped-down, sped-up, turn-based version of the legendary space sim, which emphasises snappy tactical and strategic relationships over backstory.

Although the 3DS eShop has technically closed, third-party and indie developers are still showing their support for Nintendo's past-generation portable system. One, in particular, is developer William Kage, who announced a free DLC expansion for Fragrant Story earlier this year.
Now in an update, this DLC expansion 'Papaya's Path' has today been made available - offering up "about 6-10 hours" of extra gameplay (depending on your skill level) and "20-30 hours" to 100% the whole thing. It also bumps the game up to Version 1.2.

Only this time, it’s on motorized bikes. Then you see it, and you realize Cool Riders is one of the least cool games to exist.


Let me back up a sec here. Cool Riders is absolutely one of the best retro games I’ve been introduced to this year. It’s a year where I feel something finally snapped in my head, and I’ve come to legitimately enjoy a lot of kusoge. But the thing about Cool Riders is that it certainly looks like kusoge, but it doesn’t play like it. 


It’s sort of a Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game situation. While the game’s graphics give you that whiff of kusoge, the mere fact that it’s built on the bones of a better game means that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking for a more constructive way to deal with a ruined wasteland, Terra Nil now has a date for Nintendo Switch. Devolver Digital is bringing the eco-strategy game from developer Free Lives (BroForce) to Nintendo's platform on December 18.


Terra Nil previously made the rounds on PC, iOS, and Android (via Netflix) back in March. Devolver Digital shared a quick trailer to go along with the Switch news.




In Terra Nil, players are tasked with doing the opposite of what your average city- or world-builder requires. Rather than constant growth and expansion, you have to take a ruined world, breathe life back into it, and make like a tree and leave. This results in a short and sweet experience that brings something new to the table with a side of some much-needed optimism. 


During your time with Terra Nil you'll encounter a few different biomes, each of which is procedurally generated. You'll assist with ruined cities, volcanic glaciers, and more, including alternate levels that act as unlockables. There's something innately serene about helping the world start over again, and it's fitting that you'll ultimately leave it all to thrive on its own as if you were never there in the first place. 


At the time of this writing, the reverse city builder is just due out digitally via the Nintendo eShop. If you're looking to take some time to wind down and bring a lifeless world back from the brink, this is the best way to reclaim the wasteland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To this day, I love getting together with my buddies and having a jam session in Rock Band 4. So when Epic Games announced Fortnite Festival, I was hyped. But upon finding out there wasn't support for our plastic guitars and drums, not so much.


Luckily, Epic Games knows that there are plenty of would-be rockers out there just waiting to jam out in a new way. And the publisher confirmed that for the dozens of us, implementing peripheral support is a "priority."




Within a Q&A style posting on the Fortnite website, the development team addressed several topics. When asked "Does Fortnite Festival support instrument controllers?" the development confirmed that compatibility isn't available at launch. However, the team stated "it's a priority for the team and currently under development. We'll have more to share in 2024."


Epic Games purchased Harmonix (the developers of the Rock Band series and several of the original Guitar Hero games) in November 2021. Fortnite Festival appears to be the lovechild of that marriage.


Harmonix was still an independent studio when they released Rock Band 4 in 2015. At the time, they partnered with Mad Catz to manufacture a fresh set of instruments for the series' fourth installment. But production on those instruments ceased years ago, and now they're very hard to find in the wild or extremely expensive to purchase used online.


Now that Harmonix is backed by a financial juggernaut like Epic Games, the big question is whether the publisher will manufacture a new set of peripherals to sell to fans. Otherwise, anyone who wants to purchase a second-hand guitar, drum set, or keyboard is likely to have to spend a pretty penny.

Fntastic took to Twitter to formally declare what some folks may have already seen coming. The studio behind The Day Before writes that the game "has failed financially," and that it "lacks the funds" to keep the rapidly sinking ship afloat. Fntastic claims in the note that it will use the income received from game sales to pay off debts to its partners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC back in February – you can read Game Informer's Hogwarts Legacy review here. Now, as 2023 comes to a close, Google has released the top 10 trending searches in games on Google over the year and in the top slot is Hogwarts Legacy.

While many were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and information about the game, there's no doubt some of the Google searching for this game stems from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it's based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it. Nonetheless, it was the subject of many top trending searches on Google. 
As for what that means, Google describes it like so: "This data shows the top trending searches in the U.S., which means the 'trending' inquiries are the searches that had such a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2023 as compared to 2022." 
With that in mind, here's the top 10 trending searches in the U.S. for games on Google in 2023: 
Hogwarts Legacy – Our Review
Connections (if you, like me, didn't know what this was, it's a New York Times word grouping puzzle game) 
Baldur's Gate 3 – Our Review
Starfield – Our Review
Diablo IV – Our Review
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Our Review
Atomic Heart – Our Review
Dead Island 2 – Our Review
Sons of the Forest
Mortal Kombat 1 – Our Review
And here are the top 10 trending searches in the world for games on Google in 2023: 
Hogwarts Legacy
The Last of Us
Connections
Battlegrounds Mobile India
Starfield
Baldur's Gate 3
スイカ ゲーム (a Japanese puzzle game known as Suika Game or Watermelon Game)
Diablo IV
Atomic Heart
Sons of the Forest

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the third installment in the indie action-adventure horror title Poppy Playtime is now set for 2024. Originally scheduled for this month, developer Mob Entertainment took to Twitter to announce the delay. According to the developers, Chapter 3 simply isn't ready yet and needs a few extra weeks to reach the quality they are striving for.




No one likes delays, especially when you're this close to the scheduled release date. However, a brief delay of weeks is certainly understandable, especially if the game just isn't ready yet! Besides, for a single-player experience-focused journey like Poppy Playtime Chapter 3, it's very important for it to be at the quality you are looking for right out of the gate.


To help tide us over until the new year, Mob Entertainment also dropped the first gameplay trailer for Chapter 3, titled Deep Sleep. It looks like the biggest and most intense version of Poppy Playtime yet, so I'm here for it when it's ready.




Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 will release in early 2024 on PC and mobile devices.

LEGO Fortnite — a new game that's available inside of Fortnite — has been dominating online conversation since it dropped last week on all consoles. But former senior designer at Epic Games, Cristina Ramos, says that one key piece of game design was rejected for being "too hardcore". (thanks, Nintenduo!)
Ramos, who is now with Blasphemous studio The Game Kitchen, shared her thoughts on Twitter regarding the new mode in Fortnite. But what mechanic could be too hardcore for the hugely popular battle royal? Well, according to Ramos, it's Z-targeting — the very thing that was pioneered by 1998's The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A feather in your cap.
Turok first appeared in 1954 in Dell Comics, an American publisher notable for World War II-themed fiction and Warner Brothers licenses. Back then, Turok, dubbed Son of Stone, was indeed a dinosaur hunter, using wit and muscle to overcome a clashing of the species. In 1992, Valiant Comics rebooted Turok with more of a sci-fi lean, which is where the original Nintendo 64 games drew inspiration for their characteristic blend of futuristic elements. For American publisher Acclaim, 1997’s Turok on the Nintendo 64 was a certified hit. Even with its terrible draw distance, concealed by a prominent fog effect that limited your vision to mere meters, it was undeniably well-made, highly atmospheric, and full of clever implementations.
Fast forward to the end of the Nintendo 64’s life and the mainline series came to a conclusion in 2000's Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. Nightdive Studios, now the go-to for classic FPS restorations, has finally closed the circle four years after its Turok 2 remaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Dlala Studios and publisher Walt Disney Games released Disney Illusion Island, a 2D Metroidvania-esque platformer, exclusively on Switch earlier this year. It was nominated for Best Family Game at The Game Awards 2023 – check out all the winners here – and now, Dlala has revealed it is launching new content this week. 
More specifically, the Keeper Up update will go live in Disney Illusion Island for free on Wednesday, December 13. It includes new time trial challenges, quality of life updates like an improved map, and more. 

"In this fast-paced new experience, players must try and beat the clock and show off their parkour prowess, thanks to a set of new challenges arranged by the 'Mavens of Monoth,' a group of 'old Monoth' enthusiasts who want to see if anyone knows how to navigate these lands better (and faster) than them," a press release reads. "Upon entering a course, a timer will tick away as players scramble to grab collectibles through remixed areas of the world, making their way to the finish line in the best time possible." 
Elsewhere in the Keeper Up update, Dlala studios says Disney Illusion Island will receive "a host of quality of life updates, including new accessibility features, new gallery unlocks, and an updated map." 
Disney Illusion Island is available exclusively on Switch, and the new Keeper Update goes live this week on December 13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first it was a rumor, then it was news, and now it’s a reality. The recently revived Free Radical appears to have closed down today, another loss in Embracer Group’s ongoing campaign of shutdowns and layoffs.


While the original iteration of Free Radical filed for bankruptcy in 2008, it was partially revived as Crytek UK and later Dambuster Studios. However, in 2021, Embracer Group rounded up much of the key staff from the pre-bankruptcy days – including Steve Ellis and David Doak – and re-established Free Radical to work on reviving the TimeSplitters series. Now, before we even see any fruits from their labor, they’ve been shut down again.


As of now, Free Radical’s former webpage shows a very particular 404 message. Rather than a simple “Page not found,” it instead displays “404 Company Not Found :-(.” Meanwhile, artists Mark Normington and Adam Kiraly have said farewell to the company on Twitter.




The sheer amount of layoffs this year has made it difficult to be enthusiastic about the industry. For me, the loss of Free Radical hits pretty hard. I can still remember the day a friend of mine introduced me to TimeSplitters 2 on GameCube. We marveled at the level of detail and ate up the cooperative campaign. Later, in college, my group of friends would gather around Timesplitters: Future Perfect to cook up the strangest game modes. One particular hit was turning on one-hit kills and setting all the weapons to bricks and bats.


Embracer Group chose to expand rapidly during the Coronavirus pandemic and is now quickly contracting as the industry and the market as a whole seem to be contracting in terms of investment. As a result, Embracer Group has cut more than 900 jobs, with more reportedly forthcoming. This is during a year that has been exhaustingly rife with job losses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden is a game of twos. It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.
A spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her "Ascend" to the afterlife.

Perhaps it's unsurprising then that a major German PC retailer recorded the 7800X3D as massively outselling any other processor on the market as of late. 
As of today, the best prices available in the UK and US are at Overclockers (£330) and Amazon ($358). Both retailers offer the CPU with a free copy of the truly stunning Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game.

We'll admit it, we are more than a little excited to see what SEGA is cooking up. During last week's Game Awards, the studio announced that it would be reimaging and expanding on a bunch of its fan-favourite franchises, with Jet Set Radio being but one of the series to receive the 'surge' treatment.
The amount that we actually know about the project is reasonably small at the moment, but one thing that has been confirmed is that the game's original creators are skating back around to be involved in the next one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you thought people were done playing or modding Half-Life, think again. With the game recently celebrating its 25th anniversary, Valve's FPS is enjoying a bit more time in the limelight. To ago along with that, the community is working on a way to challenge players.


Over on ModDB, user jonnymartini is in the midst of looking for volunteers. The project, which is in the early stages of development, will add a few changes to the original Half-Life. For example, there are plans to introduce a new story element. In this scenario, Gordon will miss the train that takes him to Black Mesa at the start.

This will change things up, but will also allow for some other areas to be re-explored, such as from the training section or the Decay expansion.


Give 'em hell, Gordon!


But that's not all. The mod will be introducing new challenge modes to really test Gordon Freeman's might and gumption. There are five that have been outlined:



Crowbar only


Glock only


1HP only


Realistic mode (which will add realistic injuries, weapon classes, and more)


Permadeath.



Whether there'll be more challenges added cannot be said at this stage, but as I say, it's still early days. Currently, there's no release date for the mod, so you'll need to keep an eye on the download page for updates.


Hailed as one of the greatest FPS releases in gaming history, Half-Life has stood the test of time. Its environmental story aspects, seamless level transitions, and mute yet intriguing protagonist made Valve's maiden title stand out at a time when the genre was still finding its feet.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues to pave a new path for the Zelda franchise, building on the gorgeous open-world formula that Nintendo introduced Link to in Breath of the Wild. But while these games have received critical acclaim, some fans desperately miss the "old-style" of Zelda — the more "linear" games.
Well, Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma is aware of that, and in an interview with IGN, he has a rather interesting response. Acknowledging that Tears of the Kingdom has taken the series in a different direction, Aonuma puts fans' desires partially down to nostalgia, but also on wanting "the thing that we don't currently have".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. 
At the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date.

There are many reasons to commemorate id Software's 1993 jaunt through the demon-infested corridors of Mars, from the fact that you can play it on every device known to man to its undying modding scene that even lets you pet Cacodemons. But I have a personal connection with Doom that's a bit special. It's the first game that made me so sick I wanted to puke.

I badly need Crawford's thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment's Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.
In this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you're an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture.

Some game releases we're pondering this week: squad-based RTS Stargate: Timekeepers (12th Dec), Settlers spiritual follow-up Pioneers of Pagonia (13th Dec, early access), anime chainsaw metroidvania Cookie Cutter (14th Dec), "pixel pulp" visual novel Bahnsen Knights (14th Dec), and multiversal metroidvania Trinity Fusion (15th Dec).

Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.
Yet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”

After a too-soon dabble in early access, I was already intrigued by its setting. You'll never guess.
It's a welcome change from dusty radiation or goddamn elves again, and the RPG structure feels flexible and fairly responsive to your actions even before you start picking sides and ideologies. It hasn't quite stolen my heart, but it may well steal some of my christmas.

I have, and this year, despite not having had to stay up until 5am covering it, I'm grumpy enough to point out that we don't actually have to be nice about the great, clomping shiny trainer of marketing in 2023, the year everyone was laid off.

The game is a co-op take on the popular horror series, with up to four players controlling test subjects fighting to survive in a dangerous test facility. Check out its latest trailer below (headphone users beware: it's got a lot of shrieking streamers). 


The 1.0 launch will include a new Toy Factory trial with new MK challenges. It will also feature new evidence documents, character customization, cell decorations, legendary outfits, an increased level cap, weekly programs, and other quality-of-life improvements. 
The game will be sold alone in a $39.99 Standard Edition and a $49.99 Deluxe Edition that includes the Regent Start Pack, giving players four legendary skins, exclusive cell items, posters, and player icons. 
The Outlast Trials launches on March 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27, but shortly before its release, developer Remedy Entertainment revealed that it would be getting a New Game Plus mode with an alternative narrative and nightmare difficulty, amongst other things. During The Game Awards 2023 last night, Remedy, which picked up three wins during the show, revealed that "The Final Draft" update, which includes the aforementioned New Game Plus mode, goes live next week. 
More specifically, The Final Draft hits Alan Wake 2 on Monday, December 11. It features a new ending to the story of Alan Wake that Remedy says will spark speculation and theory crafting among its most dedicated fans. Plus, there's new lore to find in the form of new videos and manuscript pages. 


"Players will retain all Weapons, Charms, and character upgrades earned during their first playthrough," a blog post about The Final Draft reads. "They should come in handy when you seek the ultimate challenge of trying out the new Nightmare Difficulty level. Brace yourselves for intensified enemies, strategic gameplay, and an adrenaline-pumping experience that will push your skills to the limit." 
You will find all of your unlocked weapons in the first available shoebox for the characters, so don't expect to immediately start the game with all of your weaponry. 
Remedy says The Final Draft update also includes numerous bug fixes and slight performance optimizations that will be further detailed in the complete update notes, which go live alongside the update on Monday. 
The Final Draft update for Alan Wake 2 goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Monday, December 11, on all platforms where you can play the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards 2023 was a massive night for games, with more than 30 announcements, premieres, and more. It ended with developer Larian Studios taking home the Game of the Year award for its critically acclaimed RPG, Baldur's Gate 3. Shortly after the win, Larian revealed that the game was now available on Xbox Series X/S, meaning it's finally playable on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
 

Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke tweeted, "I had one job and that was to announce this if we won an award – sorry all but happy it's out there," meaning this might have been meant to be an on-stage announcement. Nonetheless, everyone's happy Vincke and the team took the extra time to praise its team of developers and thank fans for the reception during the Game of the Year award acceptance speech instead. 
Xbox players, it’s party time.

Towards the end of every year, we all get to enjoy (or in our case, give up our evenings and ruin our fingers to the tune of) one of the gaming industry's biggest events. The Game Awards is not only an awards ceremony - it's a lavish smorgasbord of video game announcements, trailers, and news stretching into the early hours of the morning. At least for us Brits.
In case you don't have the time to sit through the entire multi-hour livestream, we've done the hard work and put together a list of every noteworthy trailer and announcement that was shown at this year's The Game Awards. You can get started reading; I'm just gonna... shut my eyes for a bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mecha Break is an new multiplayer co-op mech game by Seasun Games that premiered during The Game Awards tonight. Fans of games like Armored Core VI and Zone of the Enders may want to keep it on their radar. 
The game puts you in the cockpit of a variety of mech suits, which you can customize the look and weapons of, to take on other players across a variety of modes. The biggest battlefield is a 48-player battle royale. If you’d rather play alongside friends, a co-op option allows three-to-six players to team up to complete specialized missions. Other destinations include a 3v3 arena mode and a 6v6 battlefield mode. See the game in action below.


Mecha Break currently has no release window or announced platforms.]]></summary>

It's being published under the EA Originals label, and is inspired by the myths of African Bantu cultures. It's also something of a memorial project, shaped by Salim's own experiences of grief, though you might not get that impression from the trailer, which is a blaze of magical battles and aerial stunts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Dusk Falls, the narrative adventure game about two families linked together by a burglary gone wrong, hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in July of last year. More than a year later, developer Interior/Night is bringing the game to PlayStation, but you'll have to wait just a bit longer to play it.
That's because As Dusk Falls hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 7, 2024. Interior/Night announced this news during The Game Awards 2023 tonight. It will also launch on the Epic Games Store and GOG on PC the same day. The studio released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement, and you can check it out for yourself below:


This new PS5 version of As Dusk Falls includes new exclusive features like haptic feedback and touchpad controls. Plus, a new audio description accessibility feature will be available on all platforms in March.
"In this uncompromising crime drama of betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience, players explore the entangled lives of two families across decades, starting in 1998 with a robbery gone wrong in small-town Arizona," a press release reads. "The story can be replayed to discover the vastly different outcomes depending on the decisions taken. As Dusk Falls has an innovative multiplayer mode supporting up to 8 players locally, online, or as a combination of both, using controllers or the companion app for Android or iOS." 
As Dusk Falls won the Games For Impact award at last year's Game Awards. For more about the game, read Game Informer's As Dusk Falls review.

The update,  Rundown 8.0 Duality includes new expeditions, new awful beings to murder you, and new weapons to attempt to stop them. It looks awful in a lovely way. Maybe I'll finally pluck up the courage to give GTFO a proper go, especially as a free trial weekend is running on Steam and the game's discounted too. I'd have to be some sort of coward to ignore that. Some sort of coward who doesn't want to creep and fight through hordes of horrid meatmonsters.

That's not a diss on Rise (which was excellent). Just that it's being developed for PC and consoles first, rather than Switch. And it looks rad as heck. Come and watch the reveal trailer below.

They're called Echoes of the Fallen and Rising Tide, and the former is available to play right now.
Echoes of the Fallen adds new story chapters that takes place before the finale of Final Fantasy XVI. Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King. Oh, and Leviathan pops up too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.
Zau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.

The world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.
Salim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.
The trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.]]></summary>

"We started Embark to re-imagine how games are made and what they can become," creative director Gustav Tilleby writes in a press release.

It's an entirely new take on shooters."
Tilleby adds that it's been amazing and humbling to see the community's response to The Finals. The team says now that the game is live, it is laser-focused on ensuring a great experience for the community while delivering surprises along the way.

I’m not familiar with DNF, but going by The First Berserker’s trailer, it’s all about exceedingly grimdark blokes beating the paste out of each other. In this instalment, you play a once-proud general of the Pell Los Empire, who has been falsely accused of treason and sent into exile. He’s pretty miffed about this! Berserk, even.

In development for roughly five years so far, it's an exploration-driven fantasy experience with building mechanics, a range of curious mythological creatures, and a procedurally generated open world that is apparently Earth-like in both geography and scale. Hello have just screened a trailer at this year's Game Awards. Earlier this week, they invited me down to their Guildford offices for a quick, informal chat about the game, which I am going to characterise as Fable meets Microsoft Flight Simulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The First Descendant is a free-to-play looter shooter from Nexon. There have been beta sessions before now, but the game is getting a full, proper launch next Summer. The exact date is up in the air still, but according to a blog post from the developers, it will be announced as soon as they can pin it down. Check out the latest trailer below.


In The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants – a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets. Your goal is to defend the planet from invaders called Colossi using the game's third-person shooting and RPG mechanics. The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.
There's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Check it out for free when it launches simultaneously on all of those platforms in Summer 2024.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-08T03:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sharkmob, makers of the battle royale Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodhunt, have revealed a new open-world extraction shooter called Exoborne.
The game is a tactical shooter set in an apocalyptic Earth that is being torn asunder by extreme forces of nature, such as massive tornadoes and lightning storms. These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. 


Exoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). 
The gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.
Characters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.
Exborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten years ago, at Geoff Keighley's awards show (then known as the VGX Awards), the development team at Hello Games revealed No Man's Sky. The ambitious space-exploration title promised a universe of possibilities and has since become the poster child for bouncing back from a challenging launch period.
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first teaser trailer, Sean Murray and Hello Games returned to Geoff Keighley's stage, now called The Game Awards, to give a brief retrospective and tease what's next. After a rundown of the last 10 years of active development of No Man's Sky, including several free updates, improvements, and expansions, the trailer teases big plans for 2024, with something that appears to involve more intricate space stations within the game.
Check out the No Man's Sky 10-Year Anniversary Trailer for yourself below: 


No Man's Sky was released in 2016 to mixed reviews but received myriad updates and improvements in the years since, delivering something beyond what was even promised in the lead-up to launch. Today, it is widely praised by critics and fans and is put forward as the foremost model for how to improve a game after a rocky launch.]]></summary>

The city has been plagued with vampires, so it's up to you to put a stop to it. Though it will feature plenty of action, it's described as a "very Arkane game", so fans should potentially expect it to have several of the studio's signature immersive sim hallmarks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t Nod, the team behind Jusant and Life is Strange, has a new story-driven adventure game called Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.
The trailer begins rather innocently in 1995 with a group of four young high school friends –  Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat – partying together without a care in the world. The video then takes a darker turn with hints that something sinister, and perhaps otherworldly, flipping their lives on their heads. 27 years pass with no contact between the friends, but the secret they swore not to talk about again brings them back together. Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is the first title of Don't Nod's Montreal studio. 


The game is coming in late 2024 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver publisher Nexon and developer Neople have revealed The First Berserker: Khazan, a single-player action RPG that is the next entry in the long-running Dungeon & Fighter universe. The First Berserker: Khazan stands in stark contrast to the most recent entry in this universe, DNF Duel, a multiplayer fighting game released last year. 
Neople says the DNF series combines the fast-paced, higher-energy action of old-school brawlers with classic RPG elements, all wrapped in an anime-esque art style. However, with The First Berserker: Khazan, players can expect hack 'n' slash combat and plenty of customization. 
Check it out for yourself in The First Berserker: Khazan reveal trailer below: 


"The Pell Los Empire has been saved – at a cost," a press release reads. "After the Great General Khazan and Archmage Ozma defeat the Berserk Dragon Hismar and the Dragon Legion, players will step into the shoes of Khazan as he is falsely accused of treason and exiled beyond the empire."
Neople says in The First Berserker: Khazan, combat takes center stage in Khazan's quest for vengeance against those who orchestrated his downfall, "marked by intense, aggressive, and ever-changing styles of battle." 
To survive, players must master combat, upgrade character skills, and combine weapons and armor (each with unique perks). The more missions cleared, the tougher the bosses, but defeating them and finishing missions earns players powerful gear and abilities. 
The First Berserker: Khazan will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been in development for a long time; by the time it comes out next year, it will have been nine years since Rocksteady's last game. But after years of secret development and repeated delays, it's finally around the corner, and The Game Awards just gave us our latest look. See for yourself in the trailer below:


The notion of killing the Justice League, some of the most powerful people in the DC universe, has always felt like an impossible task for the Suicide Squad, and the more we see of these corrupted superheroes, the harder it looks. This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).
Luckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.
But the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.]]></summary>

Players explore the open world of Isla Nublar, which teems with a variety of newly escaped dinosaurs in a fully reactive world. Stealth seems to be more emphasized than combat, as players must use their intelligence, skills, and wit to outsmart and avoid John Hammond's prehistoric creations.


Jurassic Park: Survival has no release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

"New Eden, 1695: Antea and Red are lovers and Banishers, trained spirit-hunters protecting people from lingering specters," a press release reads. "But when tragedy strikes and Antea herself becomes a ghost, will you honor your Banisher oath or sacrifice the living in a desperate bid to bring your beloved back?"

In typical Kojima fashion, the trailer doesn't illuminate much. We see several characters reading (and sometimes failing to do so) a tongue twister before Lillis' character screams in horror at what they see behind a door. 
Talking onstage, Kojima was joined by Peele to mostly compliment each other's work. However, Kojima stressed OD is, in fact, a game. But it's also a movie. And apparently something unlike much else. Or so he says. Peele said it was "crazy." I lost the plot after a while.
Anyways, check it out for yourself:




OD isn't the only project Kojima is working on. His studio, Kojima Productions, is also developing a sequel to Death Stranding.]]></summary>

Announced during tonight's Game Awards, No Rest For The Wicked is quite a different kettle of cursed fish compared to Moon's previous games, but I'm also quietly intrigued by it at the same time. For starters, this is an online ARPG that combines the top-down combat of games like Diablo 4 with the patient, weighty boss battles of your Elden Soulslikes. Come and watch its reveal trailer below to find out more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura stepped on the stage of The Game Awards to reveal the first game from her studio, Unseen, called Kemuri.
A stylish trailer showed off the slick art direction with various cool street folks doing some parkour-style running and jumping while brandishing weapons such as a katana. They also seem to be facing a slew of supernatural beings. Unfortunately, the cinematic doesn’t reveal much in terms of gameplay or details, but it's a cool first showing, if nothing else.

It will be released as an Early Access title on Steam sometime during the first quarter of 2024 before it later releases onto PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. 
No Rest for the Wicked features a hand-crafted world with a painterly art style. In it, players explore an island called Isola Sacra, spelunking through cavernous depths, lush forests, treacherous mountain passes, and more, according to publisher Private Division. Each location on Isola Sacra is home to protagonists "with their own problems," a press release reads, as well as hidden treasures, creatures, and secrets.

It seems like developer House House has some of that personality left in the tank, because their next game, Big Walk, looks incredibly intriguing. Check out the reveal trailer below,


In Big Walk, you and your friends will explore an open world full of puzzles and things to discover. According to the Steam page, you'll need to figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless. This explains why, in the trailer, we see lots of attempts at communication, from waving arms to holding up certain images.
The aforementioned Steam listing also says "Sit and watch the sunset, or steal your friend’s binoculars and kick them into the ocean." It seems that much like Goose Game, there will be plenty of time for shenanigans. You'll be able to check it out in 2025.]]></summary>

Terrific, demonic rhythm-basher THUMPER is getting a sequel of sorts called THRASHER, created by the first game's artist and composer Brian Gibson. It’s a weirdo racer in which you use gesture controls to evolve the creature you're controlling, in a “breakneck race for survival that begins at the dawn of time”. Which is certainly a concept. Will there be any flying hell triangles in this one? Will my thumbs be able to keep up, seven years after almost breaking them against the sneering face of THUMPER's world 3?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ninja Theory made another appearance at The Game Awards, this time with a new trailer for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. In the trailer, we get confirmation that it's still expected to hit Xbox Series X/S in 2024 alongside a new look at its extremely visceral combat. 
Like previous Hellblade II trailers, we see Senua trudging through some dangerous wilderness. She's not fighting giant monsters this time, though, as instead, she's up against more human-sized enemies. And this trailer gives us the most in-depth look at Hellblade II's combat yet – unsurprisingly, it looks great (and gruesomely realistic). 
Check it out for yourself in the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II gameplay trailer below: 


"The sequel to the award winning Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice sees Senua return in a brutal journey of survival through the myth and torment of Viking Iceland," the trailer's description reads. "Intent on saving those who have fallen victim to the horrors of tyranny, Senua faces a battle of overcoming darkness within and without."
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S sometime next year. 
For more, watch this Hellblade II gameplay footage from earlier this year, and then check out this behind-the-scenes look at the game's facial animation technology.

The expansion, called Valhalla, will be totally free. We see Kratos and Mimir traveling to an unknown where he battles the usual Norse creatures but also threats from his past, such as cyclops and undead Greek soldiers. PlayStation's official synopsis, posted below, describes the adventure as featuring some kind of roguelite element, but it is currently unclear what that means exactly. 


God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla arrives on December 12 for both the PS5 and PS4 versions of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced tonight during The Game Awards, Exodus is an upcoming sci-fi game about time dilation. Most notably, it features actor Matthew McConaughey, famous for his roles in True Detective and Dazed & Confused. And while he announced the game on-stage at the show, interestingly, the trailer didn't even feature McConaughey.
Judging by quick looks in the reveal, Exodus is a third-person action adventure. Its main narrative conceit revolves around an alien discovery and a couple experiencing time at different intervals. As the trailer's narrator says, "It was only days for me, but an entire lifetime passed for her."
Check out the reveal trailer below:

I like that this description is likely wholly earnest and accurate. This news came during the pre-show for Geoff Keighley's Shopping Hour and if a game like this is relegated to the pre-show, I can only assume the main event will include Half-Life 3, Elden Ring 2, and Deus Ex 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we give our live* reactions to the new trailer for ">Grand Theft Auto 6, a game that certainly exists! Basically none of the predictions we made two weeks ago came true, but hey, there might still be a bunch of gorillas in it. And what about the fact that it leaked, huh? Is that bad? Should we feel sad for Rockstar? Will it make a difference, really? And why did James drink so much whiskey this weekend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-quality microphones can be quite expensive - I recently reviewed SteelSeries' Alias mics which start at $180 - but you can still get a great mic for far less than you expect. 
Case in point: you can get the excellent Neat Bumblebee 2 USB mic for $17 at Woot right now, using the code TECHELF to knock off an extra $3 off the list price of $20. This mic originally retailed for $100 and attracted strong reviews at that price point - but at $17, it's cheap enough to recommend to literally anyone that uses a computer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find myself agreeing with Ed’s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora review so closely that we may as well have plugged our USB dreadlocks into the same magic tree. This is indeed an extremely Ubisoft game, with all the busywork and go-here-shoot-that roteness that entails, and although it throws some genuinely gorgeous visuals into the bargain, these also come at the cost of steep hardware requirements.
That said, good performance ain’t out of the question, at least not for modern CPUs and graphics cards. It will just take some digging through the graphics menus – digging that I’ve now completed, so join me as my blackened fingers bash out a convenient guide to Frontiers of Pandora’s PC performance and best settings.

In Black Rapture, the Big Bang never happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. 
RPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
