        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tick Tock Interactive has announced that their shortform anthology, Miniatures, is releasing on November 14th. It’s coming to Switch, PC, and Mobile (iOS).


Miniatures defines itself as an “arthouse experience” which is maybe why I’m having so much trouble explaining it. You can watch the release date trailer. It presents an unsettling but serene tone as things happen. Here, I’ll tell you what the press release says:


“Explore, interact, and watch the world shift. In this peculiar, artist-led experience, reconnect with the wonder, magic, and loneliness of childhood through four handcrafted, visually captivating stories based on the strange objects found in an old wooden box. Open the box and open your mind - who knows what curious things you’ll discover in there?”




Discover where? In the box or my mind? Because I’ve seen what’s in my mind, and it’s no vacation home. The box seems to contain puzzles. The game part of Miniatures has you “build unusual objects, inspect curious items, and untangle the threads of lost memories.”


While it’s not necessary, the press release also mentions that playing on a touchscreen (Switch, Steam Deck, iOS) adds “an additional tactile dimension.” Touch screen and I have never been on good terms, but have at it. The game itself looks interesting, though. I like loneliness, and my childhood was a safely mundane experience that, in retrospect, that’s way preferable to adulthood.


Miniatures launches on Switch, PC, and iOS November 14th.

Masahiro Sakurai is back with another video, and in this week's 'Grab Bag' episode, the legendary game creator delves into the world of CRT displays.
Now, if you've been around long enough to actually own and play games on a CRT (which, yes, you can still do now if you happen to find one out in the wild), then Sakurai's video will no doubt make you feel incredibly old. It certainly had that effect on us, at least. Nevertheless, it's an interesting look into the technology that shines a light on why many retro games prefer it over more modern LCD displays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's Marvel event continues for a little longer, with Iron Man entering the mix. In the game's world, he exists as both a premium shop outfit option and an NPC in-game that sells valuable items for gold. However, finding him is the hardest part until you learn his spawn location.


Where to find Iron Man in Fortnite


Iron Man as an NPC spawns at the ship landing site near Grim Gate. He'll usually walk around the landing spot or the nearby windmill. If a player defeats him, he'll appear as a blue hologram version of himself but still be available to talk to.

Upon talking to Iron Man, you'll find multiple items you can buy, including his Combat Kit Mythic for 600 gold. However, there's only one available in the entire match, so be careful that someone doesn't take it before you. Depending on what active quests you're tracking, you can also talk to Iron Man about himself, his equipment, or Doctor Doom.


How to get Iron Man's skin in Fortnite


If you want to play as Iron Man himself, you'll have to spend a bit of money. His skin is only available as a premium shop iron for 1,500 v-bucks or in the Iron Man Mk 45 bundle for 3,800 v-bucks. There's currently no way to get it for free, but at least it's an option if you're a fan of browsing Fortnite's in-game store.

Getting Iron Man's Mk 45 skin as a standalone item unlocks him as a playable outfit, allowing you to look exactly like him throughout your games. The bundle includes the following items:



Iron Man Mk 45


Mark 45 Energy Blades


Arc Reaction


Mark 45 Bass



All four items are also available as separate items if you don't necessarily want the skin but still want some of Iron Man's styles.

Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io.

My time at Evershine pushes the franchise into a new age with a story-driven campaign, brand-new art direction, and a wild frontier to tame. 


My Time at Evershine promises to redefine the life simulation genre. As you can see in the trailer below, it boasts a bold new art direction, but the changes go much deeper. In addition to the cozy life sim elements fans know and love from the series, there's a deep RPG system with quests and a major storyline in place. Pathea aims to broaden the game's appeal with these new elements, offering much more variety and multiple paths for players to pick when it comes to progression or an endgame.

Now, the interesting thing with this one is that it's actually not confirmed for the Switch. Instead, Pathea Games has stated that it is "committed to launching My Time At Evershine on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced". Oof, the upcoming 'Switch 2' then, or whatever you want to call it!

It's a fool's errand to try and predict Nintendo's plans but come with us as we don our red noses and white facepaint because we're about to do just that.
It's September, and that usually means there's a Direct in the works. Sure, Nintendo has been known to mix things up when it comes to showcases (just look at last month's back-to-back Indie World and Partner Direct), but a September appearance has been the safest of bets throughout the Switch lifecycle. In fact, as long as the Switch has been around, Nintendo has had something to show in September, as you can see in our Nintendo Direct broadcast history guide, and as Andy Robinson of VGC pointed out on Twitter yesterday.

According to EA studios group general manager and Respawn chief Vince Zampella, the new, currently untitled shooter will be one of those "back to basics" sequels that tries to rebottle the lightning of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 - these being the "peak" Battlefield games, in Zampella's view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We love them as partners".
Unlike Call of Duty, Nintendo fans have had zero exposure to EA's Battlefield franchise, with the series mostly focusing on large-scale, 'AAA' releases on Sony and Microsoft's console platforms alongside PC. There's nothing to firmly suggest that this will change anytime soon, but thanks too a recent IGN inteview with Respawn Entertainment's Vince Zampella, there may be some hope that the franchise could see a release on Nintendo's eventual Switch successor.
Now, it's important to make clear that Zampella does not comment on the 'Switch 2' specifically, noting that it "isn't announced and it doesn't exist". However, his praise for Nintendo certainly leaves the door open to some future partnerships when the new hardware finally sees the light of day.

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes (July 15 - July 22):




Alpha:

Unfortunately, he hasn't gone into any extra detail other than it was an "awesome visit" and noting how "grateful" the Limited Run team is to have such "great partners" at Nintendo of America.

And when you spend hours, sometimes even dozens or hundreds of them, staring at a protagonist, villain, or trusted companion, it never hurts for them to be easy on the eyes.


Sometimes, I find myself a bit head-over-heels for a few of them, reminiscing about the handsome men I've met on a few of my journeys. While I'm not sure I could fully commit to a relationship with a troubling few of these guys—regrettably, I can't fix him—I’d definitely take them out for a nice dinner date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The To the Max! Special research saga takes you on an epic adventure with colossal Dynamax Pokémon. They'll offer some of the best abilities in the game, but you'll need to improve them further with Max Moves. Find out how to unlock Max Moves in Pokémon Go. 


How do you unlock Max Moves in Pokémon Go?


In the third phase of To the Max!, you'll be tasked to "unlock a Max Move." Although you may be inclined to max out a Pokémon's stats entirely, it's actually a lot simpler than you think. All you need to do is change a compatible Pokémon into a Dynamax form and then exchange Candies and Max Particles to unlock the Max Move.


If you have yet to obtain a Dynamax Pokémon, complete the first phase of To the Max! to earn one as a reward. Once you've acquired the critter, go to the Pokémon's page and select 'Dynamax.' You'll uncover two choices in Max Moves: Spirit and Guard. Choose Spirit for better healing, or use Guard to reduce attack damage. An attack will also be available in the first section, which can be upgraded with more Candies and Max Particles.

To give you an idea of how much you'll be spending in Pokémon Go, the Wooloo Dynamax's Max Guard Move costs 400 Max Particles and 50 Wooloo Candy. Each time you've trained your Pokémon with a Max Move, you'll earn some XP along with it.


Use the Max Moves during Max Battles to successfully complete these challenging quests. Plus, you can claim a few rewards from the To the Max! Research, including Ultra Balls, Max Particles, and Stardust. However, keep in mind that Max Moves and the Dynamax form cannot be utilized during Trainer Battles. The moves also don't transfer when using the Pokémon Home app.

Strongest Monk Race in WoW: The War Within


For each faction, there is a superior race you should consider if you're looking to maximize your Monk's potential.

The best Alliance race most suited for the Monk is the Dwarf for a few reasons. First, the Might of the Mountain passive allows your critical strikes to hit 2% harder, which can be a noticeable increase for your Windwalker DPS.

Aw. The guy must have never visited nexusmods.com, which, even then, is pretty tame compared to what you can find if you dig deeper. Modders care little about your carefully tuned design, art style, or ESRB rating. They definitely don’t care about your sensibilities. Though, to be…]]></summary>

I mean, he would say that, since his job is managing that division and promoting its hardware. However, it has been a bit harder to justify or get excited by new consoles from Sony or Microsoft recently, often because those games can be found elsewhere. However, keeping this in mind, Nishino states (according to Eurogamer’s translation), “PCs are difficult to set up, but with PlayStation, once you turn it on, you can experience the content you bought straight away."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re working your way through Special Orders in Stardew Valley, then you’ll eventually run into one from the Wizard. He asks for something very specific, which doesn’t appear outside the quest — Ectoplasm. 


Ectoplasm doesn’t show up as a gatherable item at any point outside of the Wizard’s Special Order quest, 'A Curious Substance'. After picking up the quest at the board in Pelican Town, you’ll have seven days to collect some Ectoplasm, but where to get it?


Loations and enemies for Ectoplasm in Stardew Valley

As long as “ A Curious Substance” is active, Ectoplasm has a very small 9.5% chance to drop from the following monsters:



Ghosts

Found in the Mines between floors 51 and 79




Carbon Ghosts

Found in Skull Cavern on Mummy levels


Found between floors 31 and 39 of the Dangerous Mines




Putrid Ghosts

Found between floors 51 and 69 of the Dangerous Mines





The easiest way to get Ectoplasm for the quest is by taking the elevator down to floor 55 of the Mines and farming Ghosts on the floors before 79. Basic Ghosts have 96 HP, while Carbon and Putrid Ghosts have 190 and 500 HP, respectively. 


Drops from Ghost monsters in Stardew Valley


Each of these monsters also have a chance to drop other items, regardless of whether “A Curious Substance” is active or not:


Ghosts
Carbon Ghosts
Putrid Ghosts


Dwarf Scroll II 
Dwarf Scroll IV 
Ghostfish
Gold Ore
Refined Quartz
Solar Essence
Omni Geode
Refined Quartz
Omni Geode






If you’ve previously reached the final floor of the Mines, each of these monsters also has a chance to drop Diamonds and Prismatic Shards. Even if you don’t get Ectoplasm to drop immediately, this quest offers a good chance to stock up on other resources or source some artifacts.

For an open-world game like Satisfactory, it becomes even more important as the possibilities of building and expanding your factories are endless, and that can require a lot of resources.


Thanks to a generous set of system requirements from Coffee Stain Studios, you can easily achieve that balance even on a bit dated hardware. So, here are some of the best quality and performance settings for Satisfactory 1.0.


Best Quality settings for Satisfactory


To get the best out of Satisfactory, you simply have to set all the graphics settings to Ultra, as that will ensure achieving the highest quality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rift in Time DLC adds a whole lot of new recipes to Disney Dreamlight Valley, and many of them are incredibly rewarding in terms of both Star Coin earning potential and energy replenishment.


How to make Chicken Souvlaki in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Image by Destructoid


Chicken Souvlaki is a 4-star entrée and therefore requires four ingredients to make:



1 Poultry

Purchased from Gaston’s Stall in the Glittering Dunes for 500 Star Coins




1 Lemon

Foraged from trees in the Forest of Valor and Glade of Trust




1 Mint

A maximum of 10 Mint can be foraged at any time in the Frosted Heights




1 Paprika

Foraged from the ground in The Oasis and The Borderlands areas of the Glittering Dunes





Once you’ve gathered these four ingredients, make sure you’ve got some Coal in your inventory or storage somewhere, and then you can make Chicken Souvlaki at any Cooking Station by throwing the ingredients into the pot. 


How to use Chicken Souvlaki in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Screenshot by Destructoid


Chicken Souvlaki isn’t used in any quests, but it can come up as a favored gift for any villager, and sometimes appears as a request from villagers dining in Chez Remy. 


Where Chicken Souvlaki shines is in terms of profit and energy. Considering that you only need to purchase the Poultry, and everything else is foraged for free, you will make a minimum of 449 Star Coins. Goofy will purchase each serving for 949 Star Coins. 


Energy wise, Chicken Souvlaki will replenish at least 1,816 energy when consumed. This is nearly enough to fill the entire blue section of energy from empty, and eating two servings will provide ample yellow energy to glide around the Valley. 


If you want to use Chicken Souvlaki as a decoration, which is valid because it is a very pretty looking dish, you can drop it from your inventory and then move it around in the furniture menu.

Although it can be somewhat tedious, some items improve your chances through their unique abilities. So, to even the odds, here's how to get the Hardened Portal in Anime Defenders.


How do you get Portal Hardeners in Anime Defenders?


To get Portal Hardeners in Anime Defenders, complete Anthenyx Realm challenges and claim rewards from its Battle Pass. The Anthenyx Realm was first introduced in Update 5, bringing forth new enemy types to fight against. You must reach Level 30 to gain entry to this area, including access to the exclusive Battle Pass.


If you've survived multiple Anthenyx waves, check your Battle Pass for free Portal Hardeners. There's also a Premium version for those who don't mind spending Robux.


With the Portal Hardener, you'll gain a duplicate drop for your current portal with a 100 percent chance. That means you'll have one more shot at the challenge, even if you fail it the first time around. However, to use the Portal Hardener, you'll need to craft a Hardened Portal recipe. For example, you'll need three Portal Hardeners and one Golden Knight Portal (Legendary) to receive the duplicate.

There's a wide variety of portals you can utilize the Hardener with, such as the Solar, Demon, and Ancient Dragon. I suggest saving it for high-valued rare types, like Mythic and Legendary, since plowing through the Epic and Rare challenges will be much easier. You may even discover a Secret portal, unlocking some of the best units in Anime Defenders.


The higher rarities generally require three to five Portal Hardeners, so you'll need to be patient and persistent in your farming. Don't worry; it'll all be paid off once you acquire the more exclusive units and items.

Inspired by the upcoming Rush mode, EA Sports has given a sneak peek of what's to expect in the near future. The official pitch notes have shared vital information about the new season and what to expect for the rewards.

The latest DLC, which is due for release on November 26, is called Dine Out. Predictably, it’s themed around restaurants and their renovation, but it also comes with a lot of new features which will be very useful and fun to experiment with outside of the DLC content. 




If you’re tired of being a property developer, the Dine Out DLC offers you the opportunity to hang up your renovating hat and instead don a chef’s hat. With the addition of a new tool called a Universal Cooker and the added benefit of the new Cookbook, you can cook to your he…]]></summary>

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Jim's reliving Splatoon 3's epic climax...

I was a latecomer to the Splatoon series. If you had asked me three years ago what my favourite Turf War stage is, the 45 minutes I had spent with Splatoon 2 might have been able to cough up "the boat one" at a push, but that's only if I was really firing on all cylinders. The Inklings freaked me out, the motion controls made me dizzy, and it was all too fast for my little brain to handle. But then Splatoon 3 came along and stole my heart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

Crucially, it looks like legendary characters Richter Belmont and Alucard will be teaming up to take down Erzsebet Báthory in what seems to be a very loose take on Symphony of the Night. Alucard, of course, cropped up at the end of Season 1, so if you've not watched it yet, then get on it.

Hot on the heels of last week's Super Mario Bros. Wonder bundle in Australia, Nintendo has announced two new Switch bundles which include Mario Kart 8: Deluxe and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online Individual Membership.
Due out early this fall — so probably sometime next month — the bundles will include a digital download code for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the aforementioned 12 Months of NSO, and either an OLED or a regular Switch model. The Booster Course Pass DLC is not included. (We originally stated that the DLC was not confirmed, though the box states that it includes 'Full Game Download', not mentioning DLC. We've updated the wording here to reflect this)

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

Dreamy and slightly haunted, it's conjured words like "bewitching" and "spellbinding" in the comments sections, too. It makes sense, really. Tiny Glade's a game about making rustic dioramas and then photographing them. It's not hard to imagine some exiled magical person might live in here among the rocks and reeds and wild heather.

Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.
It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda51 told Gi.biz.

The announcement tweet was quick to clarify that just because this is the end, it doesn't mean it's the end. While we might not be seeing any more regular updates to the game, seasonal events like Splatoween, Frosty Fest, Spring Fest, and Summer Nights will still be popping up with some returning themes and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges are sticking around "for the time being" too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.

The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.

Next on the calendar is the Convegence games showcase on September 26th, which is a new event that - hey, what a twist - promises to feature exciting indie games. It does have some recognisable publishers onboard, including Secret Mode, Thunderful, and Kepler, among others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

Mere weeks from release after years of delays, plopped in front of me at a cramped, lightly vibrating Gamescom booth, and you still won’t reveal your secrets. I did get to play a brief whizz through GSC Game World’s eerie FPS – enough to feel encouraged, even – but be it time constraints or the darkness of my nighttime raid into the radioactive Zone, I would have liked to have quite literally seen more.
Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

Either way, Frontier are hoping to cater for all humankind's quirky day-out desires with Planet Coaster 2, by adding water slides and wave pools to the teacups and train rides of their management sim. I had a short go on it, and while there's no chance two hours of hands-on time could give me a full impression of the building game's suite of creative tools, I was quietly pleased with the jungle-themed pool I nestled into the earth.

The horror nous required to impart unease in the middle of the day are somewhat eased up on when you’ve got all that serotonin-begone drizzle to work with, sure. But this feels more poignant than that. There’s a soulful drearines and utterly heartbreaking inevitability to the vibe here, as your character and rubber suited activist pals try to get the bottom of a horrific incident. It’s got best British indie horror film of the year written all over it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming "survival experience" from the makers of Eve Online got its first trailer today, teasing spaceships against stellar backdrops. Eve Frontier was previously known as Project Awakening and is set in a faraway sector of the Eve universe. The developer calls it "a sandbox which focuses on self-reliance, skill-based tactical gameplay and third-party development". Huh? Third party development? Oh, I see. It has a bunch of blockchain cryptocurrency horseshit attached to it. Great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not enough Microsoft jobs have been splayed and flayed atop the Altar of Growth, so High Priest Spencer must once again perform the Rite of Strategic Repositioning. According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".

I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 


That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, Nightmare Operator, what are you doing? Nightmare Operator, no!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?
Ok, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.
You play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.

Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale "showdowns" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.

Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New & Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles".

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.
Devil's Hideout, a point and click horror game made by indie dev Cosmic Void, takes place in one such abandoned American city, and manages to deliver on this sense of dread even if its eerie hellscape is rough around the edges.

The submission details many of the usual targets, including torrent sites, streaming portals, and piracy apps. The main theme, however, concerns the role of third-party intermediaries. According to the MPA, these companies should take more responsibility, whether they like it or not.

I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing stupid listicles about Call Of Duty. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path. Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots.

That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black. This'll teach Johnny Hollywood to run his grubby hands all over our beloved Creepers, eh.

A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent. Fortunately, this week is looking quite bountiful.

It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

The site's operator says the site was shut down "due to DMCA" but, after weathering many storms over the years, maybe there's a little bit more to it than that.

It is hammier than a hamster eating a ham sandwich in Hamburg during a performance of Hamlet. It starts with "The Whispers [of the Eyeless] call to me!!!" and does not improve from there. Beyond that, colour me fairly enthused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit it, I downloaded the free prologue for horror game Baby Blues Nightmares mostly because I couldn't stop giggling at the offer to "utilize the unique abilities of a toddler", encompassing "stealth gameplay", "survival elements" and "upgradeable abilities". It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.

They've now published another blog post that torches the vagueness of the previous post with the righteously democratic flames of specificity. Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gearbox developers working on Risk Of Rain 2 have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

"It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

The suspect has been charged with copyright infringement. While posting small clips from movies or TV-shows typically doesn't result in criminal action, taking nude clips out of context is considered a breach of actors' and filmmakers' integrity.

It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

"Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2's third enemy faction is maybe definitely possibly probably almost certainly about to be released, as players report sightings of the mysterious menace on the game's Galactic War map. Development studio Arrowhead, aka the glorious government of Super Earth, are downplaying the rumours as usual. They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

The court upheld a lower court's decision, stating that IA's practice of scanning and lending copyrighted books without permission is not fair use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dobří herci, dobrá atmosféra, slušně řemeslně natočeno, občas dobrý vtip, ale scénář není nic moc a pokud o titulní postavě nic nevíte, je to místy dost zmatené (kdo je kdo, proč dělá to, co dělá, a proč by vás to mělo zajímat). Až na konci zjistíte, že je to jen polovina příběhu a na zbytek budete muset jít do kina za půl roku, což bych se odvážil označit za podraz na diváka. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
