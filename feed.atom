THQ Nordic and Pieces Interactive have locked in a date for their remake, or reimagining, of Alone in the Dark. The return to Derceto Manor will arrive on October 25, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
Announced during a spotlight on the game, Alone in the Dark will go for $59.99. And if you want to check it out before you put that cash down, there's also a free playable prologue going live tonight. It's up on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox.
THQ Nordic says that this prologue doesn't have spoilers for the main story, but will let you experience what this reimagining of an old classic has to offer.

Star power
Additionally, THQ Nordic has announced that Alone in the Dark will feature two recognizable likenesses for its leads. Pieces Interactive is working with David Harbour (Stranger Things) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) for their portrayals of Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood, respectively.
The actors are lending their voice, appearance, and acting to the protagonists. Each is a selectable character, and depending on who you play as, you'll get a different view of the Alone in the Dark story. And this marks another game crossover for Harbour, who's also set to star in the upcoming Gran Turismo movie. They aren't directly connected, but in my own head-canon, I like to think they are.
For those who like a little bit of scares around the Halloween season, October is starting to look stacked. Alongside Alone in the Dark, we also recently got an October release date for Alan Wake 2.
As for Alone in the Dark, this reboot of the Infogrames classic certainly has a long legacy to live up to. The team is calling it a love letter to the '90s classic, so we'll see if it captures the magic again in October.

Before Resident Evil and Silent Hill, 1992’s Alone in the Dark helped lay the foundation for 3D survival horror before the genre even had a name. Players explored a haunted building laden with elaborate puzzles and scary monsters, with gameplay emphasizing thoughtful management of scarce resources. It even featured two playable characters with separate scenarios, an idea later adopted by Resident Evil 2. Numerous sequels of varying quality followed, but it’s been many years since the series was culturally relevant.

Homeworld's newest venture is getting pushed out of this year. Gearbox Publishing and Blackbird Interactive have delayed Homeworld 3 out of 2023, and into February 2024.
Previously set for the "first half" of 2023, the team behind the new Homeworld is taking a little more time for development. Today's statement specifically cites time for polishing up  this new entry.
"Our primary goal is to deliver a Homeworld experience that lives up to the standards set by its predecessors and is worth of this series' incredible legacy," reads today's statement. "Homeworld 3 is shaping up to be exactly that, but in order to fully realize that vision we need more time to refine and polish the game."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope someone gets my references
Purveyor of good graphics, Videlectrix, has announced that Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is coming to PC via Steam and Itch.io.
For those of you who aren't cool enough to know, Dangeresque, the eponymous sometimes private eye, is a character played by Strong Bad, a prominent figure in the ‘00s-era web cartoon, Homestar Runner. Dangeresque: The Roomisode was a spin-off Flash game that combines this weird no-budget concept with LucasArts adventure games. It was called this because it consisted entirely of trying to get out of one room.
https://twitter.com/StrongBadActual/status/1661803493366136849?s=20
Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is a continuation of this concept… maybe? It will involve three roomisodes, otherwise known as a Triungulate. It will also include cutscenes and full voice acting.
Homestar Runner sort of fizzled out around the time the internet was becoming far less interesting. However, it never completely went away. New cartoons and other projects keep coming out sporadically from the creators, the Brothers Chapman. Notably, every so often, Strong Bad will play an old game in his Youtube series, Disk 4 of 12.
Homestar Runner was a huge part of my life for most of its heyday. It sucked me in as a teenager, and it helped inform the development of my sense of humor. I still subscribe to some of the Brothers Chapman’s approach to wordplay in my writing. I’m hoping that Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is a sign that we’re going to get a remake of Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People. I’m looking at you, Skunkape Games.
Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is coming to PC via Steam and Itch.io. No release date is given, nor if it will be of the money-cost variety.

Here, Clive meets Cidolfus Telamon, or Cid for short – because this is Final Fantasy, after all. Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. 
This hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI. While I’m not sure of its location in Valisthea, the continent where the game takes place, it looks built into a cavernous structure. It features a pub where you speak with locals about what’s going on in the world, side quests to pick up, and a music player, as well. I discover music tracks exploring Valisthea, and while these are new tracks from the score of FFXV…]]></summary>

Futurlab has announced that their masterpiece cleaning game, PowerWash Simulator is getting its next themed DLC, this time crossing over to the grimdark Warhammer 40000 universe.
After playing Warhammer 40000: Boltgun, I certainly feel like I need a high-pressure blast of water. That game is one of the bloodier first-person shooters out there. There are definitely some floors out there that need a good hose-down, which is to say nothing of the armor that probably stinks of rot and heresy.
https://youtu.be/EGNJ4l1Jgkg
Unfortunately, right now, we only have a teaser to go off of. I’m taking a guess here, but we’re probably not just going to be cleaning the logo off. Although, if we were, I’d appreciate the brazen approach to crossover advertising.
Is it Warhammer 40000’s birthday? No? I’ve just suddenly been getting hit by all these Warhammer 40000 press releases this morning in particular. Maybe it’s just because I reviewed Boltgun, and now I’m on a list somewhere. Or maybe it’s just like when you learn the word “expectorate,” and suddenly you start hearing it everywhere. The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon. Internalize that term, you’re about to notice it a lot more.
PowerWash Simulator is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Switch.

One after the other, developers' dreams of making the next big Destiny-like have gradually collapsed in on themselves. Like a deflated concertina, their last honks of life have been crushed down to desperate, fizzling squeals as servers lie empty and the cost of maintaining them spirals out of control. Some are still hanging in there, sure, but the genre as a whole feels like it's at a tipping point - and I couldn't help but sigh as five more multiplayer shooters joined the fray last night as part of Sony's PlayStation Showcase.

Through the last two weeks, players have been sharing wild contraptions in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. We've seen giant mechs, armored carriers, flaming robo-willies, and everything in-between. But as much as we like the elaborate constructions, we also love the practical builds that get us where we need to go. Like, for example. a three-piece hoverbike that's been quite popular in Tears of the Kingdom.
Finding the first person to build and spread something like this around can be difficult, as Tears of the Kingdom TikTok has multiple videos about builds like the hoverbike. I've seen this particular build crop up in a few places, across different social forums and media. But a particularly good explainer comes from 2uncle2dane (a.k.a. Uncle Dane) on YouTub…]]></summary>

It was back in Eiji Aonuma's 10-minute gameplay demonstration for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that we first got a glimpse at the possibilities of shield fusing. The series producer took a Puffshroom, stuck it to Link's shield, and faced a Construct head on, sending up a cloud of smoke around them both.
At the time, this was hardly a game-changing revelation. "Great," we thought, "we can make some weird-looking shields and take on foes with various mushroom abilities". Then the game came out and we discovered that shield fusing had the potential to be so much more than just some fungal fun.

This one wears its Skies of Arcadia inspirations proudly on its wing (still waiting for that Switch remake, by the way). You take on the role of Glenn Windwalker (fantastic name), the captain of a group of sky pirates who jets off on the adventure of a lifetime. There are various islands to explore both on the ground and in the sky as you go about recruiting your crew and catering to their individual strengths to achieve the best results in battle.

The beta will be available to anyone who's already pre-ordered the game, and it will run until the game's release. We still don't know when that final release date will be just yet, but if you're keen to see how 40K translates to a good old-fashioned classic RPG, at least you should have a fair old while to see what's up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After publishing the excellent Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters last year, Frontier Developments are now making their own Warhammer strategy game in the form of Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin. Developed internally at Frontier, it promises to be a modern take on the classic RTS, giving you four unique factions to play with, including the Stormcast Eternals and Orruk Kruleboyz, across a single player campaign and 1v1 and 2v2 competitive multiplayer modes. I got to see a little bit of an alpha build of Realms Of Ruin in action ahead of tonight's Skulls stream, and if you're a fan of tabletop miniatures, this is definitely an RTS you'll want to keep an eye on, as Frontier have gone all out on making this look as close to Age Of Sigmar's TT origins as they can. Here's what you need to know.

During last night's PlayStation Showcase, they showed a first trailer for The Final Shape, the upcoming expansion which will end the MMOFPS's decade-long main story arc, and a very good big triangle is involved. Oh, also fan-favourite character Cayde-6 is back, voiced again by Nathan Fillion. But you need to see this big triangle.

It seems almost unheard of in 2023, but after the announcement of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and a collection of classic Metal Gear Solid games for modern systems, Konami's Metal Gear franchise is all the rage once again.
Heck, it's even infiltrating the world of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, as one rather clever player has managed to create a near-perfect replica of Metal Gear Rex by sticking together a bunch of rocks, Zonai objects, and chests. It's really quite remarkable:

This week's Japanese charts are now in from Famitsu (via Gematsu), and it has been yet another stellar week for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — what a surprise!
Despite not having quite as many sales as it did on its debut, Link's latest still managed to shift a nonetheless impressive 247,689 copies this time around and once again lands in the top spot. As we saw last time, Breath of the Wild has similarly seen a boost in sales (people can't get enough of this Link fellow) and winds up in third place, fewer than 1,000 copies behind the unstoppable Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in second.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When discussing Final Fantasy XVI’s combat or watching gameplay, it’s hard not to think about other action combat games, such as Capcom’s Devil May Cry series. And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. 
While the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. 
“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, we had the Assist system where you could give orders to your partner in battle,” Suzuki says. “And by impl…]]></summary>

Pokemon has been having...issues lately. Amid the last-second delay of Pokemon Home, and problems with recent raid events, another bug popped up that dealt with private tournaments. Well, the latter just got fixed, at least! This info comes from the official Japanese Pokemon account, which tweeted out the update details this week:
"Updated data (Ver.1.3.1) for 'Pokemon Scarlet Violet' has been distributed. Fixed an issue where unintended behavior occurred in private official tournaments where specific users were invited. We have sent an email to all contestants who were affected."

When will the big bug and performance patch come for Scarlet & Violet
As you can glean from the super small patch notes, this is a minor update that brings the game out of the 1.3.0 era and into 1.3.1. We're still waiting for that big performance patch, but let's face it: it may never come, or it might not be sufficient enough to warrant its existence.
In the world of Pokemon, you never quite know what you're going to get with any given release. It's the curse of Game Freak (combined with short production schedules), and it's impacted them ever since bringing the series off of pure handhelds and into the console era of Pokemon.

There’s something that feels right about a monster-battling creature-collecting game coming to a Nintendo console. Originally released for PC on 26 April 2023, Cassette Beasts has made its way to the Nintendo Switch where it belongs. At first glance, Cassette Beasts clearly draws quite a lot of inspiration from Pokémon, yet assuming it’s a Pokéclone would be a mistake. While you explore an overworld teeming with cute and cool critters to battle and capture (or ‘record,’ in this case) and go up against an increasingly difficult array of opposing ‘trainers,' it’s a mishmash of mostly refreshing ideas outside of these basics.
After creating your little pixel avatar, you wake up on the beach of an island called New Wirral. Cassette Beasts’ story gets a little ridiculous right away: you find yourself marooned and separated from the real world, on an island filled with monsters that you can turn into if you record them on tapes and slot them into cassette players. At first, it seems like there’s no way home, but together with a young woman named Kayleigh, you learn that there might be a way out after all through defeating a bunch of otherworldly creatures called Archangels. These Archangels take on eldritch-like forms rather than cute ones, setting them apart from the rest of the monsters you collect.

Games taking place in apocalyptic wastelands is not a particularly new idea, but this latest effort from publisher Atari and developer Sneakybox certainly looks intriguing.
Launching "later this year" on Nintendo Switch, Days of Doom is a tactical RPG in which you'll be roaming a colourful yet deadly wasteland filled to the brim with zombies, raiders, zombie raiders, and mutant lizards. You take command of a group of survivors and must utilise their unique abilities to survive against ever-increasing odds.

Neva is a new puzzle platformer from the creators of Gris that tells the story of a red-capped swordswoman named Alba and her faithful wolf pup as they "embark on a perilous journey through a once beautiful world as it slowly decays around them."

You're able to slickly travel across the sandy terrain thanks to a rad-as-heck hoversword, a traversal tool that's described on the PlayStation blog as a "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Wicked, tricksy, false!".
Oh boy... We were worried when developer and publisher Daedalic Entertainment announced that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum would be arriving on the Switch after its release on other platforms. Now that it's out on PS5, Xbox, and PC, however, we're dreading what an eventual Switch version will look and play like.
Let's not mince our words here: it seems like The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a pretty awful game. Indeed, at the time of writing, it's currently sitting at a rather bad score of 38 for the PS5 version on Metacritic (which, according to VGC, makes it the lowest-rated PS5 game of 2023 so far). It's probably safe to assume that Daedalic is having a bit of trouble getting the game optimised properly for the Switch - hence the delay - so to say we're concerned about its overall quality would be a vast understatement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. 
Navigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.

Each of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.
And, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.
If you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.


Days of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.]]></summary>

The action centered around a local data center where 1,200 servers were pulled offline. Many of these servers were allegedly used to serve IPTV, but the action also took down several legitimate websites operated by entirely innocent companies.

After releasing on PC earlier this month, Cellar Door Games has now announced that Rogue Legacy 2's meaty 'Swan Song' update has now made its way over to Switch.
As the name suggests, this is the final content update that will be coming to the game and, we must admit, it's a pretty good one to go out on. There are a boatload of new additions that have come to the game as a part of this update including three new game modes, a collection of new fabled weapons, the addition of special 'Dreams' challenges, and much more.

The remake was originally supposed to come out four months after its reveal in 2021, tripped into 2022, and was then delayed indefinitely after switching developers. Essentially, this sounds like a Benjamin Button situation.

Logging onto Twitter this morning after last night's PlayStation Showcase, you might expect to see trending topics from the likes of Sony, Spider-Man and Alan Wake. But what did we notice before any of these? 'Splatoon' and 'Wii U'.
The former is in reference to Foamstars — Square Enix's new turf war shooter that looks more than a little like Nintendo's squid swimmer — but the latter has come as a result of the currently-titled 'Project Q', a handheld device that lets you stream games installed on your PS5 over WiFi. It's like a Switch... only it isn't.

In fact, I’ve had about as much fun with it as I would on a spa day in the Barad-dûr sulfur pits. Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.
In my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on. Graphics card allowing, obviously.

During PlayStation's (rather disappointing) Showcase last night, publisher Devolver Digital and developer Nomada Studio announced Neva, a new action platformer that shares many similarities with the developer's previous effort, GRIS.
The game is described as a "moving tale of a young woman and her lifelong bond with a magnificent wolf as they embark on a thrilling adventure through a dying world", and frankly, it looks absolutely stunning. That word is banded around quite a lot these days, and we're guilty of using it rather frequently too, but we really mean it here.

Square Enix unveiled its new team-based shooter Foamstars during the latest PlayStation broadcast and if you haven't already seen the announcement trailer, to cut to the chase - social media can't stop comparing it to Nintendo's popular ink-shooter series Splatoon.
As you can see in the video above, there are some obvious similarities - with Square Enix's new game also being a turf war, where you paint the map in your own team's colours. And instead of ink and squids, players cover maps in foam and ride around on surfboards. It's a safe bet Square Enix at least took some inspiration from the Splatoon series, and it's admittedly not the first developer to do this, either.

Sony hosted its 2023 PlayStation Showcase today, spotlighting what's to come for the platform in the future. Both first and third-party games were shown off, some set for the near future, and others still a ways off.
It was an interesting showcase, all things considered. The third-party developers were pretty varied and interesting; seeing labels like Finji up alongside the likes of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a treat, and there were a few surprises, like the next project from the Gris team.
Still, some of the heavy hitters were known quantities, like Street Fighter 6 or Final Fantasy XVI, or reveals that seem fairly far-off, like Bungie's revival of Marathon. Even though the Spidey gameplay reveal was admittedly rad, it was strange to not see a date at the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foam rules everything around me
Square Enix showed up twice for today's PlayStation Showcase. Once, for the anticipated RPG Final Fantasy XVI. And the other time, for the reveal of something a little different: a sudsy new shooter called Foamstars.
Foamstars is a new 4v4 shooter where players fight it out using foam. It looks bright and colorful, with some energetic vibes behind it all. Here's the trailer from today's PlayStation Showcase:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD_XuyEgfOY
As producer Kosuke Okatani explains on the PlayStation Blog, foam is used as both a projectile and a piece of terrain. Foam seems to stick in place, creating walls that can also be used for movement.
Splatoon comparisons seem easy enough to make. But where Splatoon paints the level, the foam of  Foamstars seems to build up and form new terrain all its own. The same kind of territory control-focused party shooter, but with a different angle on it.
Don't pop the bubble
Not many more details were shared today, other than Foamstars is currently planned for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. More information is expected sometime in the future, and no release date was confirmed today.
I'm curious to see what Square Enix will do, even if I tend to have a bit of skepticism and concern when it comes to any new game that looks like a live-service project these days. It's rough out there for a new shooter, but at least Foamstars looks a bit different compared to the more bullets-and-explosions blasters you might see elsewhere.
We'll see how the Foamstars rise or fall as Square Enix shares more info about the new game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation Showcase saw Square Enix unveil a squeaky-clean online shooter called Foamstars. 
This wacky new multiplayer shooter pits two teams of four against each other using weapons that shoot, you guessed it, foam. Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points. The trailer shows off a bunch of goofy weapons and the game pretty much feels like the anti-thesis of Splatoon. 


Square Enix promises to share more about Foamstars in the future, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5 and 4.]]></summary>

Revealed during today's PlayStation Showcase, Marathon is a completely new project for the team. It will pit players against each other as cybernetic mercenaries called Runners, battling for riches and fame.
The question of "how does this relate to the original Marathon" is valid, and a little vague. Over on the PlayStation Blog, game director Christopher Barrett expands on how this relates to the 1994 to 1996 Marathon series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2020 first-person action title Ghostrunner has garnered a strong community of fans thanks to its precise controls and high-octane action. Perhaps that's why, less than a year following its initial PC release, a sequel was announced. However, outside of some concept art, we haven't seen or heard much from developer One More Level or publisher 505 Games.
However, that changed today, as the studio released a first gameplay look for the highly anticipated sequel. Revealed during today's PlayStation Showcase, the trailer shows the game's cyber-ninja protagonist, Jack, participating in the series' trademark fast-paced, always-forward combat and traversal. According to the team, the sequel looks to elevate the formula in every category, including the addition of vehicular combat.
You can see the trailer for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hunt begins this fall
Peter and Miles seem like they're going to have their hands full saving the city. Sony and Insomniac premiered gameplay of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 today, showing off how the duo are working together to tackle the threat of Kraven, and other dangers lurking just below the surface.
Today's extended spotlight, shown during the PlayStation Showcase, confirms a lot about the Spidey sequel. While Kraven the Hunter looks to be the instigating antagonist of the story, we also see mentions of Prowler, Tombstone, the Lizard, and more. And, as previously confirmed, the Symbiote—though no Venom in this spotlight.
We also get to see both Spider-Men in action today, as Insomniac shows a scene where the player swaps from Peter to Miles. While Peter's packing some new Symbiote-driven powers that look absolutely brutal for combat, Miles has a bunch of new utility options. A wingsuit (dubbed Web Wings), a powerful web slingshot, and lines of web for stealth sections all look fantastic. It looks like both Spideys have the suit upgrades, as Peter also shows a wingsuit during a high-speed pursuit across the bay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrPZSq5YXqc
I'm really into the Spidey-swapping in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and surprised to see how well it works in the moment. Having both Miles and Peter take the spotlight works really well. It also amps up the tension, as Peter seems to be changing a bit thanks to the Symbiote's influence. Surely nothing bad will come of that, though.
A web to weave
This was a pretty lengthy gameplay reveal, though it didn't end with a date. On the PlayStation Blog, Insomniac's Aaron Jason Espinoza says they hope to share a release date soon. But right now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still broadly set for fall 2023.
Hopefully that window sticks. But Insomniac certainly seems like it's got a big Spidey adventure in store for whenever Marvel's Spider-Man 2 lands.

As part of the 2023 PlayStation Showcase, 505 Games and One More Level has shown off a first glimpse of Ghostrunner 2, which is targeting a 2023 release date.
The trailer shows off some futuristic Motorcycle driving and some speedy first-person combat. Not a whole lot else is really revealed, but really, what else do you need with Ghostrunner?
https://youtu.be/RL6tLbeMt2A
The PlayStation Blog reveals a bit more information about Ghostrunner 2 than that. It promises a bit of complexity with the motorcycle and larger, more open levels. There will be more versatility when it comes to arenas, and progression is being amped up as well.
Ghostrunner 2 is set to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got PlayStation Earbuds too!
Near the end of today's PlayStation Showcase, we got our first look at Sony's newest device. While it's not quite a Steam Deck competitor, it will give you a method to play your PlayStation 5 without getting out of bed.
Project Q is a handheld system dedicated to streaming games from your PlayStation 5. So far, we only have a general overview of the device. It features an 8-inch LCD Screen, and it supports streaming a 1080p image at 60 FPS. Additionally, it matches the feature set of a DualSense Controller, complete with haptic feedback. Considering it looks like a PS5 controller with a screen in the middle, that makes sense!
This device does come with the stipulation that it can only play non-VR games directly installed on the PS5, but none of that should come as a surprise. Funny enough, games streamed via a PlayStation Plus Premium membership won't receive support on Project Q.
[caption id="attachment_381641" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Sony[/caption]
With this announcement came the reveal of a new set of earbuds with the PlayStation branding. These fortunately work with more devices than your PlayStation 5. We have confirmation that the earbuds will support PC, and they can connect to smartphones via Bluetooth. The presentation promised that these will bring "lossless audio with low latency," so we'll have to see how each product performs after they make their respective debuts.
Neither device received as much as a release window, aside from the hint to "look out for more details soon." Given what we know so far, the success of Project Q and the earbuds will largely hinge on whether their prices match their performance. I'm always on the hunt for quality earbuds, so those have most of my attention at the moment. We'll have to wait and see if any intriguing new details come out in the near future.

Marathon was first released for the Apple Macintosh in 1994 and was a first-person shooter centering on a space-faring security cop fighting to stop an alien invasion. It was followed by two sequels, with the third entry arriving in 1996. This new Marathon sports a distinctly vibrant look and will also be a first-person shooter, but is a PvP extraction-style experience. Players control a runner in order to, according to the game's website, "compete for survival, riches, and renown in a world of evolving, persistent zones, where any run can lead to greatness."


The game's website also has the following synopsis:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest 2023 PlayStation Showcase announcements was a confirmation of the long-rumored remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. At the tail end of that announcement, however, was another exciting, admittedly smaller announcement that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be ported to PlayStation 5 in one presumed package.
The single image above appeared at the end of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake teaser with the words, "Sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5," with an autumn 2023 release window. The package is called Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, which implies more Metal Gears may be on the way. A Volume 2 could, hopefully, finally free Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots from its PlayStation 3 prison – the only platform that game has ever been made available on.
Update: According to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, the package will also include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Here is how the the listing of included games is worded on page.

Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake
Metal Gear Solid (Including VR Missions/Special Missions)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragons confirmed
We’ve finally got an extended look at Dragon’s Dogma 2 during the Playstation Showcase 2023. It's the first real glimpse we've seen of the game.
The trailer for Dragon's Dogma 2 actually gives us a look at a fair few of the enemies that will be faced, including the eponymous dragons. We’re given glimpses of the combat, and there are cryptic story snippets buried throughout, as well. Magic, bows, and swords are all confirmed, but they were also expected. The Playstation Blog doesn't really offer much more, either. The trailer description does list that it utilizes the "latest in graphics, artificial intelligence (AI) and physics technology to create a truly immersive fantasy world."
https://youtu.be/q_aDKIkGxog
Over time, Dragon’s Dogma has gained a rather dedicated fanbase, and the new title has been eagerly anticipated. However, how much longer we’ll have to wait has not been revealed. Actually, the trailer doesn’t reveal much, but it does at least give a taste of what’s coming.
Dragon's Dogma 2 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

The Resident Evil 4 remake is the remake that keeps on remaking. While it seems like yesterday that the Oculus Quest version of Resident Evil 4 made news, we'll soon see the remade version of this horror classic get the virtual reality treatment.

During the PlayStation Showcase, Capcom announced that "Resident Evil 4 VR Mode" is in development for PlayStation VR 2. We didn't see as much as a launch window in the trailer, though we did get to see the iconic village fight from a first person perspective. Fortunately, VR Mode will arrive as free DLC for Resident Evil 4 on PlayStation 5. As of writing, this feature will stay exclusive to Sony's latest Virtual Reality headset.
We'll have to wait and see if VR support substantially transforms the Resident Evil 4 experience. You can find the remake of Resident Evil 4 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Basim was introduced to Assassin’s Creed players in the earlier release of Valhalla, but this new game jumps back to an earlier time in the character’s life.


The action on display looks slick and modern but strongly calls to mind the flow of gameplay that longtime players may recall from early games in the series, controlling the likes of Altair and Ezio as they moved through large urban cityscapes. The new combat system, in particular, features some especially impressive animations and combat moves. The trailer also suggests that players will have a number of choices in how to approach a given mission, with clear decisions outlined in pre-mission briefings and then the chance to execute on a chosen plan.
Assassin’s Creed Mirage is targeting release on October 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC.]]></summary>

As part of the Playstation Showcase 2023, Sony has revealed that the Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater remake is actually real. It is confirmed to be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
They’ve also shown off a teaser trailer that doesn’t reveal a whole lot. It starts off with a bunch of animals fighting each other, and then Naked Snake reveals himself.
https://youtu.be/1YDauj2Ayog
Still, just the confirmation that this exists is a pretty big deal. The remake has been rumored for yonks now, and I’m sure many people will be excited by this news. I’m personally curious about what a post-Hideo Kojima Metal Gear Solid looks like, and Metal Gear Survive doesn’t count. Actually, this kind of doesn’t either, since it’s a remake.
The Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater remake will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rumors were true. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is getting remade for PlayStation 5 and Xbox. 
The remake is officially called Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. A cinematic teaser showcased a jungle filled with dangerous animals vying for dominance, with Naked Snake emerging from the depth of a bog to show off his remade look. Originally released in 2004, the title is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss and lays the groundwork for the entire Metal Gear fiction. 


Unfortunately, we don't get to see gameplay, and the title doesn’t have a release window, but the first three Metal Gear Solid games are also being bundled in a collection heading to PlayStation 5 this fall. What do you think of this first look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake
In a reveal stacking on top of a reveal, the news of Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater's return was punctuated with the announcement of Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1. This splash screen promised that we can "sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5" this autumn.
So far, we know that the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 will contain the following games:
Metal Gear Solid
Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
The second and third titles will be based off the HD Collection versions of each game. Otherwise, we await more details about any extra features this compilation may bring.
A new promotional website for Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 promises the compilation will "allow fans to play the games as they were, as first released on the latest platforms." However, we have yet to receive official word on which platforms this collection will appear on. We'll keep you posted as we learn more.
Konami has pumped out retro compilations of its glory day games at a consistent pace. In other words, it's reasonable to believe that Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 will follow a similar trend. Even more intriguing is the "Vol 1" part of the title, implying that a second collection will eventually appear. We'll have to see how these games look on modern hardware later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 had an appearance today during the PlayStation Showcase event. And as you might've guessed, the trailer left a lot of questions. But it did answer an all-important one: when the game is coming out. 


Here's what we gathered: Alan is trapped ... somewhere. According to him, he has to write to escape. Ostensibly, that's from the cult members chasing and attacking seemingly everyone within a 50-mile radius. Alan is writing about the police investigation into the death of Robert Nightingale, one of the antagonists of the first game. Here, the trailer splits into multiple perspectives: that of Alan and that of two investigators (one of which is voiced by James McCaffrey, of Max Payne fame, which Remedy also developed). Notably, we see that we'll play at least two different characters in Alan Wake 2: Alan, of course, but then also one of the investigators, a young woman named Saga Anderson. 
The trailer closes with the game's release date: October 17, 2023. 
Alan Wake 2 was originally announced back at The Game Awards 2021 via a cinematic trailer. This is the first time we've seen the game in action.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation Showcase brought the reveal of Sword of the Sea, a new game from Giant Squid, the development team behind Abzu and The Pathless.
The most striking visuals of the new game come from a vast desert that brings to mind thatgamecompany’s Journey. That’s not coincidence, since Giant Squid’s founder is Matt Nava, who was previously art director at thatgamecompany. But while this new game is destined to draw strong comparisons to that classic title, there were some notable differences on display. First, the desert itself looks much more like a flowing sea, and the character you control like a surfer moving through the water. In certain sequences, the desert seems to actually transform into water, suggesting a mystery at the core of the game.
In the footage shown, we see a focus on flow movement for the protagonist as they ride across the sand and trick off of half-pipes. From surrounding descriptions about the game, we know that you control a character named the Wraith, who was brought back to life to restore life to a ruined world, while facing off against vast leviathans that attempt to block progress.
Sword of the Sea is coming to PS5, but no word yet on a release date.]]></summary>

As part of the 2023 Playstation Showcase, we’ve been given an extensive look at Phantom Blade Zero. It is a "Spirtual Rebirth" of the Rainblood games, which were previously never released outside of China.
https://youtu.be/pueXBkFMK7Q
Built in Unreal Engine 5, Phantom Blade Zero follows a seemingly doomed protagonist. The game is set in a place called the "Phantom World," and said protagonist is an assassin named Soul. It’s described as an action-RPG and is a mix of Chinese Martial arts and Steampunk. The trailer demonstrates a number of facets of gameplay, including setpiece moments and combat.
The world is described as semi-open, with the S-Game Studio Founder saying, "Phantom Blade Zero unfolds in a semi-open world, consisting of multiple large maps filled with diverse, handcrafted activities." He also goes onto describe the style as "Bleak and punishing." That may sound like Dark Souls, but the combat depicted in the trailer looks nothing like that. The enemy design definitely has some things in common with Sekiro, at least.
No release date is stated, but it’s currently announced for PC and PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A brand new Journey
During today's PlayStation Showcase, we saw a glimpse of the newest game from Giant Squid, the creators of ABZÛ and The Pathless.
Sword of the Sea showed off a lot of sand surfing, immediately evoking memories of 2012's Journey from thatgamecompany. In fact, the trailer reminds us that this game comes from the "visionary artist" that brought us Journey. In other words, the developers aren't shy on this connection to the decade-old classic PlayStation 3 title.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUmt8SPfJk
In a supplemental post on the PlayStation Blog, Giant Squid founder Matt Nava provides a few key details about this upcoming title. As seen in the footage provided, Sword of the Sea controls movement via what it calls a hoversword. This cutely named device promises to control like "a snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one," according to Nava.
Controlling like Tony Hawk everywhere sounds intriguing, though it's the "sword" part of the "hoversword" that intrigues me. I'm not anticipating combat necessarily, but if there's a blade in a game, I assume we'll need to slice something.
The post also provides a few key story details to give context to the trailer. We control a character called Wraith, tasked with restoring life to submerged ruins known as the Necropolis of the Gods. We'll bring back "giant shoals of fish and creatures," though we'll also encounter leviathans that won't take kindly to our presence. We'll have to learn more about this world after the game launches.
Honestly, the promise of an "emotional core" and a plot about returning life to the world reminds me of Terranigma. In other words, I'm already all in for this one. No release window has been revealed so far, so we may need to wait until we can ride on hoverswords ourselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prepare for Hell Dive
Helldivers, it's time for another drop. Arrowhead Game Studios has announced that Helldivers 2 will drop onto new planets, with a new perspective, in 2023.
Revealed during today's PlayStation Showcase, Helldivers 2 still looks to feature much of the Starship Troopers-esque gunning and bug fighting. This time, though, the action is swapping to an over-the-shoulder shooter, rather than the original's top-down perspective.
[caption id="attachment_381595" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Arrowhead/PlayStation[/caption]
In a post on the PlayStation Blog, Arrowhead's Katherine Baskin confirms many of the same gameplay features will return: customizable loadouts, stratagems, and of course, friendly fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE7KTE28HrA
Co-op is also still a focus, as teams will have to strategize and complete objectives together. So even though it looks like the camera's headed in a new direction, the goal is still the same team-driven, bug-blasting action.
"Brace yourselves for adrenaline-fueled moments, intense action, and a bond that forms when you rely on your team to complete missions or comically fail due to the reckless handling of over-the-top firepower," said Arrowhead Game Studios CEO and game director Johan Pilestedt. "Most importantly, we hope that the laughter we share in the studio while playing the game will resonate with you as you enjoy this crazy universe."
While the change is perspective might be odd, I put a lot of hours into the original Helldivers. If they can maintain the same quality of co-op into this new approach, I could be talked into some more hell dives. Helldivers 2 is currently planned for PlayStation 5 and PC.

While it was hard to ascertain specifics from the trailer, we did get glimpses at the game's action RPG combat, which is fast, frenetic, and stylish. According to a YouTube description, Phantom Blade 0 is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you play as the Dark Raider, out for revenge against "The Order." Additionally, the voiceover twice asks a disembodied character what they will do with what little time they have left. Specifically, 66 days. Their response is to get their heart back.
Check out the trailer below:


No release information was given.
Phantom Blade 0 is being developed by Cruel Man Studio, based in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. The studio was founded in 2019, and thus far, has worked with Tencent and Square Enix.]]></summary>

But while these tend to be some of the funniest episodes each season, some segments are better than others. So we decided…

This afternoon will see Sony Computer Entertainment take to the airwaves for its May 2023 PlayStation Showcase stream. Kicking off in about 30 minutes from now, PlayStation fans can expect news and updates on a jackload of releases, currently in development for PS4, PS5, and/or PSVR 2 platforms.
While we don't quite know exactly what will be shown on this afternoon's stream, it seems very likely that Insomniac will have some new footage, (and probably a launch date), for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which is one of the few PlayStation exclusives still planned for 2023. It's likely that Square Enix will also drop in for some Final Fantasy XVI updates, ahead of the RPGs late-June launch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4EKydVVvHk
In regards to third-party titles, it's getting a little late for Street Fighter 6 updates, but perhaps we'll see another trailer or gameplay footage for NetherRealm Studios' recently announced Mortal Kombat 1. There are also some Hail Mary possibilities, such as Kojima Productions' Death Stranding 2, and an update on Marvel's Wolverine — But one would obviously expect Insomniac to focus on its current Marvel Comics game before it starts talking about the next one.
Whatever The Blue Brand has to show us, we hope that you'll grab a drink and settle in with us. Feel free to leap into the comments with your thoughts, reactions, and opinions to the news as it rolls out in front of us. Given another time-out from E3, these streams remain the best way for us to enjoy the summer of gaming (as opposed to The Summer of Gaming) together. So... let's tune in to the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase stream and see what releases will be forcing Suicide Squad to backpedal once again.

While I'm sure the majority of tonight's announcements won't have an immediate and direct impact on us over in PC town, it's well known that Sony have been stepping up their PC game recently, and so a lot of what you see here will probably make the jump eventually, even if it's several years down the line. So come and join us for an early glimpse of PC's possible future. I'll be liveblogging tonight's proceedings, which kick off at 9pm BST / 1pm PDT. See you there!

Ubisoft is surfacing with an update on the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake. The project is still ongoing, but sounds like it has been effectively taken back to the drawing board at Ubisoft Montreal.
In a new update, Ubisoft says the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is "very much alive" and in the "conception" phase of development. Ubisoft Montreal took over development on the project from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai last year.
Here's producer Jean-Francois Naud on the current status of the remake:
"In terms of the development stage, we're in conception right now. Since we took over the project, we've been looking at feedback from the community and finding our own way of delivering the game. Now, we're building up the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well then. Mere minutes after Nvidia hit the launch button on the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, AMD rocked up with a new 1080p graphics card of their own: the Radeon RX 7600. Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.
Based on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.

Well, this is one we're almost sure we haven't seen before. Indie developer Strange Scaffold has revealed that its 'narrative poker adventure' game Sunshine Shuffle has been blocked from the Switch eShop in North America due to concerns over child gambling.
According to Xalavier Nelson Jr., the game was supposed to launch on the eShop today (May 24th, 2023) but his own media campaign about the game not teaching children to gamble has seemingly convinced Nintendo that it is indeed about child gambling. Whoops.

Strangers decorate their houses with mini slopes and sliding paths, they record their marbles rolling down these elaborate courses, and then they’re posted online for strangers like me to mindlessly enjoy. I’ve now spent the last few nights building my own marble runs - not in real life, because I’m too lazy for the cleanup after - in Zen Marbles, a free playable prototype, out now.

Thank the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti for its mercy, then – assuming you can find one at RRP,  it’s the first of its family not to plonk a price premium over the last-gen equivalent. And even though it’s only moderately faster than the RTX 3060 Ti in most games, its efficiency improvements and DLSS 3 support ensure the RTX 4060 Ti keeps some crowd pleasing potential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.
There are an almost infinite number of roguelikes on the Switch, so it could be easy for you to miss the release of Fights in Tight Spaces. First released on PC and Xbox in December 2021, this is a tactical deck-builder that offers visceral violence and surprisingly deep strategy. The concept of one person against a room full of walking punching bags immediately evokes images of John Wick’s best fight scenes, while turn-based tactics keep the gameplay accessible even to those of us who lack the time to master combos or pixel-perfect platforming.
Playing as the enigmatic Agent 11, you are tasked with infiltrating increasingly dangerous criminal organisations. You get to choose between a male or female-presenting avatar, though your decision doesn’t change anything other than a visible shock of hair as you beat the hell out of waves of faceless goons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swedish developers The Bearded Ladies certainly have a type. If you’ve played the memorably odd Mutant Year Zero or the largely forgettable Corruption 2029, you’ll know it by now – a blend of real-time stealth and turn-based tactics, where you quietly pick off stragglers from enemy squads before confronting the rest in a team scrap. Now here’s Miasma Chronicles, the Ladies’ third effort, and let’s just say they’re clearly happy to stick with what they know.
While the patterns of play are to a great extent the same, though, Miasma Chronicles is a more ambitious project. Addressing criticisms that those earlier games weren’t substantial enough, it’s a broader, denser beast, in which you could easily spend twice as long – 30 hours or so – seeing all the sights and shooting the nasties that populate them. That means there’s a lot more space available for this game to coax out varied strategies and introduce more elements, which is great. But it also means the weaker elements of the formula are left more exposed, which isn’t.

Mortal Kombat 1 is the first entry of the new timeline following the events of Mortal Kombat 11. So far, all we know about its gameplay are Kameo Fighters, a new feature described by NetherRealm Studios as a unique roster of partner fighters that aid players during matches. It feels all but confirmed that we'll see this mechanic in action at SGF alongside the game's other bells and whistles ahead of its September 19 launch. 
Summer Game Fest is the biggest event happening in June, but it's far from the only video game showcase on the horizon. You can keep track of every big livestream taking place around it by checking out our June Summer Game Fest streaming schedule.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was announced in September 2021, it showed off various elements that got players frothing at the mouth for the sequel to one of the greatest superhero games of all time. While seeing Venom emerge from the shadows was extremely exciting, the bulk of the trailer showcased Peter Parker and Miles Morales working side by side to take down several goons in the streets of New York.
That in itself was merely an eyebrow-raising affair, but it's hardly confirmation of cooperative play. However, when Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter responded to a SacAnime panel question about whether or not Spider-Man 2 is a co-op game or not with, "I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so," that added fuel to the fire. 
Yesterday, when a Twitter user asked if the speculation and rumors were true, Insomniac Games unexpectedly jumped in to clear the air. "Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!," the tweet from the official Insomniac Games account said. This seems to fully debunk the speculation from fans and comments from Jeter, and that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will follow in the footsteps of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales in being a fully single-player experience.
Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!
May 22, 2023
This isn't the first time a Spider-Man 2 voice actor has seemingly confirmed details about the game without the permission of the studio or PR team. Back in March, Venom voice actor Tony Todd announced to the world through his Twitter account that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is expected to launch in September of this year, with commercials starting to appear in August. While we are still waiting to see if that pans out better than Jeter's comments about co-op, Todd has since deleted the original tweet. 
With a PlayStation Showcase set to air tomorrow, we might not have long to wait to learn more. For now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda franchise is among the most revered in gaming. Year after year, generation after generation, Nintendo's crack team of developers releases consistently great entries that are almost always Game of the Year contenders. 
For the purpose of remaining focused on the core entries of The Legend of Zelda franchise, several spin-offs and obscure titles are omitted. Titles like Hyrule Warriors, Link's Crossbow Training, Cadence of Hyrule, and the CD-i games are left off. Even with those missing, we still have 21 games where Link battles the forces of evil to save Zelda, Hyrule, or whatever equivalent exists in that respective game. Since the series has been running for more than three decades, we must consider both legacy and impact, as well as how much fun the games are to play …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI, players have asked about a potential PC version of the game, especially given that the PlayStation 5-exclusivity reveal came with a six-month window. Some potential players have assumed when that window is up, a PC version of FFXVI will be released. 
During my FFXVI cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida about a PC version of the game. While it sounds like it’s on the way, he stresses that it will be longer than six months before players see or even possibly hear about it. I’m guessing he mentions six months because of the aforementioned exclusivity window, but he reiterates that this window expiring does not mean the PC version of FFXVI will go live then or anytime soon. 
So for now, and presumably quite a while after the game’s release, if you want to play FFXVI, you’ll need a PlayStation 5.

That's an awesome deal for an 8GB graphics card that delivers excellent RT performance for its tier, AV1 encoding/decoding and a solid upscaling solution in XeSS. If you're in the market for a GPU that can handle 1080p gaming with a relatively modern motherboard that supports the Resizeable BAR feature, this is an awesome pickup for the money.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is possibly one of the most perfectly named games in history. The first bit lets you know you’re playing a game set in the venerable Warhammer 40,000 tabletop universe, while the second bit tells you everything else you need to know. What kind of game is it? Boltgun. What’s the gameplay like? Boltgun! What’s the story? BOLTGUN! Okay, there is technically a story, but it’s a thin excuse to let you shoot crunchy Chaos things in 40k, and shooting things in 40k means BOLTGUN!!!
Boltgun is a retro-styled first-person shooter, or boomer shooter, to use the parlance of our times. Cast as a Space Marine, one of 40k’s genetically engineered fascist super soldiers, it’s your job to secure the Plot Device and prevent 40k’s already crappy Imperium from getting even crappier. As you can probably guess, this means running around at incredible speeds and shooting hordes of cultists, traitors and daemons in the face until they fall down, explode into chunks of bright red gore, or both.

As a development team, the members of Piccolo Studio have an apparent interest in artistic interactive representations of uncomfortable realities. Their previous project, Arise: A Simple Story, was an affecting and powerful portrayal of death and heartbreak. After Us has broader ambitions, telling an allegorical tale about life after humanity and the complicated and often-devastating relationship we have always had with nature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse set to arrive in theaters in just over a week, it should come as no surprise that Fortnite is adding some items and costumes to the most expansive IP crossover in gaming history. As teased yesterday, Miles Morales and Miguel O'Hara (AKA Spider-Man 2099) are joining Fortnite in promotion of the highly anticipated film.
The new additions, which include reskinned Spider-Man's Web-Shooters – now called Spider-Verse Web-Shooters – and two new Outfits, accompany Spider-Man themed Week 11 Quests. Epic Games teases that the Web-Shooters, in particular, will come in handy in those Quests. While most of those Quests award XP, one will give you the "Silk & Cologne (EI8HT version)" lobby track from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.
If this sounds up your alley, you can find the Spider-Verse Web-Shooters on the ground or by exchanging bars for them from Spider-Gwen. You can also find the Spider-Man (Miles Morales) Outfit, which includes the masked Earth 1610 alt style and the Spider-Verse Portal Back Bling, as well as the Spider-Man 2099 Outfit, which includes the 2099 Web Cape Back Bling, in the Item Shop. These items, along with other accessories, can be purchased as part of the Across the Spider-Verse Bundle. That bundle includes the Mega City Swing Loading Screen.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse arrives in theaters on June 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it was announced in February, Samba de Amigo: Party Central excited many who look back on the 2000 Dreamcast/Arcade title with a nostalgic fondness. The rhythm game, which tasks players with shaking maracas to the beat of popular songs, finally has a concrete release date. Players can expect to transform their Joy-Cons into maracas when the Switch-exclusive title launches on August 29. 
Samba de Amigo: Party Central's launch soundtrack already features 40 popular tracks from artists like Ariana Grande, Kesha, Nicki Minaj, and Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as some tracks from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Forces. While "City Escape" and "Fist Bump" from those games are a part of the launch lineup, fans of Sega's lineup of games can anticipate even more content from Sonic, as well as other Sega franchises, through downloadable content.
The Sonic Music DLC Pack includes "Open Your Heart" from Sonic Adventure, "Reach for the Stars" from Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and "I'm Here" from Sonic Frontiers. The Sega Music DLC Pack includes "Bakamitai (Taxi Driver Edition)" from the Yakuza series, "Go Go Cheer Girl!" from Space Channel 5: Part 2, and "Rhythm Thief Theme" from "Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure.
All of these DLC tracks are included as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition, which will be available on the Nintendo eShop for $50. The Digital Deluxe version also includes special costumes for Sonic, Tails, Space Channel 5, Super Monkey Ball, and Puyo Puyo, further hammering home the Sega theme in this game. The standard edition costs $40.
Samba de Amigo: Party Central arrives on Switch on August 29. For more on the game, check out our coverage of the announcement and see the first trailer here.]]></summary>

"It's not you, it's me", rings true here, as it's definitely not the fault of the video games. I trust that Phoenix Wright or Paranormasight are brilliant, but the sudden act of having to read lots in a game has never worked out for me.
Then Citizen Sleeper came along for this month's RPS Game Club - and I think I'm a changed man? I think I now get why people are excited about static images and dialogue boxes. And I'm certain it's the game's cyclic nature that's managed to lasso my brain and keep it focused on the task at hand: help an AI trapped in a vending machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). 
I'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that Sony have been making increasing efforts to bring their exclusive PlayStation games to PC over the last couple of years, but one thing they've never quite been clear about is when we can expect to see them. They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. 
According to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only "acceptable" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetEase Games has announced the founding of a new game studio based in Canada. The studio is headed up by Sean Crooks, a former Ubisoft producer with credits ranging from Just Dance and Driver to the Watch Dogs franchise. Other members of the team include developers who have worked on series like Splinter Cell, Army of Two, Far Cry, and Child of Light.
The team hopes its first project will kickstart a new franchise. The title is an open-world, story-driven action/adventure title that draws inspiration from '80s action and horror films. Bad Brain is using Unreal Engine 5 to develop its debut title, which will launch across multiple platforms.
"I'm honored to be leading this talented team of developers in Canada," Crooks said in a press release. "We're all passionate about creating memorable and meaningful experiences. NetEase Games has given us a warm welcome, with an abundance of support and creative freedom to allow us to do what we do best. Our first game is a passion project that gives us the opportunity to truly free our brains."
NetEase, which is based in China, views this as an investment in the Canadian game-development industry. "We're thrilled to welcome Bad Brain Game Studios into our family and enriching our presence in Canada," NetEase Games president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu said in that same release. "With this new studio, NetEase Games continues its commitment to nurturing top-tier talent in Canada and creating games that players love. Canada has a thriving gaming industry, and we're excited to continue to be a part of it. We believe that our talented teams in Toronto, Montreal, and beyond will create some of the most innovative and exciting games the industry has seen."
Bad Brain Game Studios will have offices in Toronto, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec, and will operate using a hybrid work model. To learn more, you can visit the studio's official website.]]></summary>

A complaint filed by several TV companies claims that when a pirate site's URL is entered into Downloader's basic web browser, the pirate site appears, violating an injunction. The same companies won an injunction in 2022 that required every ISP in the U.S. to block the very same site - until Google and other tech giants prevented that happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has said he thinks "Maybe it's time we removed the numbers" from Final Fantasy games. In an interview with GQ, he talked about the baggage that inevitably comes with having a 35-year-old series with soon to be 16 numbered mainline games in it (not including the sequels and spin-offs, I might add), and the confusion it continues to create with new players. "Every numbered title we release in the series, we have to go into it like, 'It's OK, you don't have to play the rest of them,'" he said, and removing them is "something that I've discussed with the higher-ups". It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely. As long as they don't pull a Mortal Kombat and go back to 1, though, we're good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last july I was given the opportunity to play an early beta for Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer shooter that pits you and a bunch of your mech suit-wearing buddies against unstoppable raptor hordes. In the nine months since I took command of a T-Rex and did a sick backflip, my life has not known peace. “I’m really excited to play Exoprimal” I’ll say to colleagues, unprompted, in important meetings unrelated to anything prehistoric in nature. “From what I've played, it blends PvE and PvP gameplay into a single multiplayer mode that feels very unique and hugely entertaining”. My tax return was voided because I drew a big stegosaurus on it. I have renamed the cat “Sniper Neosaur”, and I am disappointed that she has yet to emerge from a gooey purple orb.


It was my delight, then, to be given the opportunity to sit down with key members of the game’s development team to discuss Exoprimal’s inspirations, its inevitable comparisons to Dino Crisis and how Capcom plans to use it as a template for their live-service games moving forward. Alongside a fresh opportunity to check out the game, I hopped onto a Zoom call with Exoprimal’s director Takuro Hiraoka, technical director Kazuki Abe and art director Takuro Fuse.

Exoprimal’s time-traveling, dinosaur-blasting premise firmly positions it as one of the strangest multiplayer shooters on the horizon. Players have gotten to sample its insanity in a previous open beta, but a recent hands-on preview gave me a chance to peek into the game’s storytelling structure and customization. 
As a quick primer, Exoprimal tasks you and four other friends to team up to battle waves of invading dinosaurs. Outfitted in specialized exosuits, you’ll blast apart velociraptors, triceratops, and mighty T-Rexes in a race to finish missions befor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now you can pick up a great deal on a powerful RTX 4070 Ti gaming PC over at CCL, equipped with a Core i5 12400F processor, 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM, an MSI Pro B660M-E motherboard and 1TB Kingston NV2 NVMe SSD - all for £1260. That's an awesome spec for gaming at 1080p, 1440p and even 4K - such is the power of this mighty GPU!  
To get this price, plus two freebies - a copy of Diablo 4 (£60) and a gaming headset (£30) - select the "No OS" option and use code GAMER40 at the checkout. 
You can of course opt to get Windows preinstalled if you prefer, but you can also use a USB stick and any unused Windows keys you've already got, including those from previous versions of Windows, to install the OS yourself. And, as the Steam Deck proves, gaming on Linux is getting pretty damn good - and of course, Linux is completely free (as in beer and as in speech).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the PlayStation 3 generation, updates released on a game’s launch day, colloquially known as Day One patches or updates, have been the norm. Sometimes they’re small, squashing a few last-minute bugs, but other times, they’re massive and nigh essential to enjoying the adventure before you. 
However, Day One patches draw criticism from players excited to jump into the action, only to be left watching a download bar fill up. Some players with slower internet or limited access might be left waiting for hours, if not days, depending on download speeds. During my Final Fantasy XVI cover story trip, I asked the team about its March accomplishment of going gold and what the team was working on now. 
Final Fantasy XVI has gone gold.
#FF16's launch on June 22nd 🐺 pic.twitter.com/Vrtd3cMNW5
March 31, 2023
To my surprise, developer Creative Business Unit III isn’t working on a day one patch, a revelation that continues to become rarer with each new release in games. Director Hiroshi Takai gave me a few reasons as to why. 
The first is that the team is confident in its final build of Final Fantasy XVI. The second is that he and producer Naoki Yoshida (and the rest of the CBUIII team) believe the game should be ready to go at launch, recognizing that not everyone has access to the internet needed to download a day one patch in light of Final Fantasy XVI’s global simultaneous release. So as of right now, we won’t be downloading a big patch on June 22 when the game hits PlayStation 5. 
However, Takai notes that CBUIII is testing the game daily and searching for bugs, and things could change as a result, but right now, like in the days of old Final Fantasy, this entry should work entirely as expected out of the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last six years, my Skyrim wood elf has been stuck in some godforsaken cave in goodness knows what corner of Tamriel. I don't remember why they were there, or what goal they were trying to achieve. It was just 'one of those caves' that looked cool and interesting when I came across it and I thought, 'Yeah, all right, let's have a go then, shall we?' But while other Skyrim caves I'd come across could be easily polished off in an office lunch-time - as that was often how I played Skyrim back then - this one was different somehow. It was so large and twisty, so infinitely befuddling, that I seemed to be trapped down there forever. Sure, I could have probably turned back, but I'd been down there for ages, and felt like I'd come too far to simply not see it all through to the bitter end. But the end never came, and I eventually abandoned my save as a result, whisked off by the prospect of newer, more exciting games that didn't involve trying to figure out how to escape its narrow, bioluminescent hellscape.
Worse still, this disastrous feat of orienteering has now become my overriding memory of Skyrim. For all its great sidequests and its ever-increasing number of excellent mods, all I ever think about are its damn caves. Just the thought of loading up that save file again makes me grimace, and I'm starting to dread the thought of getting stuck in another one whenever the heck The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. But I've been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this past week, and cor, I'm immediately jealous of Link's Ascend ability. As part of his new slate of powers, Ascend lets him instantly woosh through almost any ceiling as long as there's a traversable bit of terrain above it. That kind of power wouldn't have been half handy for my poor old wood elf, and it's precisely what makes exploring Tears Of The Kingdom's caves so enjoyable. So if there's one thing The Elder Scrolls 6 should steal take note of, please let it be this.

The G920 is the Xbox-oriented model, meaning it works on PC plus Xbox Series and One consoles, while the G29 is for PC plus PS4 and PS5 - so choose what's most useful to you!

So far, Remedy have only committed to a general 2023 release for Alan Wake 2, but voice actor Matthew Porretta told the Monsters, Madness And Magic podcast that it's "supposed to come out in October". That means it should be well clear of ye olde Starfield, but that "supposed to" also suggests the date isn't set in stone yet. Here's hoping we get a more formal date at this year's Summer Games Fest, perhaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI was surprise revealed in 2020 as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, and Square Enix and PlayStation have remained closely aligned throughout its showings since then. Be it State of Plays, PlayStation Showcases, or even PlayStation Blogs, it’s clear Final Fantasy XVI is a big release for Sony. 
During my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida how developer Creative Business Unit III feels about the game’s PS5 exclusivity and what that does for the studio in terms of development. He says it’s important to distinguish that CBUIII doesn’t go into game development thinking it wants to limit a game to just one platform or company. When the team started development on FFXVI, the studio “looked at all options,” Yoshida says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All Elite Wrestling fans have anxiously awaited the company’s first video game AEW: Fight Forever, since its announcement in 2020. That wait finally comes to an end next month.
As announced by AEW star and executive VP Kenny Omega in the trailer below, Fight Forever is launching on June 29. Developed by the former long-time maker of WWE games Yuke’s and published by THQ Nordic, the game serves as a throwback to the ‘90s-era AKI-engine arcade-style games like WCW/nWo Revenge and WWF No Mercy (even enlisting the expertise of No Mercy director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita).


Fight Forever includes over 10 gameplay modes, including a Career Mode, online play, and a full customization suite that lets players create wrestlers, teams, move sets, entrances, and arenas. Match-types include: 
Singles
Tag-Team
3-Way
4-Way
Ladder Match
Casino Battle Royale
Falls Count Anywhere
Unsanctioned Lights Out
Exploding Barbed Wire Death Match
The complete roster has still not been shared officially, but here are the wrestlers we know are in the game based on previous reveals, interviews, and videos. Keep in mind that this is almost certainly not the entire playable roster: 
Abadon
Adam Cole
Adam Page
Bryan Danielson
Chris Jericho
CM Punk (probably)
Cody Rhodes (yes, really)
Darby Allin
Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D.
Hikaru Shida
Jade Cargill
Jon Moxley
Jungle Boy
Kenny Omega
Kris Statlander
Matt Hardy
Matt Jackson 
Miro
MJF
Nick Jackson 
Nyla Rose
Orange Cassidy
Owen Hart
Paul Wight
Pentagon
Sting
Thunder Rosa
Yuka Sakazaki
AEW: Fight Forever is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

I played Final Fantasy XVI during a recent preview event in February, but it was focused almost entirely on combat. I enjoyed the combat a lot – you can read my thoughts here – but my latest hands-on with the game happened during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices. I played a few hours of the game, which is what everyone who’s part of this latest wave of previews played, and that’s what I’ll be talking about here. 
But I also saw never-before-seen gameplay, received an exclusive tour of some areas in FFXVI, learned about its endgame, and more for this month’s Game Infor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet of Lana has all the hallmarks of a story-rich platformer. Across its six-hour run time, you'll encounter a string of environmental puzzles, an evil plan concocted by a group of baddies, a rich orchestral soundtrack that swells at all the right moments, a cute animal companion, and a gorgeous world that needs saving. 
On paper, it has everything you could possibly want from this kind of game, but in practice, it can also be Lana's undoing at times. It does everything well - admittedly some much better than others - but it feels like this sci-fi tale is missing something. That gut punch, that sigh of relief after a thrill, that unexpected surprise... You know, that extra edge to really make it sing. It’s still a very enjoyable adventure, but its lack of emotional highs means it doesn't linger long in the memory once you've seen the credits roll. Is that a roundabout way to say that Planet of Lana is a solid 7/10? Maybe, but we don't do that here.

Since the release of Limbo in 2010, cinematic puzzle platformers have relied on capturing players’ attention and imagination with beautiful art directions and compelling, often enigmatic storytelling. As typically brief experiences, the moment-to-moment puzzles must hit hard with clever, memorable obstacles and not meander by rehashing familiar mechanics too often. Planet of Lana almost hits this sweet spot by boasting a gorgeous presentation, but trekking through this strange world doesn’t always inspire the same awe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a soft spot for Overdungeon, a maximalist real-time mashup of tower defense and collectible card game, and I sang its praises three years ago. Its developers, Pocketpair, haven't updated it since, instead pouring their work into similarly expansive "everything game" Craftopia and the Pokémon-alike (but with guns) Palworld.

Now Pocketpair have released a content update for Overdungeon and say that previous radio silence was because they were "a bit tired and struggled with our contract with the publisher."

He's the ultimate evil that necessitates the perpetual rebirth of the legendary hero. Since Ganon takes several incarnations over the course of the games, we decided to rank his various appearances in the Legend of Zelda franchise.
Before you proceed, be warned: This list contains spoilers for all the games listed, though we did try to be appropriately vague for the Tears of the Kingdom entry for now.
For this list, we excluded Demise from Skyward Sword, as that isn't Ganon, as much as it is the evil force that will eventually create Ganon. We also left Hyrule Warriors Ganon off, as that version exi…]]></summary>

All those themes suggest a heavy, self-serious game. But Kujlevka's great strength is its levity. While not particularly funny, its consistent wry humour perfectly counterbalances all the talk of political chaos, existential futility, and petty greed. Its opening should have been a clue, really, considering you hang out with skeletons while drinking and commenting on the food on a train in outer space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the various corporatised fictional universes out there, Star Wars is the one I'm most emotionally invested in. But my affection for George Lucas' brain-baby is less about the stories and characters, and more about the general vibe of the galaxy itself. I love its retro-futurist junkpunk style, the rusty spaceships, dusty planets, and fusty aliens. That's why I've more fondness for games like Dark Forces and KotOR than any of the films or TV shows, as they let me poke around locations like Tatooine and Ord Mantell at my own pace.


Hence, the idea of being properly, immerse in Star Wars, to be physically surrounded by it and able to touch it, is probably my ultimate VR fantasy. Sod the imaginatively inert virtual spaces of Horizon Worlds, if Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to sell the Metaverse to me, he'd build the whole thing out in Mos Eisely chic, and let me run my own virtual cantina selling NFT space-drinks to legless bounty hunters and idiot Web3 prospectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Game Boy Advance library of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting a Mario-infused shot in the arm with the addition of three Super Mario Advance titles.
On May 26, Super Mario Advance, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, and Yoshi’s Island: Super Mario Advance 3 hit the service. First released throughout the early 2000s, these games are enhanced portable remakes of Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, respectively. 


Although the original versions of each game are already available in the NES/SNES libraries, the Advance series features several tweaks, such as Advance 2 giving Luigi his Super Mario Bros. 2 jump. These join Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, which was in the initial batch of GBA titles, to complete the series. As a reminder, the GBA library is part of the Expansion Pack tier, the pricier upgraded version of Nintendo Switch Online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for about a week, but yesterday marked the launch of its first post-release patch. Version 1.1.1 of the game fixes one very specific problem, but also ambiguously addresses issues to improve the gameplay experience. You find the patch notes below, as well as on Nintendo's website.
Fixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.
	
If you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.
Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.
Despite both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild being incredibly solid games out of the gate, even Zelda is not immune to patches, but Nintendo tends to keep the changes vague. Many of Breath of the Wild's patch notes simply pointed to the updates making the game a more pleasant experience. It seems the trajectory of Tears of the Kingdom's patch notes might receive the same ambiguous details if the second bullet point is an indication of what's to come.
For more on Zelda, you can read Game Informer's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, our beginner tips guide, our interview with producer and director Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi, our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo guide, this feature of stupid screenshots, and a tip of how to find interesting sidequests.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Does that pommel horse have a grenade launcher?" is one of many bizarre questions I found myself asking while playing HROT. This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.
The year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this week. It’s good. Really good. I know you’ve all been waiting for your favourite PC gaming-focused website to offer their take on it so there you go. It’s properly, properly good. The best open-world adventure since Elden Ring, except arguably better because it doesn’t pull your trousers down and point out the colour of your underwear every time you dare to explore a forest or watch a sunset.


As you’ve probably seen, the game’s biggest new draw is “Ultrahand”, which allows Link to pick up loose objects and glue them together. Three logs make a raft. A plank and four wheels make a car. Two stones and a log make a... Ahem. You get the idea. In addition to this are “Zonai Devices”, components that give life and movement to your doohickeys. A fan pushes your raft across the lake. A steering stick lets you manoeuvre your little car. It’s a marvellous construction system that leverages the pre-existing physics engine seen in the game’s predecessor, Breath Of The Wild, to startling results. Does this all sound familiar?

Playing under-the-bed peekaboo with brainwashed killers can be an overwhelming ordeal, so now you can drag along a friend and spread out the trauma. This time, those snotty shakycam Blair Witch-type chases are set in a Cold War-era facility where you’ll be put through some gruelling experiments. The early access launch trailer below lays out some of the titular trials you can expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Strange Scaffold have announced another genre-blending adventure, Teenage Demon Slayer Society, this time mixing turn-based strategy combat with some character action flare. The game follows teen figurines, who are already struggling with the hellish world of high school crushes when an army of demons invades their world. Demonic invasions and teenage angst are - as we all know - a match made in heaven. Or hell. Either way it looks cool.

Ergotron make some of the best monitor arms around - reliable, capable and generally brilliant - but they're also pretty pricey. That's probably why Amazon hit up Ergotron to make its Amazon Basics monitor arms, which offer the same excellent quality in unbranded form for considerably less money. 
Today though one of these arms is even better value than usual, as there's a ridiculous 40% off voucher available on Amazon's take on the Ergotron LX, dropping this high-end monitor arm from £81 to just £49. That's a brilliant price for an arm that can support monitors up to 11kg in weight with full tilt, swivel, rotation and height adjustability.

Unlike those drives though, the MP600 Pro LPX comes with a heatsink by default and is often priced more aggressively, making it a great value choice that doesn't sacrifice performance. Today this drive has dropped to £74.98 on Amazon UK, a historic low price that makes it easy to justify an SSD upgrade for your PC or PS5.

So I was excited when publishers 505 Games announced singleplayer follow-up Hawken Reborn on Monday then launched it into early access two days later. Having now played it, oh dear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's difficult not to start out by namedropping Dwarf Fortress. Songs Of Syx will compare to probably every colony sim you've played, in fact, but it feels like a fundamentally different game conceptually.
The usual parts are there. Chop some trees, chip some stones, and chep some crops to get your pioneers' basic needs met, then get to expanding. But Syx isn't interested in testing you or manufacturing drama. It's not about surviving, not about building a happy little colony. It's about how growth changes not just the scale, but the nature of a settlement. Despite similarities with its influences, it defines itself with a different dynamic, a whole different ethos to its peers. And it's one that even playing it my own awkward way hasn't broken.

We (attempt to) talk about our favourite Zelda games of the past, our favourite Zelda-likes on PC, and I explain how Tears Of The Kingdom works to Nate and James. Honestly though, we don't make it very far, because it turns out the lads haven't ever played a Zelda game before. At least, Nate might have. We're not entirely sure. 


We do also talk about what we've been playing this week as well - which include some old favourites, some new secrets, and Gaben's tiny hands - and give some great new recommendations. Nate also delivers a very involved mini-game involving beans and aliens, and James doesn't talk about the Asus ROG Ally.

The award-winning game takes place in the 18th century and tasks you with solving a mystery spanning decades over 11 bizarre, interconnected deaths. Each scenario is presented as static scenes where players must carefully observe the environment to find clues revealing who each character is, how the person died, and the chronological order of events. The Spider of Lanka serves as a prequel that adds three additional cases. 
The Switch version sports a redesigned UI to better accommodate a controller-based experience. If this is the first you've heard of the game, the trailer below provides a good idea of what to expect.


As a fan of The Case of the Golden Idol, it's great to see it come to more platforms, and Switch should be an especially good fit. Will you be giving the game a shot on Switch? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Halfway between sequel and reboot, this newest game is set a thousand years after 2014’s original game of the same name, and features all the dark fantasy tropes you love from the Soulslike subgenre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Hero Ultra Rumble, the upcoming battle royale based on the popular manga and anime, My Hero Academia, is holding an open beta that begins later this month.
The beta begins May 25 at 7 p.m. PT and concludes June 1 at 11 p.m. PT on PlayStation 4. It appears all you have to do to participate is download the beta to play, which you can preload by going here.


The game features 24 player matches divided into eight teams of three, with players selecting their favorite heroes and villains from the franchise and taking advantage of their various unique abilities. You can also upgrade your abilities with pick-ups on the map and support your teammates as needed.
The upcoming beta is only for PlayStation 4 (playable on PlayStation 5), but the game is planned for release on Xbox, Switch, and PC, as well. Bandai Namco does not have a proper release date for the game yet, but it will be free-to-play when it officially launches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego 2K Drive has stirred up a surprising amount of thoughts, perhaps moreso than any other video game so far this year. I think it's because the game is an open world kart racer, a combination of words that sing to my nostalgic love for old-school racers, where as a kid I'd worshipped the majesty of Muppets Race Mania and Mario Kart (this is the only time I mention Mario Kart). In all respects, 2K Drive nails Lego's historically strong presentation, with slick courses and a genuinely lovely combo of grassy hills and dusty plains which certainly seem like a chip off Forza Horizon's shiny paint job. Building is upheld too, as a mighty garage lets anyone create an interesting set of wheels. The wheels start spinning, though, as the live service gates start closing. I don't think the gates totally shut off what's meant to be a fun time, but it certainly tries. Even an innocent kart racer can't escape the perils of live service, it seems.

Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>
