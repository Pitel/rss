The first trailer from the upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie — unsurprisingly named The Super Mario Bros. Movie — has been revealed in a special Nintendo Direct presentation, and we've got our first official look at Mario. Early fan reaction seems to be positive, although there are lots of people on Twitter who think Mario in his movie guise looks a little familiar.

Specifically, there's chatter suggesting that the plumber bears more than a passing resemblance to Fix-It Felix, the handyman hero from Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.

Well, we've now officially seen the first teaser trailer of The Super Mario Bros. Movie and heard Chris Pratt speak as the voice of Mario for the very first time. In case you forgot though, he's just one of many around the world who will be voicing the character.
Universal has also uploaded trailers of The Super Mario Bros. Movie in French, Spanish, Italian, and various other languages. The French one, in particular, is getting quite a lot of praise. Here's a round-up (thanks, GoNintendo):

Well there you have it folks. After much speculation we have finally received our first look at the Mario movie, now officially titled The Super Mario Bros. Movie. For a teaser, we got a surprisingly good look at what is in store for us come April 7th, 2023, and if we're being honest, we were pretty darn impressed.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie Teaser Trailer Is Finally Here

Now yes, there was not a lot of Mario to be seen this time around - perhaps a sign that the studio remain worried about the audience backlash to Chris Pratt's voice casting - but there is still much to look forward to. As if there was any doubt, we know that Jack Black is going to be having a huge amount of fun with Bowser and overall it looks like Illumination is doing a decent job of bringing the Mushroom Kingdom to the big screen.

Back in the early Overwatch days, something I would look forward to every year was the seasonal events, particularly the ones that had PvE, story mode-type missions. Overwatch’s characters are a big part of what makes the game feel so special. The game was always more than just the multiplayer experience — it was the comics and the animated shorts and the seasonal story events, too. Having opportunities to dive into battle and see not only the history of the characters and the maps from the game, but actually seeing them work together as a team in-universe — that was a pretty magical feeling, if you ask me.
Even with all the new changes Blizzard promised when it came to the PvP, I was most excited to see some kind of story mode in Overwatch 2. I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now's your chance to snap Deathloop for cheap
If you ask me, Humble Bundle is one of the best ways to get your games. If you need recommendations, they never steer you wrong with their pre-made bundles, they prop up small indie creators who likely wouldn't get a platform otherwise, and a lot of times they raise a ton of money for worthy causes with their charity bundles. This October, they're shining a light on one of the best games of last year: Deathloop, Arkane's time-looping first-person shooter mystery roguelite.
That's some serious video game word salad, but trust me when I say it delivers on all of those fronts. Deathloop is a slick, stylish game with a unique premise and some of the best game voice acting performances of late, and personally I feel like it deserved even more hype than it already got.
A lot of people may not know that you can even become a monthly subscriber to Humble Bundle Choice for $12 a month, which gives you a whole slew of free games every month that you get to keep after you've cancelled your subscription. Members also have access to a rotating library of games you can play, as well as discount codes. It's another gaming subscription service, but overall it's a good deal if you like the kinds of games that they have.

Enter Deathloop, one of the free games on offer this month, along with seven other titles:
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope
Disciples: Liberation
Epic Chef
Golf Gang
Maid of Sker
Monster Train First Class (Collector's Edition)
Railroad Corporation
If you've yet to play Deathloop, this is a great opportunity to give it a try. Even if you're only subscribed for a month, you'll get all of the games on offer for $12, plus all the other benefits listed above, so it seems pretty worth it to me.

With The Super Mario Bros. Movie getting its first official trailer today, we finally got to see many of the characters in Illumination's animation style for the first time. And a highlight of the trailer was Luigi, who appeared very briefly at the end of the teaser. And it's more than appropriate for the panic-stricken brother
In the teaser, Luigi is running away from several Dry Bones towards a castle (we've timestamped the specific section in the teaser below). There's plenty of lava, and the green brother looks pretty terrified as he scarpers away from the skeletal enemies. Then, he attempts to keep even more foes from escaping the castle by holding the doors shut as best as he can, all with a horrified look on his face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bayonetta 3's first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage. Since the light-worshipping Sages were rivals to the da…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turns out I'm 100% a gamer
Lizzo has been one of the most prolific pop artists of the last few years, releasing bop after endlessly catchy bop. She made news recently by elegantly playing the former president James Madison's crystal flute in the Library of Congress, reminding us that she's not just a great performer, but also a highly trained musician. Lizzo has brought fresh, bright sounds to pop that have been missing for a while, and she's also done a lot to give back after all of her success. If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of hers, so it's cool to see her influence cross over into the games space. Considering Lizzo's contributions to modern pop music, it was only a matter of time that she was immortalized by one of the highest honors in the land -- her own Beat Saber DLC pack.
As something of a Beat Saber aficionado myself, I can say with confidence that Lizzo's upbeat, bubbly, and groovy pop songs are nothing short of perfect for the VR rhythm game. The pack will also a include special environment that is themed after Lizzo's newest album, Special, featuring purple and yellow blocks, a rainbow, and Lizzo's name spelled out in lights.

The pack's full track list includes:
"Be Loved (Am I Ready)"
"About Damn Time"
"Cuz I Love You"
"Everybody's Gay"
"Good as Hell"
"Juice"
"Tempo (ft. Missy Elliot)"
"Truth Hurts"
"Worship"
The new song pack is out today, and goes for $11.99, or $1.99 per individual song. It's been a minute since I've played because of how annoying it is to redownload my Beat Saber mods every time the game updates, but considering this is an officially released song pack that won't give me that same issue, it might be time for me to dust off the Oculus after a few months away.

The first official trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie is finally out. Revealed during a Nintendo Direct and also broadcast at New York Comic Con, Illumination's take on Mario has at least been revealed to the world in a short teaser.
During the trailer, we get our first look at Bowser, Mario, Toad, and Luigi, alongside a bunch of Koopas, Kamek, and Dry Bones. We also get to hear many of these characters for the first time too. Oh, and there were some very angry penguins, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mario movie leaps into action on April 7
Well, it's finally here. Today, we got the world premiere trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, from Nintendo and Illumination.
Shown off during a special Nintendo Direct today, we got a little bit of info from Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination's Chris Meledandri on the putting-together of this collaboration.
Then, we got to see the trailer. We see an intro scene of Bowser and Kamek arriving to overthrow a penguin kingdom, eventually grabbing a star in the process. Then, we pan over to see Chris Pratt's Mario, hearing his take on the iconic plumber for the first time alongside a big look at the Mushroom Kingdom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPpazvJrHm0
Mario goes to the movies
Reports of Nintendo and Illumination's team-up first started in 2017. In the time since, we've had a few crumbs here and there, including a full voice cast reveal last year. Alongside Pratt's role as Mario, several celebrities are set to lend their talents, ranging from Charlie Day as Luigi to Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Both of those got a little spotlight in today's trailer too, though the main show was Mario and Bowser.
The video game-movie adaptation pipeline has certainly grown over the last few years. Sonic the Hedgehog has had two major motion pictures and more is on the way, leading the way for many more. PlayStation has been kicking up its own productions, with an Uncharted movie already out and The Last of Us headed to HBO.
This obviously isn't Mario's first silver screen appearance, but it's a pretty big one. I will say, Jack Black's Bowser works pretty well for me. As for some of the others, I'm going to need to hear more (I was a little bummed we didn't hear more of Day as Luigi, or see Princess Peach at all).
The Super Mario Bros. Movie hits theaters on April 7, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt's Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is "unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world," and it turns out he's right in that we've never heard Pratt's voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie's villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you'd expect, in line with Illumination's other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

Valve has finally opened up orders for its official Steam Deck Dock. The page went live today, with reservations open for anyone who wants to pick up a new resting spot for Steam Deck.
The official Valve Steam Deck Dock goes for $89. As of the time of this writing, it lists an estimated delivery date of one to two weeks, though that could shift.
This USB-C Dock acts as an extension, essentially, for a Steam Deck. It's got HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4 connections for external displays, alongside three USB-A 3.1 Gen1 ports and a Gigabit Ethernet port.
Linking the Deck to the Deck is a USB-C captive cable with a special low-profile, right-angle connector so it slots in right on top. This also acts as a power delivery source.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvokyBOYe8Y
Steam power
In an FAQ question on the order page, Valve confirms the Steam Deck Dock comes with both the Docking Station and a power supply cable, the same one as the one that came with the Deck.
While Valve says it's tested on a wide range of displays and peripherals, it also asks users to note in the Steam forums if their setup is not compatible.
Importantly, the Docking Station will not increase the performance of the Steam Deck. The Dock just allows for charging and connectivity. The Dock can also be used without a power supply, though Valve notes the USB ports will have reduced throughput to conserve power in this configuration.
For those who haven't got a Steam Deck yet, it also seems like orders are continuing to speed up. Users were reporting short delivery times earlier today, though that's been shifting and will shift depending on demand. Valve has stated that it's moving through reservations faster than expected, so this might be a decent time to try nabbing a Steam Deck for the holidays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day, another purchase
Bandai Namco Entertainment has announced that it has increased its stake in Limbic Entertainment, becoming a majority shareholder in the German studio, best known for the strategy sequel Tropico 6.
"This investment is much more than a strategic move for Bandai Namco," writes Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe CEO Arnaud Muller in a press release. "For the past three years, we have worked together on the creation of new IPs. The first game Park Beyond will be released in 2023 but there is much more to come. This investment is just the continuity of our existing relationship, and we will help Limbic become the new reference in strategy and simulation games.”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ROFu9dnqxQ
"With Bandai Namco we are very lucky to have a partner who shares our goals, values and commitment to develop amazing titles," agrees Limbic Entertainment co-founder and CEO Stephan Winter. "Working together up to this point has already shown the trust and mutual respect that characterizes our relationship. Solidifying this bond gives us the opportunity to up our game — to plan even more ambitiously and bring Limbic Entertainment to the next level."
Bandai Namco previously purchased a minority stake in Limbic back in February 2021, as the studio began its work on the aforementioned new-gen park builder, Park Beyond, to be published by Bandai Namco once development is complete. Clearly, over the ensuing time period, the publisher has seen potential in Limbic, and has thus taken steps to tuck the indie outfit and its 100-strong staff further under its wing.
Park Beyond is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Devolver Digital's comically unnerving roguelike, Cult of the Lamb, has ironically become something of a cult hit itself, winning over fans with its creepy-cute visuals, anarchic attitude, and engaging gameplay — In fact, Massive Monster's indie hit has already bagged its first Game of the Year award, courtesy of the Australian Game Developer Awards.
The event, which took place on the evening on October 4, recognized the best of interactive entertainment from 2022 to date, focusing mostly on the output of independent studios working within the region. Cult of the Lamb scuttled off with four well-deserved gongs, including Excellence in Art, Excellence in Music, Excellence in Gameplay, and the aforementioned Game of the Year award.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mode won't have any buy-in anymore
Unknown Worlds' Moonbreaker recently dropped into Early Access, allowing players to buy in and test it out. And in response to that feedback, the studio is already removing one element: the Cargo Run's Contracts.
Cargo Run is a game mode in Moonbreaker where players can carry over, battle-to-battle, in order to build up a streak and win rewards. Playing through rounds, you still play typical Moonbreaker. Fight another team with your squad, defeat the Captain, and move on. If you fail, you drop the Cargo Run.
Playing these Cargo Runs initially cost a Contract. It's not too dissimilar from how Hearthstone handles its Arena draft mode. Along the way, you can pick up cargo during matches for power boosts to your chosen squad, and get Blanks, a type of currency in Moonbreaker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA_ApUlmD6A
Dropping some cargo
Players, however, didn't seem to like this set-up. Moonbreaker costs money to buy into already, and having an additional fee on top to play the Cargo Run mode didn't seem to sit right.
In a post titled the "Cargo Run Update", the Moonbreaker team confirms it's removing Contracts from the game entirely.
"While our intent was always for players to be able to earn enough Blanks during Cargo Run to continually unlock additional Contracts to play, we understand the community’s collective frustration that this mode felt gated and the desire to have any possible limitation removed," the blog reads.
Any players who purchased Contracts using Pulsars or Blanks before this change will get the full amount of relevant currency refunded. Any Contracts still in your player inventory will be converted to Blanks. And as the game is being adjusted for unlimited Cargo Run play, Blanks will not be on the reward table for the mode any more. Season Track XP will still be earnable, though.

Kao the Kangaroo is one of many video game stars who will be getting into the spooky spirit this Halloween, with Tate Multimedia announcing a new paid DLC drop for the anarchic antipodean's recent comeback title. The Oh! Well DLC bundle will launch on all platforms October 13.
The new DLC includes five all-new Eternal Well stages to conquer, each sporting creepy variants on its villains and a Burton-esque color scheme, adding to the supernatural vibe. As Kao punches his way through each stage, he will also unlock a selection of five freaky skins, which will be perfect for October 31, when yer bouncy boy goes trick or treating. You can check out the new content in the trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp2YhX-23nQ
The Kao the Kangaroo sequel launched last summer, following a successful player campaign to bring the marvelous marsupial back to the world of mascot platformers. While the new title will be unashamedly over-familiar for fans of another 3D platform hero, Kao the Kangaroo is a fun, attractive, and charming adventure — definitely worth checking out for genre fans. In fact, from October 13, players can pick up the original game, all previous DLC, and the new Halloween bundle for a special $34.99 bundle price.
Kao the Kangaroo is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch — The Oh! Well Halloween DLC bundle launches October 13 on all platforms, priced at around $7.

It would perhaps be the understatement of the year to say that Splatoon 3 has been a big hit. The game has broken records with the sheer quantity of sales that it has made in Japan and the same can be said across the world. The game has been such a big hit, in fact, that even Google has got in on the action.
Getting a Google interactive Easter egg on your search is like having the popular kid in school come to your party - it's a sign that you are in the big leagues - and Splatoon is now most certainly part of that crew.

Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque's challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month's Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I'm sorry to say that's about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

NieR: Automata coming to Switch is kind of a big deal, as the series continues to slowly expand platforms over the course of five years. It started on PS4, then went to PC, then Xbox One, and now Switch.

Y’see, Biotech introduces pregnancy, child-rearing, and families. It isn’t stopping there, because there’s also genetic engineering now. Your character will be able to psychically command semi-living machines too thanks to a special implant, making them your thralls. That’s one word for it, anyway.

The two week drought is broken with a shower of Electronic Wireless Show podcast rain, were we discuss the best villainous breakdowns we've enjoyed in video games. Matthew is sadly away this week because, while my coronavirus dose is mild, like the tingle of delicious Rio Tropical on your tongue, Matthew's is wild and aggressive, like a super-charged Electricity Cop.
In his absence, Nate and I talk about some proper good villains, and even discuss some sensible things like evil cartoon monsters vs. villains you can sort of sympathise with. Handsome Jack? GLaDOS? LeChuck? Andrew Ryan? That's one hell of an awkward dinner party. Plus stick around for a Cavern Of Lies that proves Warhammer 40k is essentially the same as Tumblr.

Aside from providing photo opportunities, setting up a picnic lets you clean your Pokémon and improve their stats with the power of sandwiches - because of course it does.

        <id>119318</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/10/06/need-for-speed-unbound-officially-revealed-out-this-december-on-new-gen-consoles-and-pc"/>
        <updated>2022-10-06T14:06:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it's quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pedal to the Metal
Following on from several months of leaks and rumors, Electronic Arts has finally lifted the curtain on the next entry in its long-running racing game series Need for Speed — As whispered by industry insiders, the new entry is titled Need for Speed Unbound, and will launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X on December 2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Y8XCe7F9E
As you can see from the stylish trailer above, soundtracked by the dulcet tones of A$AP Rocky, NFS Unbound will see a return to the competitive and combative street racing vibes of previous franchise entries such as the excellent Need for Speed Underground. NFS Unbound will follow the escapades of a die-hard, passionate gang of street racers, as they battle their way through the neon streets of the city, the ever-present wail of police sirens floating listlessly in the night skies.
As is to be expected, NFS Unbound will feature state-of-the-art visuals and game mechanics, and will also place a heavy emphasis on player customization, allowing the community to modify and decorate their ride so it will spin as many heads as it will wheels — in keeping with the new game flashy fashionista aesthetic. Developed by racing genre veterans Criterion Games, it is a fairly safe bet that NFS Unbound will deliver when it finally pulls out of the garage this winter.
Need for Speed Unbound launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X on December 2.

An Overwatch 2 SMS requirement became a hot topic in the last week or so, after it was revealed so close to launch: but that's no longer going to be a thing for a subset of players.
Taking to the official Blizzard forums to talk about the launch, the subject of SMS Protect came up. In short, Blizzard has "made the decision to remove phone number requirements for a majority of existing Overwatch players," with a fix expected to roll out on October 7. This entails a lack of a requirement for "any Overwatch player with a connected Battle.net account, which includes all players who have played since June 9, 2021."

As spotted by @PLDHnet over on Twitter, we get a peek at three new species of Pokémon (and a Rookidee, bless it), including what looks like a weird little mushroom / house, an all-white mouse thingy, and a green parakeet.

Farigiraf is a Normal / Psychic Pokémon whose head and tail effectively fuse together to become one - very bizarre! Nevertheless, its head is now fully equipped for both offensive and defensive capabilities, which will come in handy for its 'Cud Chew' and 'Armor Tail' abilities.

Promising something dedicated fans will enjoy, the new Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer is a big one, clocking in at 14 minutes. The video dump today mostly focuses on storylines centered around the three core overarching narratives of the game.
For one of the first times ever, we're getting a clear look at actual gameplay, including battle menus that aren't by way of a few seconds of fleeting footage. We get to see one of the starting loadouts for Quaxly (water gun, work up, wing attack, aqua jet), as well as the terrastallize ability, which is linked the R button.
Moving through the Scarlet and Violet trailer, we also get a walkthrough of mysterious Pokemon that shine (and are visible in the overworld), which can terrastalize after engaging them, and ch…]]></summary>

As you cross the land in search of revenge, you build a hand of cards representing resources and events, which you use to resolve situations—often with strange and surprising results. What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn't just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. 
On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game's SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a "unique" phone number for authentication purposes. The only problem is that pre-paid phones, which make up not just the boxed phones in stores like Walmart but m…]]></summary>

Indie outfit DreadXP, in association with AMC Networks and Cartel Entertainment, has announced that it has begun the development of a brand new video game based on the iconic horror anthology series Creepshow. Platforms or a release window were not announced.
The new game has been inspired by the TV series currently airing on horror network Shudder, which is itself styled after a trilogy of comically dark movies written and produced by author Stephen King and late director George A. Romero. While horror anthology films have been released in abundance over the past 50 years, the original Creepshow (1982) is still considered perhaps one of the genre's finest examples — even if the sequels are the very epitome of the law of diminishing returns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Press F for a Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare sequel
Considering the series has been around for a few decades at this point, Call of Duty has had to reinvent itself over and over to keep bringing players fresh concepts. The games have covered concepts from the first World War all the way to futuristic space combat, and some were received better than others, to say the least. Now that the series has started cycling back through classic CoD eras like World War II and the modern day, I guess I should have realized that the franchise would be returning to some of their other, less beloved concepts too.
As of a report from known (and often right) Call of Duty leaker Ralph Valve, Sledgehammer's upcoming 2025 CoD title will be a sequel to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which was originally released back in 2014. Valve also reports that Sledgehammer's next game was supposed to be a follow-up to the World War II-themed Vanguard, which didn't end up selling enough copies to warrant a sequel in its wake.
Advanced Warfare is certainly well-known, although a lot of that has to do with the now infamous "press F to pay respects" sequence. The gameplay allowed for increased mobility in gameplay thanks to the introduction of Exoskeleton armor, and fans seemed to like it enough before the series went fully futuristic with the near universally-disliked Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare that came out in 2016.
Although I have three different CoD titles under my belt now, I'm still getting to know the series, especially when it comes to the games with modern or futuristic settings. I guess if Valve's report is correct, then it's worth me going back to play some of the old games just to get a sense. From what I hear, though, I will definitely be steering clear of Call of Duty: Ghosts.

The news of Google Stadia's closure had an immediate effect on several developers. But it looks like Tequila Works and its horror game Gylt will be lasting beyond Stadia's closure.
Gylt was first released in November 2019 as a Google Stadia exclusive. In a new blog on the studio's website, the team confirms that Gylt will be heading to new platforms.
"Spooky season is around the corner... And we bring terrific news!" reads the quick update. "We've been working on it for a long time and it's finally time to make it official: Gylt is going multiplatform in 2023!"
No details about which platforms that entails have been released yet. Tequila Works suggest staying tuned to its social media channels for updates and news.

A Gylt trip
This is great news for Tequila Works fans who never got around to this particular project. The makers of Rime and The Sexy Brutale make some really cool-looking games, but Gylt was one of the notable exclusives Google nabbed for Stadia.
At least in this case, Gylt will not be riding off into the night. Hopefully we get some news soon about what platforms it will be coming to next year.
Meanwhile, other developers are trying to figure out their own solutions to Stadia's closure. Google announced the service is going down last week, confirming that it plans to refund users as well. The cloud streaming service for playing games launched in 2019, and has since seen competition rise from sources like Microsoft's xCloud.
The announcement came as a shock to some developers, who were still planning to bring games to the platform. Companies like Ubisoft, Bungie, and IO Interactive have all confirmed they're looking into methods of helping players who want to keep playing their games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone relates with a sad trombone
A couple of times a year, a "Phenomenon Game" pops up out of nowhere and is suddenly the talk of the town. Trombone Champ fits that description. It became a viral meme seemingly overnight, but this genius comedy game didn't come from nowhere. The people who made Trombone Champ had to stick with it for three difficult years, working only on nights and weekends, to put it all together.
The game was created by industry veterans Dan and Jackie Vecchitto. They've been self-publishing games for about a decade, and most of their projects have been free. Trombone Champ is actually the first title they've ever sold on Steam, so you can imagine their surprise when it went on to sell 20,000+ copies in its launch window, prompting NBC, The New York Times, and the CBC to all come calling for interviews.

Much to my surprise, they were also willing to talk to me for my Talking to Women about Videogames podcast (also on iTunes and Spotify). It's a small-time show by NBC standards, but since they had an OK time on Sup, Holmes (an interview live stream show for game devs I used to do), I guess they didn't mind coming back for another talk eight years later. I've been rooting for these two ever since then, long before I knew they were the people who made Trombone Champ, and it's been so great to see those roots grow into a tree made of trombones, thousands of dollars, and mainstream media attention.
We got into all that plus the couple's love of Star Trek, D&D, gnomes, my theories on the autobiographical nature of their gameography, and a lot more. Thanks again to Dan and Jackie for taking the time, and doing it on video to boot. It was (ahem) a "hoot."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready to battle some bosses
Dead Cells is widely regarded as one of the best roguelike games out there, and one of the best indie games of the past decade. It's one of those games you can play over and over again -- literally -- but for fans who are itching for something new, well, the Dead Cells dev team has you covered. The studio behind the game, Motion Twin, along with their subsidiary studio Evil Empire, announced an all-new Boss Rush mode as an add-on for the PC version of Dead Cells.
The idea is that players will have four unique stages to play through, and each stage has the player going up against bosses from the game back-to-back. The breakdown of stages goes like this: stage one has three bosses, stage two has five bosses, stage three has three enhanced bosses, and stage four has five enhanced bosses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCaZwowMm78
The enhanced bosses are new for the Boss Rush mode, and as you might expect, they have ways to make their already-intense battles even harder, like healing powers or allies that come and join them in the fight. If you've played through some of the harder heats in Hades, think of the enhanced boss stages like runs where you're only fighting Extreme Measures bosses.
Each stage also features Dead Cells bosses randomly selected from Tiers 1, 2, or 3, to which they are assigned based on how difficult they are -- so at least you won't be fighting The Queen five times in a row. The Boss Rush mode is accessible in-game through a door in the basement of the Prisoners' Quarters. Players will also win some serious loot as they defeat the different stages, with the type of prizes scaling depending on how many bosses they fight, which bosses they fight, and so on.
The Boss Rush mode is available now in Dead Cells for PC players, and will be coming to consoles later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crucial X6 is one of the best portable SSDs on the market, and a ginormous 2TB model is currently discounted to £129 at Amazon, from its normal price of £150. This makes it the cheapest 2TB portable SSD by a significant margin, with alternatives like the Samsung T7 and SanDisk Extreme 2TB costing £191 or more - and an excellent value for a drive of this calibre.

Valve is hosting the October Steam Next Fest right now, full of demos, livestreams, and more about games coming to the Steam platform.
There are actually hundreds of free, playable game demos on the platform right now from October 3 through 10. It's a great time for developers to show off what they've been working on, put more eyes on their Steam store pages, and accrue some coveted Wishlist additions.
With so many demos available, though, it can be a bit daunting to find exactly what you might like. Or to stumble upon something you didn't expect. That's where round-ups like these come in.
While by no means comprehensive, I've been spending the last few days digging through the lineup, playing demos, and adding them to my to-play list. Some of these gam…]]></summary>

As announced on Twitter, there will be several Nintendo concerts going on this month: specifically kicking off on October 10 at 11:00 CEST (5AM ET).
While details are slim, we do know that the digital concerts will feature the DJ K.K. [Slider] Animal Crossing: New Horizons Paradise Mix and Splatoon 3 Deep Cut performances. Based on the YouTube description, the concert is scheduled to go on for roughly one hour. To be clear, Nintendo has clarified that "both performances will be in Japanese without localized subtitles." You may recall that Nintendo has done various forms of K.K. Slider and Splatoon idol performances in the past, so this is mainly continuing that trend.
It's good to see Animal Crossing back in the fold in some form, as the great rush of billions of amiibo figures/cards seems to be at an end, alongside of major New Horizons updates. Splatoon 3 of course just came out, and alongside of regular free updates and Splatfests, will have a nice little footprint going into the holiday season.
It's also a nice way to see the newest Splatoon trio in action, given how popular the past characters have been!

Killer Queen Black launched back in 2019, and it's been a staple of my household ever since. The extremely unconventional team-versus-team game involved 5v5 battles to the death, with multiple ways to win each match. It encouraged a heavy dollop of team communication and tactical nuance in a way most games couldn't touch. But the era of playing it at home online is coming to an end on November 30, 2022.
Thankfully, Liquid Bit CEO Matt Tesch has fully explained the situation in a new blog, which they say is out of their hands. The crux of the problem is Amazon GameSparks, which essentially hosted the backend of Killer Queen Black. Amazon shut it down on September 30, but the team was able to get an "extension," through November 30, partially to finish out …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new voice for the Umbra Witch
The next entry in the Bayonetta series arrives this month. But the voice actor of the series' protagonist won't be returning for Bayonetta 3.
In an interview with Game Informer for its cover story on Bayonetta 3, Platinum Games confirms that Hellena Taylor, the voice actress of Bayonetta in the first two games, is not returning for the third.
Fans had speculated this may be the case, but now Platinum has made it clear. Rather than Taylor, Bayonetta will be voiced by popular voice actor Jennifer Hale.
"Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role," said game director Yusuke Miyata to Game Informer. "We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom we felt was a good match for the character. I understand the concerns some fans have about the voice change at this point in the series, but Jennifer's performance was way beyond what we could have imagined. I'm confident that her portrayal of Bayonetta will exceed our fans' expectations."
Bayonetta's voice actor for the Japanese VO will still be Atsuko Tanaka.

A new voice in the fray
Jennifer Hale is well-known for her work on several different game franchises, ranging from Rivet in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Ashe in Overwatch to perhaps her most well-known role as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy. There's little question that Platinum got someone talented to fill the shoes (gun-heels?) of Bayonetta.
Whether Hale fits as well as Taylor did for Bayonetta or not is the question. GI's coverage seems positive on the change, commending Hale's portrayal as being "sometimes indistinguishable" from Taylor's work in the first two games. But if you want to find out yourself, you'll have to wait until later this month.
Bayonetta 3 goes live for Nintendo Switch on October 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Killer Instinct's ranked mode has, for some time now, been the target of one individual, who has been rendering the leaderboards an absolute mess with a flurry of fake accounts, which they have used to essentially "jam" the online rankings for the dedicated KI community.

As you may recall, Capcom has a grand plan for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak post-launch support, which involves a roadmap with both pointed details and teasers. We got a major free title update in August, then another one in late September. Now, Capcom has confirmed that free title update 3, the next huge Monster Hunter Rise update, is coming in late November.
While it was previously slated for "winter 2022," it's now a sure thing for next month, and currently the plans include variant monsters (previously billed as "special species monsters"), as well as powered-up monsters. Capcom teases that more will be revealed in the coming weeks, and there's still "free title updates" slated for 2023. We're still unsure on the scope of what 2023 will bring, but so far the free title updates have injected more life into the game: which technically began with the launch of Rise in March of 2021.
Typically, on Switch, these patches will run around 0.6GB-1GB in size, and will add all sorts of quality of life features (including new guild card pages or awards), and bug fixes. While I'm not playing as much Rise currently with other stuff on my plate, it's nice to know that I won't miss anything diving back in, and these free updates will be waiting.

Sony Interactive Entertainment and Disney have announced that the shiny PS5 platform now has its own native Disney+ app available for download. This will allow users on the platform to access the Disney streaming service on their console in magnificent 4K HDR resolutions.
"A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we're excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users," notes EVP of product and design for Disney, Jerrell Jimerson in comments to The Verge. "The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans."
With the arrival of the Disney+ app, subscribers will now have access to an enormous archive of film, TV, and animated content from The House of Mouse. This includes films and shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe — such as recent Chud-aggravator She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, as well as thousands of hours of classic FOX programming such as the good episodes of The Simpsons and nothing else. Of course, you can also check out Disney's legendary catalog of classic animated movies, all starring wicked queens that I fancy.
Now that the PlayStation 5 platform offers access to Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, HBO Max, as well as an abundance of rad video games via the PlayStation Plus service, you basically don't have to leave the couch ever again. Better get started this weekend, however, I'm pretty sure none of us have the time necessary to watch every single episode of every single Star Wars show before we shuffle on.
And I still gotta find space and time for the celluloid excellence that is Hocus Pocus 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.]]></summary>

Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is getting an upgrade for newer console hardware. Both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S console versions of Kakarot are on the way with some shiny new graphics options.
These versions will launch on January 13, 2023, right near the start of the new year. For those who already have Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, Bandai Namco Entertainment will have a free upgrade path. Physical versions of the newer generation title will also be in the works.
As for the features, faster loading times and fluid gameplay up to 60 FPS are what Bandai Namco's got in store. There are also new visual details. The in-game card game Card Warriors will also be available as an offline version, for solo play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAW8DAEJWp0
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot will be available as just the standalone Standard Edition, or with the Deluxe or Legendary Edition, which include some of the post-launch DLC for Kakarot. Deluxe buyers get the first Season Pass, while Legendary buyers get the first and second Season Pass.
Rock the dragon
This action-RPG-ish take on Goku's journey will be just about two years old when the newer generation versions hit, and it's received a fair bit of support. As mentioned before, there are two Season Passes worth of content, plus more DLC that apparently features Goku's dad Bardock on the way.
But if 2D fighting games are more your Dragon Ball flavor, there's still some good news on the way. It was confirmed at Evo 2022 that Dragon Ball FighterZ will be getting PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, with rollback netcode on the way too. It seems like a pretty good time if you're a Dragon Ball fan with a new console, eager to see how the new hardware can render all those Gokus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live service titles are an exception
PlayStation Studios' head Hermen Hulst has noted that he expects future PlayStation titles to enjoy at least a year's exclusivity on home console platforms before making the jump to PC — The former Guerrilla Games managing director made the comments in an interview with journalist Julien Chieze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXSyAfNuvg8&t=432s
"I think, going forward, we’ll see at least a year between releases on PlayStation and on the PC platform, possibly with the exception of live service games," said Hulst when asked about the recent range of PC ports. "Live service games are a little bit different in nature because you want to have a strong community, strong engagement right away, right when you go live. So we might, in the case of our live service offerings, go day and date with PC and the PlayStation platform."
The Steam community has recently enjoyed a wide variety of previously considered PlayStation exclusives, including stellar releases such as God of War; Marvel's Spider-Man and its follow-up Miles Morales; Horizon Zero Dawn; as well as games from Naughty Dog's best-selling Uncharted franchise. Rumors also abound that Housemarque's PS5 sci-fi smash, Returnal, is also en route to the Steam platform.
Given Hulst's comments, it seems that PlayStation continues in its commitment to bringing its best-sellers to the PC audience but, understandably, wishes to give its loyal PS4/PS5 community priority. So while Steam fans will have to sit on their hands a little, they can be sure their patience will pay off.

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…]]></summary>

Microsoft has just unveiled their Xbox Game Pass October offerings, and so far it's looking good, especially when it comes to variety. I mean, it's pretty much on point every month in that regard, but genre-wise, there's a good spread.
One highlight includes Telltale's Walking Dead, which is launching both Season 1 and Season 2 on October 6. This is some of Telltale's earliest work, before they took on way too many projects and imploded. Chivalry 2 isn't a bad get either, and you can throw in the quirky Costume Quest for good measure.
Bigger Xbox Game Pass releases include Plague Tale: Requiem and Scorn later this month, which are day-and-date brand new launches with Game Pass. Both of those include cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S platforms. We're not losing a lot this month either! It should be a fun little time to sail into the winter season with a ton of games to play.
You can find the full schedule with exact dates below for both the additions and departures.

Xbox Game Pass October schedule:
Week of October 3:
Chivalry 2, October 4 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Medieval Dynasty, October 6 (Xbox Series X|S)

The Walking Dead: Season Two, October 6 (PC)
Week of October 10:
Costume Quest, October 11 (Cloud and Console)
Eville, October 11 (Console and PC)
Dyson Sphere Program, October 13 (PC)
Scorn, October 14 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S)
Week of October 17:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we're just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today's news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ's most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what's to come in the game's second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it's a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

Similar to Capcom's Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay.

Newcomer developer Stubby Games and publisher Playstack revealed The Entropy Centre during the Future Games Showcase in June, and it immediately caught my attention. On the one hand, it seemed to wear its Portal-inspiration on its sleeve, an immediate draw for me. On the other hand, its concept as a puzzle game sounded new and unique: use a weapon that turns back time on individual objects aboard a space station to stop the Earth from exploding.
I continued to cover the game and its various trailer drops, excited to finally go hands-on with it, wondering if it’d live up…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn't a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.
Whether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond "perfectly enjoyable" into "thrilling", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man's Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again.

Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-10-04T18:14:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your host Wesley LeBlanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Nier Automata: The End of YoRHa Edition, a new version of the game exclusive to Switch. The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. 
While Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:
Nier Automata base game
All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you're wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you're wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.
Garbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…]]></summary>

Platinum Games’ long-awaited threequel doesn’t rest on the laurels of its beloved predecessors. Gaming’s favorite witch has new tricks up her sleeves in the forms of Demon Masquerade and Demon Slave, letting players utilize their demonic minions in combat in new, kaiju-sized ways. If one Bayonetta wasn’t enough, a multiversal storyline introduces several variants that bring their unique brands of flair. At the center of this crisis stands newcomer Viola, the second playable character and rookie Umbra Witch, who serves as a mysterious key to the game’s events.

This news comes by way of the studio's investor call today, in which the studio revealed Orion, the codename for its next Cyberpunk game. Not much else was revealed, but CDPR says Orion "will take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark future universe." 
Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says "it is the beginning of a new saga" and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don't get too excited just yet – this first look isn't a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

October 4, 2022
Here's a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film's first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is "unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world". After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won't have an Italian accent in the film. 
What do you think Chris Pratt's Mario will sound like? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

This is what I experienced with Flat Eye, a story-heavy management sim where you're in charge of a super-advanced gas station, where you harvest personal data from the port-a-loos, and feed the biological matter from those same toilets into your high-tech vending machine. Mmmmm. Flat Eye, the Next Fest demo for which you can download and play right now, is from Night Call devs Monkey Moon. I liked Night Call fine, but I really love the Flat Eye demo.

It’s spawned more movies, spin-offs, and comics than I can count, and has easily cemented itself in mainstream pop culture as “those zombie games with dogs.” But not all Resident Evil games are amazing.

        <updated>2022-10-04T12:34:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation's investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, "further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. 
"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities," he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix's Witcher series, and Bloober Team's own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
"Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together," Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. "The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions." 
As noted in Babieno's writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony's God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.
FIFA has focused on one facet of soccer for years: the attack. It’s almost arc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The WD SN550 is going cheap at Ebuyer's Ebay UK page right now, with a 2TB drive costing just £118.98. That's an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That's about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you'll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

This premiere is being dubbed as the "first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced.

Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the "Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn't it?" category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.

Yesterday, the official Steam Deck Twitter account shared a list of the most played games on the handheld PC gaming machine in September. The list includes Vampire Survivors, Elden Ring, Stardew Valley, Cyberpunk 2077, Hades and No Man's Sky.

        <updated>2022-09-30T21:12:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.
"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture," he said in a press release. "I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it."
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.]]></summary>

As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they're all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It's certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It's not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google's own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out Of Hands is a fairly "does what it says on the tin" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill "a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this year's Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio's Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.

        <updated>2022-09-30T10:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. "He’s the person behind the worst of the twists," creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. "He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few."

Foxhole is one of the few to do it successfully: a single, massive World War 2 battlefield in which players don't just fight at the frontlines, but form supply routes, build defenses, and otherwise take the reigns of the logistics of war. After five years in early access, Foxhole released version 1.0 today.

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds "for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store," according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you "will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date." 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says "most hardware purchases...made directly from Google" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Kepler Interactive and developer Ebb Software have revealed that Scorn's release date has changed, moving up one week earlier in October. The game will now release on October 14 instead of the previously announced October 21. 
As for why, the team doesn't say. However, a new teaser trailer released today is titled, "You've waited long enough," so perhaps the studio simply wants to get this game into players' hands sooner. Check it out for yourself below: 


Here are some screenshots from the game:

Having spent much of my early thirties skulking around the Barbican, I really enjoyed this variety of Brutalist experiences. And the monstermurder. The monstermurder's fun, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. 
Here's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again.

Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

We've included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month's Time Capsule, but there's another notable exception we've decided to save for further down the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a definition of "pure" that's proscriptive; a dogmatic adherence to surface details and strict rituals. I'm genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many 'retro' inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S.

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid. In it, Blizzard says a consistent piece of feedback it has received is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch's hero pool and various modes. As such, the team has implemented a new First Time User Experience, or FTUE, designed for Overwatch 2 players who have never played Overwatch. 
The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game's modes and chat functions – this happens "rapidly," Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing "approximately 100 matches," a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s usually nice to see older games get updates, particularly when we’re not expecting it. Think of it as a good jump scare. Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, "ooo yes, very nice" and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, "oh, why do you exist?" There's also a rare third class of Pokémon I call "weird lil things" when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class' newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it's just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: 


I'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. 
Is Wiglett going to be in your party? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below!]]></summary>

I'd even go so far as to say it might be the perfect side entrance into the Yakuza series as a whole.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review"/>
        <updated>2022-09-28T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

Players who complete the 80-tier premium Battle Pass receive Cyber Demon Genji, the first of Overwatch's new class of customizable cosmetics called Mythic Skins. 
We recently interviewed Overwatch 2's leadership group to learn about their philosophy while developing the Battle Pass and Mythic Skins' role in the sequel's revamped monetization …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester's impressions of that title here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a "world class event to serve the global gaming industry." The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.]]></summary>
