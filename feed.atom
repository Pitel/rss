        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. 
RPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?

Much like its immediate predecessor, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is seemingly crammed full of glitches; if you know how to trigger them, that is. The latest lets you view the world via a first-person perspective at any given moment.
As discovered by Gaming Reinvented, the glitch is admittedly a bit of a faff to pull off, so we're not going to list out every step required here, but be sure to watch the video carefully if you'd like to try it out yourself. Needless to say, you'll need to get started with the 'Hold Storage' glitch, so if you're already familiar with this, then you're on the right track.

The Gold Master Series officially started with The Making of Karateka, but the format was first piloted for Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. Rather than just being collections, the titles are interactive documentaries built around the games they contain. In this way, greater context and, therefore, a greater appreciation can be formed for the subjects.




Jeff Minter is a veteran of game design. He began his career in the early 1980’s, developing games for 8-bit microcomputers like the Sinclair ZX81 and the Commodore Vic-20. A lot of his early games were clones of popular arcade titles, which w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what is an odd and pretty funny surprise, Vampire Survivors is getting an Among Us-themed DLC. Titled Emergency Meeting, the DLC sees the survivors teaming up with the Among Us crewmates and fighting alien hordes.


While Among Us is no stranger to crossovers, especially with other indie titles, Emergency Meeting marks Vampire Survivors' first crossover DLC. It's expansive too, adding eight playable characters, 15 weapons, and a new stage called Polus Replica.


As with the base game and other paid DLCs, Emergency Meeting is pretty affordable at $2.50. Fans won't have to wait long to play it either as it comes out on December 18 for PC and Xbox Series consoles. 




Alongside the blog post announcing the DLC, a trailer went live on poncle's YouTube page. It's pretty amazing, as several Vampire Survivors characters are transported to space and meet the Among Us cast. What ensures is a team-up to fend off thousands of angry aliens with planet-destroying powers.


It only slightly exaggerates the gameplay loop in Vampire Survivors, but it exemplifies the power trip that begins when equipped with all possible upgrades in a run. Honestly, I would have been happy with the crossover being just the trailer. An entire DLC paired with it is just the icing on the cake.


As unexpected as this crossover is, it looks like an absolute blast. This alongside patch 1.8 adding the narrative-based Adventures mode means Vampire Survivors fans are getting a significant amount of new content to chew through.

A new report from IGN's Rebekah Valentine alleges that the situation only worsens for the remaining employees at Bungie. Morale and company culture seem like they're taking a backseat, in order to avoid something as drastic as a complete Sony takeover.


Following Bungie's layoffs at the end of October, reports surfaced that the studio was drastically missing revenue targets. A Bloomberg report claimed the company would delay Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion in addition to the upcoming new title Marathon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Wholesome Snack Showcase, Happy Broccoli Games has revealed their investigative adventure, Duck Detective: The Secret Salami. It will be coming to PC sometime in 2024.


Happy Broccoli Games has stated that Duck Detective: The Secret Salami is a 90-minute detective game, and that sounds perfect. It’s inspired by Return to the Obra Dinn and The Case of the Golden Idol, and has you, the eponymous duck, gathering clues, interviewing suspects, and putting the pieces together to find out who did the crime. What crime? Something to do with sausages. 




That’s about all we’re told. It takes place in an office, so I assume someone ate their co-worker’s lunch. I cannot imagine ever doing that. I can’t imagine the kind of person who would. And yet, it happens. That’s so weird and maliciously inconsiderate. Who raised these people?


I like the sudden surge of detective games in the indie and alternative markets. It has gotten to the point where I can’t keep up with them, but most of the ones I’ve played have been really enjoyable. They make me feel smart, even if I’m just painting by numbers.


I also like seeing a game advertise its short length. Often, we get too caught up on time spent per dollar, but I don’t want to live in a world where every game is 60 hours. Some of them? Yes. But not all. I’d like to pick one up for afternoon entertainment. Such as Dangeresque The Roomisode Triungulate, which is also roughly 90 minutes. It’s great! There's no reason for me to not play this game. Even if I don't enjoy it, what have I lost? I spend more time a day killing my brain with Social Media.


Duck Detective: The Secret Salami is set to arrive on PC sometime in 2024.

        <updated>2023-12-06T20:09:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've had enough of the rough and tumble adventure of Eastward, it's time to take a step back with the upcoming Octopia DLC. This one trades in a collapsing society for one full of fruitful farming fun, and developer Pixpil and publisher Chucklefish have it lined up for a January 31, 2024 launch. 


To shake the tribulation of Eastward, Pixpil set Octopia in a parallel world that is, to say the least, a lot more chill. This time around Sam and John get to bask in that sweet farming life in the countryside as they build up an old farmstead, grow crops, cook with neighbors, and attract more eager new folks to the town of Octopia. 


You can settle in yourself with the release date trailer:




The meticulous pixel art for which Eastward is known is one bond that this world and the other have in common. While Octopia is being released as DLC for Eastward, you don't have to complete the game to gain access. As long as you have a copy of Eastward you'll be able to venture to Octopia right from the main menu. Sam and John's peaceful new life will be available on Nintendo Switch and Steam for $5.99.


Eastward first launched in September 2021, delivering a journey adorned with gorgeous art and a soundtrack we won't soon forget. There's plenty of competition out there for farming sim games with nostalgic vibes, so we'll see how this one fits in early next year.

        <updated>2023-12-06T19:46:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open Roads, the narrative adventure game starring Keri Russell (The Americans, Star Wars Episode IX: Rise of Skywalker) and Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End), finally has a release date, nearly three years after its initial reveal at The Game Awards 2020. It hits consoles and PC on February 22, 2024. 
Publisher Annapurna Interactive announced this release date today with a new trailer that features Russell talking about the game. Check out the Open Roads release date trailer for yourself below: 


A likely reason Open Roads took three years to reveal a release date after its 2020 debut is because its original creative lead, Steve Gaynor, co-founder of Fullbright and director of Gone Home, was accused of cultivating a hostile work environment in 2021, as reported by Polygon. Shortly after the allegations arose, Gaynor stepped back from his role as creative lead and manager. Since then, Open Roads has detached itself from Fullbright, with the small team of developers behind the title going by Open Roads Team.  
Game Informer spoke to the Open Roads Team in 2022 about these changes and how it was moving forward with the game's development – you can read our in-depth feature about it here. 
"In Open Roads, Tess [Devers] and Opal [Russell] embark on a road trip adventure to explore a series of long-abandoned properties, unearthing the past," the game's description reads on Steam. "They'll search the ruins of these places that hold buried memories, things Opal has tried for years to forget. And in this search, they'll discover not just the truth they've been seeking, but each other." 
Open Roads hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Febraury 22, 2024.

It runs over two-and-a-half minutes long and provides a pretty good idea of what Epic Games is trying to accomplish with the new game mode. It seems less like another battle royale, and more like a Minecraft-inspired world building game. 




The trailer follows the Brite Bomber character, one of over 1,200 Fortnite skins that are getting a Lego makeover. As we see her traverse this new Lego-themed land, we get a general idea of what Epic Games and Lego are collaborating on to create.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may think you're done with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, but Team Ninja isn't done with you just yet. Koei Tecmo revealed a date for the third piece of DLC, titled Upheaval in Jingxiang, which touches down on December 12, 2023.


If you're looking for new challenges, there should be plenty to go around in Jingxiang. Chief among the additions is a new story chapter that finds Liu Bei's forces fighting back against the chaos the Elixir has caused. As it continues to wreak havoc throughout the land following the death of Yu Ji, you'll be tasked with traveling to the Jing Province to put an end to its grim effects. 


Get a taste of the story in the DLC 3 trailer:




Upheaval in Jingxiang also adds new enemies and demons, a new Divine Beast, and new generals that include Guan Ping and Lady M, among others. That's on top of the new equipment and a new system — that's all the official site says on the latter — and higher difficulty levels for those who didn't find Wo Long tough enough already. Finally, there's a new weapon category in the Whip, which looks painful as all hell.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is currently available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you have Xbox Game Pass you can also check it out there. This has me hungry to get back to Wo Long, which I unfortunately fell off after clearing a dozen or so bosses. It turns out there are multiple dozens more beyond that, so I've got my work cut out for me.

In fact, it's just received a major new DLC; one that takes the Vault dwellers to the Jersey Shore, of all places. Enter Fallout 76: Atlantic City - Boardwalk Paradise.


It goes without saying that Bethesda didn't miss a beat in leveraging Atlantic City's emblematic entertainment options. Boardwalk Paradise is chock-full of gambling mini-games (unless you're from Belgium, Czech Republic, Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Libya, Pakistan, Poland, or Thailand, as per the YouTube listing) that may remind players of New Vegas' The Strip. The vibe of the Atlantic City follows the tried-and-true casino aesthetic that Fallout players are already familiar with, which is a grea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being one of the biggest streaming platforms in the world, Twitch has more than its share of problems. Recently, the company announced 180 employees were being laid off, and now it's having to cease operations in Korea.


In a recent blog post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has said the service will shut down business in Korea, effective February 27, 2024. The statement goes on to say that it was a "difficult decision" but the "the cost to operate" Twitch in the country is "prohibitively expensive."

Clancy explains that the company had spent time trying to reduce the cost of running in Korea, saying that the team "experimented with a peer-to-peer model for source quality." All efforts appear to be in vain, though, with the platform saying it's been "operating at a loss."


What happens to Korean streamers?


Obviously, this means that anyone in Korea who uses Twitch to broadcast won't be able to come the end of February. In the blog post, Clancy says streamers who "devoted significant time and effort into building their communities" will be helped.


The company will "work to help Twitch streamers in Korea move their communities to alternative livestreaming services." Sadly, those who are perhaps not on Twitch's radar will unlikely be given a hand.


Last month, it was also announced that Twitch was being dropped from the Nintendo Switch, owing to numerous and recurring issues with the app. The Amazon-owned service will no doubt continue to dominate the streaming market, but these avenues being closed off will no doubt be harmful for business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skyrim mods have always been a vital aspect in keeping the aging Elder Scrolls game alive and well. While the vast majority of them are free to download and install, Bethesda is once again interested in keeping some of the higher quality ones back for profit.


A recent update for Skyrim was sent out and with it, Bethesda announced Creations, a new way for "players to discover, download and play community-made content." In a nutshell, it means modders specially picked by the developer can earn a bit of money for their mods. That's right, you'll have to pay for these if you want to play them.




An FAQ explains those that have been vetted – referred to as "Verified Creators" – can set a price for mods "from a set selection of options." They will then receive royalties from their content. While anyone can apply to be entered into the "Verified Creator Program," it seems it's reserved mainly for those with experience and expertise, possibly bordering on professional levels.


Because it was so popular last time...


As you can imagine, it isn't going down well with the Skyrim community at all. Recent reviews on Steam show many are angry about this new "evolution," as Bethesda is calling it. Not only does it reintroduce paid community content, but some have said the update has broken some mods.


Something similar was attempted back in 2015, when Bethesda teamed up with Valve to implement a way of getting players to pay for custom mods. That didn't go down well then, either, so it's interesting that it's being tried again.


Whether this is something that's being attempted to see if it'll work with Starfield is just speculation on my part. It should be noted that modders can choose to upload content to Skyrim for free. But in any case, the Elder Scrolls and Fallout studio is once again making itself unpopular among the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Day of the Devs Digital Showcase, SFB Games, the developers behind Snipperclips and the upcoming Crow Country, has revealed that their 2019 detective hit Tangle Tower is getting a sequel called The Mermaid’s Tongue. It’s set to release on PC in 2024, but has a demo available today.


The Mermaid’s Tongue is once again a murder mystery that brings back the duo of Grimoire and Sally. It will once again be a mix of point-and-click adventure, visual novel, and puzzle game. This time, the victim is the “captain of the world’s strangest submarine.” I’m going to directly quote the press release on why it’s so strange: “Some say the captain was an immortal time-traveler. Others say he was a vampire, cursed to stay hidden beneath the waves forever.” Yeah, me too.




What’s been shown off so far is what you’d expect from a Tangle Tower sequel. Wonderfully animated characters and fabulous backgrounds. I could watch that animation all day.


I played the demo, which does a great job of setting up the mystery and getting you hooked in before it stops abruptly. When it ended, I audibly said, “You dick!” I mean, I didn’t expect a demo to contain the whole game. It was inevitably going to end mid-mystery, but it feels like an episode of Columbo showed the murder and cut out before the investigation. That's a me problem. I probably shouldn’t have played the demo, I guess.


The Mermaid’s Tongue has a planned release in 2024 on PC. The demo is available today.

Pixpil's gorgeous adventure game Eastward is getting farming DLC, and it's out on 31st January 2024 on Nintendo Switch. The date was revealed during the Wholesome Snack presentation, which followed Day of the Devs Game Awards showcase.
Eastward: Octopia was announced earlier this year and is set in a parallel world where Sam and John don't need to worry about the miasma that plagues the main game. So this is a much more relaxing experience than the base game! We also have to appreciate the cheeky little Animal Crossing in the YouTube description. "Population.... growing!?" We see you, Chucklefish.

As for the reason for these layoffs, League of Geeks co-founder Trent Kusters states: 



“Though our commitment to our beloved starship adventure sim is unwavering, rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor Early Access sales, and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry, have placed us in a position where, as it currently stands, we are unable to sustain the cost of operations through to the release of v1.0, which was planned for Q2 of 2024…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Wholesome Snack Showcase, Armor Games Studios and Bluecurse Studios announced that Snacko, the cat-fronted farming game, is set to enter Early Access… now. Right now! Go look!


Snacko is a farming sim much like Stardew Valley (and Harvest Moon before it). You grow crops, raise livestock, and help a town learn to love again. Also, you have to push back miasma born from a curse that has overtaken the town of Snacko. All the while being a cat.




I’m going to be honest with you: I actually knew this drop was going to happen ahead of time. I was only pretending to be surprised. I’m sorry for the betrayal. I also got to play it early and can tell you’re in for a cute time.


Aside from the visuals, one of Snacko’s big draws is the fact that you can seemingly build and customize anything. I think that includes the town, but I tried picking up somebody’s house, and it wouldn’t let me. It might just not let me do anything in town yet. I only really played enough to clear the tutorial.


It feels good so far, and its bright visuals with 2D characters look like a mix of a DS game and Mega Man Legends. The two-member developer states that they hope to have Snacko in Early Access for a year. In its current state, most of the game’s core systems are in place, and you can play the story from start to finish. From the sounds of things, Early Access is mostly going to be about getting feedback to help fix and polish its various elements.


Snacko is available on PC via Steam Early Access. It will also be coming to Switch, PS4, and PS5 in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, this is a lovely surprise, isn't it? Chill letter writing game Kind Words was a lofi hit back in 2019, encouraging players to share over 5 million anonymous notes of support and, well, kindness since launch. Now developers Popcannibal are back with a full-blown sequel, Kind Words 2 (Lofi City Pop). You're probably thinking, 'How could they possibly have made a sequel to this perfectly formed note 'em up? Have they added emails? Carrier pigeons? Inscribing on stone tablets?' Well, as the reveal trailer below shows, it's gone for more of an Animal Crossing-style city to enjoy, letting you connect with fellow players and express your deepest feelings in new, more directed settings. That's right, it's time to get out of your bedroom and touch some virtual grass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pour one out for Mimimi Games today, readers. Despite announcing they were shutting up shop following the release of this year's fantastic Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, today marks the grand finale for their stealth strategy masterpiece in the form of a new free Treasure Hunt update, and the release of their two paid expansions. Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. 
Mimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio. Naturally, spoilers circle these waters like hungry sharks, but if you're resigned to such a fate, let's dive in below.

As I mentioned in our RPS reacts piece, I'm genuinely excited by the prospect of a renewed Vice City and you bet I'll be there for the inevitable five-minute narrated trailer that begins with a person saying, "Welcome to Vice City".
There's no doubt Vice City is going to be dense and chaotic, going by all the twerking and the social media parodies of real life Florida folks. But really, I do hope that Rockstar doesn't just reserve next-gen's horsepower for wildness. I want some peace, some quiet, some innocuous suburbs to laze around in. That would be nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ultros is one of those games you can't help but pay attention to. Back when it was first revealed in May at Sony's pre-notE3 PlayStation Showcase, its colourful, fever dream visuals from Hotline Miami artist El Huervo instantly made it stand out among all the drab multiplayer shooters jostling for attention. Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time. This is surely going to be one to watch for Metroidvania likers when it comes out on February 13th next year, because cor, this is looking really quite good, folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside the launch of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 1, Epic Games revealed Lego Fortnite, a new experience that takes the familiarity of Fortnite and mashes it together with Lego for a new survival adventure experience. Today, Epic Games and Lego released a cinematic trailer for Lego Fortnite that reveals crafting, combat, multiplayer team-ups, a massive world to explore, and more. 
The trailer begins with a standard Fortnite character – Brite Bomber – running into a reality-shifting rift that transports her to a Lego-fied world. There are Lego sheep, castle-like structures, rolling hills and plains, and, unfortunately for this character, a storm. She runs into the castle to discover a crafting bench of sorts where she crafts an axe, and that's where her survival adventure begins.
Check out the Lego Fortnite cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, after crafting an axe, she creates a cabin for shelter, a pen for the Lego sheep, an entire garden, and a bonfire to cook some food. It's not long before banana character Peely (also Lego-fied) shows up, and after hearing the howls of some nearby wolves, the two craft some weapons. From here, the duo meets two others, and together, all four of them set off on a survival adventure that brings them over snowy mountains, into a desert, and eventually, into a cavernous mine where they run into deadly skeletons and a massive monster. 
The trailer's cinematics end there, cutting to a Lego Fortnite title screen that reveals the new experience goes live in Fortnite tomorrow, December 7. 
Lego Fortnite is just one of three new Fortnite experiences revealed alongside Chapter 5 of the Battle Royale mode. Also joining the Fortnite multiverse of experiences is Rocket Racing, a new racing mode, and Fortnite Festival, a new music-centric experience.

League of Geeks, the developer behind the acclaimed Switch game Armello, has announced that over 50% of its staff have been made redundant.
In total, 31 people have been laid off following "unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities" within the industry, along with rising operation costs and poor Early Access sales. As a result, plans for a full release of Jumplight Odyssey (which wasn't announced for Switch) have been put on hold due to the loss of the entire team. The release of Solium Infernum in the new year, however, has not been affected.

Yet no game is perfect. If there's one thing we can agree on, it's probably that. Even the very best of the best are likely to have something that doesn't look or feel quite right, yet these moments tend to get lost in the conversation when we talk about our favourite games, particularly when we're wearing a pair of comfortable nostalgia goggles.

Created by a former Hi-Rez subsidiary that includes several of the original Ascend leads, the new shooter retains its celebrated predecessor's emphasis on agility and momentum, but will be a premium game sold for $20 with separately sold cosmetics, rather than a free-to-play affair. It also won't have a singleplayer campaign, much to the probable consternation of Tribes: Vengeance fans, and the indifference of everybody else.

        <updated>2023-12-06T13:31:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 launched back in September and became one of our favorite games of the year – read why in Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review here. Since its release, developer NetherRealm Studios has released additional characters, like Invincible's Omni-Man, while teasing other new fighters like Quan Chi and DC's Peacemaker. Now, Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has teased even more new content on the way. 
During the recent CCXP23 event in Brazil, Boon revealed that story DLC is coming, as reported by IGN. 


"Just like we did with [Mortal Kombat 11], we're going to release a second part with more story and we have a big surprise after that," Boon told the crowd at CCXP23. 
Mentioning Mortal Kombat 11, it's likely that Boon was referring to its Aftermath DLC, which included an all-new story and more. After this story DLC release for Mortal Kombat 1, it sounds like players can expect even more in the form of a "big surprise." Unfortunately, Boon stopped short of sharing more about this surprise. 
This additional content speaks to the studio's philosophy around supporting Mortal Kombat 1 post-launch. Boon said during CCXP23 that, "[We're] going to be supporting the game for even longer than we did with Mortal Kombat 11," adding that, "It's going to be fun." 


If the recent cadence of content is any indication, Mortal Kombat 1 fans are in for a treat over the next few years with NetherRealm's latest fighter. 
For more, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review and then check out Boon on the YouTube interview show, Hot Ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future… I will finish my review of Owlcat’s Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Rockstar Games released the first official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI earlier this week and in 24 hours, it surpassed 100 million views while also nabbing the record for the most views in 24 hours. YouTuber Mr. Beast previously held that record before the GTA VI trailer. At the time of this writing, the trailer has 104 million views on YouTube. 
If you missed it, watch the Grand Theft Auto VI reveal trailer below: 


Rockstar celebrated the achievement yesterday with a quote-tweet of Mr. Beast's tweet revealing the "most views on YouTube in 24 hours" record now belongs to GTA VI. Check it out below: 
🙌❤️ https://t.co/x1eKOE0Qde
December 5, 2023
Elsewhere, Rockstar has spent the days since the GTA VI reveal celebrating the milestone by quote tweeting the likes of Lebron James, Tom Petty (whose song, "Love Is A Long Road" plays in the trailer), and more. It even posted the trailer natively to Twittter.
Grand Theft Auto VI is set to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2025. 
For more, watch the Grand Theft Auto VI reveal trailer, and then watch Game Informer's own two Florida Men analyze it to determine just how Florida it is. After that, read about how Grand Theft Auto VI won't be launching on PC on day one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!

The jungles and the plains might be wonderful to look at, but they're too vast, filled with boring tasks, and overly reliant on level-gating to force a sense of progress. Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, "the humans are bad", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.

While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora does indeed have some overlapping elements with the Far Cry series, it’s very much its own game. If anything, it takes those elements and pushes them further, while molding them to fit within the world of James Cameron’s Avatar.


For fans of Avatar in general, Frontiers of Pandora is just what you’re looking for. Even if you’re not, the beautiful world that Massive Entertainment has created mixed with its tight combat system pushes the staple open-world fun of Ubisoft to the ne…]]></summary>

The Avatar films are great fun but have never blown me away with original storytelling. Instead, the translation of familiar formulas into a vibrant and visually arresting alien world elevates the films. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora follows that same tack, featuring first-person exploration and combat that borrows liberally from franchises like Far Cry. But here, an enormous and detailed fantasy world breathes life into the experience, making it both more engaging and sometimes needlessly obtuse – but always with a flair for the source material.

The game, developed by Wayforward, features six playable heroes, and a new trailer runs down each one and what they bring to the table.


The trailer also provides another look at Operation Galuga’s modernized run-and-gun action, which harkens back to the classics with up to four players working together to blast apart enemies. Operation Galuga serves as a reimagining of the first Contra game with a roster of heroes bringing the fight to the Red Falcon terrorist faction, which Konami breaks down below:

It’s the perfect game to bring home and play with family during the holidays.


It’s a party game mixed with a dating sim, and the dating sim part is taken very seriously. The genre had exploded a few years earlier with 1994’s Tokimeki Memorial, and it was quickly adopted into other genres, such as trivia and puzzle games.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an efficiency monster. Min-maxing, goal-setting, and achievements — they’re all part of my milestone-driven playstyle in most games. My quest for powerful builds or ideal stats often adds a layer of challenge that games don’t demand, but I rarely deviate from the strategy. Coral Island makes optimization impossible though, and I think I love it.


Starting out


The only things I really knew about Coral Island were that it involved farming and had extensive romance options. I went in with a few specific goals: romance a certain villager, create a profitable farm, and beat the game. Get in, get out.


Right off the bat, I realized my to-do list wouldn’t be so easy. I needed to speak to the carpenter, but their store was closed for the night. Okay. I tried to visit the general store inst…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 received its Patch 5 update this week, adding a host of new features including the grueling endurance run called Honour Mode. Today, Larian Studios shared how many have cleared the challenge thus far, and it's quite humbling.


In a series of stat infographics, Larian shows that 464 parties have finished Baldur's Gate 3 Honour Mode. A number in the hundreds might seem large, but that's out of roughly 158,000 Honour Mode playthroughs that have kicked off thus far. And just as importantly, over 34,000 of those runs have already been brought to an end.




It seems like Honour Mode is living up to its goal of being an even-greater challenge for Baldur's Gate 3 players. Alongside enforcing a single save file and upping the general challenge of BG3, the mode adds an arsenal of L…]]></summary>

The live-action The Legend of Zelda movie is still a long way off, but the film's director — The Maze Runner and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes director Wes Ball — has finally shared his hopes and thoughts on the film.
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly (via Stealth on Twitter), Ball says that he wants his Zelda movie to feel like a "live-action Miyazaki" movie. Ball states that he's a big fan of the Legend of Zelda games and a fan of Hayao Miyazaki, the acclaimed animated director and co-founder of Studio Ghibli, whose films include Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and 2023's The Boy and the Heron.

Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, The Last of Us Part II is getting the big remaster treatment in January, over three years after it was released for PlayStation 4. This updated version leverages the PlayStation 5’s hardware with graphical bells and whistles like native 4K resolution, improved textures, and unlocked framerate. It also adds new interactive goodies, such as developer commentary and previously unplayable lost levels. But the centerpiece of the package’s new offerings is a new mode called No Return.

Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration was already a remarkably comprehensive package when it launched back in 2022, boasting over 100 games from Atari's history from its humble arcade beginnings to the ill-fated Jaguar console.
Seemingly not content to leave it as it is, however, developer Digital Eclipse has launched the first of several free updates, adding 12 games to the line-up comprised of official titles, unreleased prototypes, and homebrews. While the update is unlikely to convince anybody not already sold on the idea of playing games based largely on tech from the late '70s, the additions here are going to prove invaluable to fans who might have missed out on homebrew curios like Adventure II and Return to Haunted House.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With thousands already waiting for the trailer to drop, the GTA 6 teaser has been one of the most anticipated promos of this year, maybe of this whole generation. While it was unveiled a little earlier than planned, this has only made it possible for even more people to watch it many, many times.


At the time of writing, over 70 million people have seen the GTA 6 trailer over on YouTube. By comparison, "Baby Shark" has amassed around 13 billion views at the time of this writing, so GTA still has some way to go, but we're only on day one so far. Oh, also, the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer has been viewed 98 million times, so it sounds like the new one could easily surpass it.


This number of people watching the trailer is going up at a pretty alarming rate, which is not entirely unsurprising. By now, many of you will have seen it, so you'll have your own thoughts on the upcoming new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series.




Sadly, we don't have a release date. All we know is that it's coming in 2025. That still feels like a long way off, especially for a game that people have been waiting about a decade for.


Also, no PC release confirmed yet


Parent company Take-Two Interactive also confirmed that GTA 6 will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series. Nothing's been said about a PC version. If we're going off what happened with Grand Theft Auto 5, PC players might not get it for another year or so after the console release.


The teaser itself wasn't actually supposed to release when it did. Due to leaks on social media, Rockstar decided to show the trailer early.


GTA 6 has already been the subject of hacks and leaks, so the fact that someone was able to get the trailer up before the official release time is not that surprising. Still, it doesn't seem to have harmed the Rockstar YouTube figures much. It could very well go down as the most watched video game trailer in history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite version 2.0 supposedly being the last big update for Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red is bringing us one last hurrah. As well as implementing a number of fixes, the latest patch brings with it fresh ideas to see things out before the studio moves onto new games.


To go with the Ultimate Edition that's also been released, update 2.1 has added a few changes today. You can check out the video below for an overview. Some of the things now in Cyberpunk 2077 include a metro system, hangouts with partners, new vehicles, better vehicle combat, improved boss fights, and more.




You can also read the full patch notes to see what else has been done in this latest version. As you can see, it's no small feat, encompassing a veritable laundry list of tweaks, fixes, and changes. The update should be rolling out as we speak.


Is this it for Cyberpunk now?


CDPR recently said it's ramped up the team size for the new Witcher saga. On top of that, Community Director for the studio, Marcin Momot, has said that 2.1 represents "one more patch" for the game. After this, the team will be focusing on future projects, of which there are quite a few.




That's not to say Cyberpunk will be abandoned entirely. At least not for the immediate future. The game is about to turn three-years old, and CD Projekt Red will probably want to keep things ticking over for a bit longer. However, the developer is now thinking about what's coming next, which includes working on a sequel to Cyberpunk.


For now, we at least get one last crack at some new changes in Night City. Make your next playthrough count, as it's almost certainly the last major update the game will be getting. For real this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doom scrolling social media looks to have replaced the age-old pasttime of watching TV in GTA 6, which has prompted feelings of alternating despair and increasing irrelevance in me this morning. I barely understand how TikTok works in real-life, let alone a video game pastiche of it, and oh god, how did I get so old and craggy? I'm just here for the nice-looking flamingos, Rockstar, not a 24/7 twerk stream I can access from the palm of my hand. Of course, TV watching may yet have been preserved beyond what we've seen so far in the first trailer for GTA 6, but even if it's been consigned to the bin of modern history, there might yet be one light in the TikTok-esque darkness to make GTA 6's in-game social media network worthwhile. 
Upon closer inspection of the account names seen in the trailer, it's "PlanetLeonidaMan" that gives me hope, because if this isn't a riff on the Florida Man meme, I'll take a dump on a dead possum during rush hour traffic, hurl Oreos at Matthew as we argue over our empty coffee maker (teapot, come on), and try to cross the Atlantic in a hamster wheel vessel to demand some answers.

The main draw of this new slab of gameplay footage is a focus on all the characters joining Lance and Bill.


Bill Rizer and Lance whats-his-face were expected. Joining them are the previously announced Lucia and Ariana. Lucia has a grappling hook, but I’m not sure about Ariana. Her shots bounce in the trailer, so maybe that’s her special ability. Then there’s Stanley Ironside, who wears a big suit of armor and can hover. Finally, there’s the hero of the PAL regions: Probotector. Though technically already a canon character, the robot was birthed as a way of bypassing Germany’s censorship laws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever the versatile games, the first two Doom entries are staples of the dedicated mod community. With the original being crossed over with Doctor Who, it seems mixing franchises is not off the table for the plucky FPS. That also includes other titles from id Software.


Coming from ModDB user DASniperIC, their recent Doom 2 mod is a recreation of 1992's Wolfenstein 3D. Using the former's engine, they've been able to do a faithful reconstruction of the latter. While it doesn't look much different given that they're both retro shooters from a bygone era, you can tell it's Doom because of the UI at the bottom.


Image via DASniperIC/ModDB.


It doesn't appear as though this is a full remake of Wolfenstein, though. In the description, DASniperIC says the following:



The maps [sic] layout is basically exactly the same as in Wolfenstein 3D, there is a working chaingun and treasure, 3 bosses and some DEHACKED sillies to better mirror Wolf3D. And a surprise for MAP33 :)




Guten Tag, Doomguy


Given that it says there are three bosses, it's likely that this isn't a full recreation of Wolfenstein 3D. The original game has six bosses, so it's possible that this mod represents maybe half the game. The mention of something special on level 33 also suggests this. I haven't had a chance to play it yet, so I can't confirm that.


It never gets tiring seeing all the interesting modifications that are coming out for these absolute classic FPS games. While there could be a Wolfenstein 3 currently in development, there are evidently more than enough people keeping the old-school games alive and well, decades after their original release dates.

This, however, was bugged, with the feature being available even after loading into an activity.


Naturally, Bungie's original intention was to fix the bug and contain Vault access as it was originally envisioned, but that doesn't seem to be the plan any longer. According to Bungie's latest Reddit post, even though the bug will be fixed in a new hotfix, there are already plans to bring it back as an official feature "based on the positive reception [from the community]."

The iconic Hockenheim race track, featuring three unique track layouts and a whole suite of new vehicles to test on it.


Even though Forza Motorsport launched with a huge array of problems, especially on PC, the developer Turn 10 seems to be juggling both game fixes and the introduction of all-new content fairly well. The game's first post-launch track, Yas Marina, was released as part of Update 2 on November 14, and Hockenheim is being added into the mix almost exactly a month after it. As Update 3, too, promises a suite of stability and performance improvements alongside new content, this sets a steady pace for fans of the title.

Born of Bread isn't actually a baking sim. Even better than that: it's some kind of spin on vintage Ninty RPG Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, except that instead of being made of paper, the main character Loaf is made of living dough... but kind of looks like he's made of paper, this being a 2.5D game with flat character art. Look, just watch the trailer while I make myself a sandwich.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I had a feeling we'd see a lot of games about nature and plants and the wild coming out over the next few years, as developers and players alike emerged from being shut inside for basically a year like dairy cows during their annual spring turnout. We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.
Nine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and Universal's partnership has been a fruitful one. Universal Studios Japan's version of Super Nintendo World kicked it all off in late 2020 and early 2021 with a magical experience for Nintendo fans (learn more about our experience here), then in February 2023, Universal Studios Hollywood's Super Nintendo World opened its doors (see our photo tour of that version here). The collaboration to this point culminated shortly after that with the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which garnered strong fan reactions and grossed more than $1 billion at the box office.
While 2025 is the next major milestone for the collaboration, with Super Nintendo World locations opening in Singapore and Orlando, we got an announcement during a Universal Kick-Off media meeting. The big news pertaining to Super Nintendo World, as reported by Universal Parks News Today, is that the previously announced Donkey Kong Country expansion to Universal Studios Japan's park opens this coming spring. The expansion features a new rollercoaster starring the iconic ape, themed merchandise, more interactive experiences, and presumably themed decorations to make you feel like you've traveled to The Country.
While there are currently no plans for the Donkey Kong Country expansion to come to Universal Studios Hollywood, but according to Orlando Park Stop, Epic Universe in Orlando will be getting a mine-cart-themed Donkey Kong rollercoaster. Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios' Epic Universe is currently slated to open in 2025, but prior to that, it sounds as though the Osaka location will debut the DK attractions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Rockstar Games announced last week that it was going to release the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI on Tuesday, December 5. However, the studio released the trailer a day earlier – watch the official GTA VI reveal trailer here – after it leaked online. The trailer confirmed GTA VI will be released in 2025 and now, thanks to a new press release from Rockstar parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software, we know it's coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. 
Curiously, the press release only mentions those two platforms, leaving out PC. Here's what it says: 
Despite the popularity of Grand Theft Auto V on PC, it seems like GTA VI won't be launching on PC on day one. Of course, this doesn't mean the game won't eventually make its way to PC; GTA V eventually got there (albeit about a year and a half later). And Red Dead Redemption II didn't launch on PC either. 
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar Games to ask if a PC version of GTA VI is planned and, if there is one, when it will be released, and will update this story if more is learned. 
In the meantime, read about the first official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer here, and then check out some screenshots from the trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With thousands standing by waiting for it to release tomorrow, something happened and the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer just released. The 90-second-long features what looks to be mostly cutscenes, showing off a handful of locales including a massive city, a beach, and a bayou while playing Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road. The trailer ends with the GTA6 logo and coming 2025. Unfortunately, it appears as though the 2025 release date is only for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, with no mention of a PC release.




Even though the trailer was scheduled to release tomorrow, the trailer leaked which prompted Rockstar Games to go ahead and officially release the trailer early. I'm sure the leak wasn't ideal, but Rockstar was pretty quick to flip the trailer live after the leak popped up.

Return to Vice City


It's been long rumored that the highly anticipated sixth entry in the Grand Theft Auto series would bring a return to Vice City, and that looks to be the case. The trailer's title card features the classic Vice City pink and orange washed-out colors. Also, about halfway through the trailer, we see a Vice sign in the style of the Hollywood sign, which almost certainly confirms it.


Even though the video featured mostly cutscenes, it's safe to say this is exactly what everyone was hoping for: more Grand Theft Auto.


Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in 2025.

I wish we could get some sort of re-release, or maybe even a release of the canceled (but apparently finished) Primal Rage 2. But we’re not talking about Primal Rage. We’re here to look at DinoRex.


Released by Taito in 1992, DinoRex has a lot in common with Primal Rage. There are dinosaurs animated by stop-motion and humans in the foreground. I would use that same description for both games when trying to explain them to someone who hadn’t played them before. However, while Primal Rage is an “okay, not great” game, DinoRex is more of a “so bad it’s kind of good” kind of game—the very best flavor of kusoge.


It is just incredible.

        <updated>2023-12-04T22:45:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a surprise trailer dropped by the Street Fighter X (formerly Twitter) account, a crossover between Street Fighter 6 and Spy x Family Code: White is coming on January 9, 2024. The event serves as a promotion for the upcoming Spy x Family film, which will be released in Japanese theaters on December 22, 2023.


Aside from collaboration activities coming to Street Fighter 6 early next year, not much information was shown in the trailer. The X post said that additional information would be coming at a later date. 




Street Fighter 6 is no stranger to collaborations. Since its release on June 2, 2023, the fighter has joined forces with several popular franchises including Baki and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. While the Baki collaboration is relegated to fighter card aesthetics, the TMNT crossover had full-fledged costumes for all four Turtles.


This is where things get a little conflicting. While it was exciting to get the turtles in SF6, they came at a heavy cost, namely 750 Fighter Coins (roughly $15) each. So to get all four Turtles, players would have to drop about $60; and that didn't include all of the extras like stickers and what-have-you. Adding insult to injury was that the Turtles weren't actually characters; they were costumes for the player's avatar. Compared to the Turtles' inclusion in Injustice 2, whose pack was only $9.99 and had them as individual characters, it's kind of a raw deal in SF6.


While I'm excited about the prospect of two franchises I greatly enjoy crossing over like this, I'm hesitant about how Capcom will implement it. Either we get a bland pack like Baki or we get overpriced content that isn't usable outside of Avatar Battles. Here's hoping I'm totally wrong and we get an Anya and Bond combo utilizing Psycho Power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been a long time coming, and a new teaser trailer – arriving on Dragon Age Day, appropriately – provides a glimpse of its continent, Thedas, while also announcing when Bioware will properly reveal the game. 
The trailer provides a cinematic flyby of Thedas’ map and a few scenic shots of locales as out-of-context musings from several characters set the tone. It wraps up with a message announcing a full reveal coming next summer. 


It’s a bittersweet announcement. It’s good to know when we’ll finally see what Dreadwolf actually is. We're just bummed to get a teaser for a trailer that's months away. There’s always the chance Dreadwolf launches a few months after its grand debut (it’s happened before with several other big games), though the game was announced as being in the middle of full production last year, and with Bioware’s recent restructuring resulting in layoffs, a 2024 launch may be optimistic. 
Although Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been in development in some form since at least 2015, its first big teaser took place at The Game Awards in 2018. However, it didn’t get its proper title until last year. Dreadwolf has gone through the wringer in terms of development shake-ups, from high-profile departures at Bioware, including Casey Hudson (again), to EA reworking it from a live-service model to a more single-player-focused experience following Anthem’s failure. 
We still know very little about what Dreadwolf entails other than it takes place in Tevinter and will feature Solas (the titular Dread Wolf) and new characters Bellara and Davrin, whom we know nothing about as of yet. Here's hoping Bioware rolls out the carpet for the game in a big way next year after fans have waited so long to see what's next in the Dragon Age mythos.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starbreeze, the studio behind games such as Payday 3, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and The Darkness, has announced a partnership with Wizards of the Coast to develop and publish a new cooperative multiplayer game set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.
The title is codenamed Project Baxter and is slated to arrive in 2026. In a press release, Starbreeze states that Baxter is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and “will carry the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-Model, community engagement and a larger than life experience.” Although D&D is a role-playing game, it's unclear what genre Project Baxter will be. 
We are excited to unveil Dungeons & Dragons® as the IP for our next game, codename ”Project Baxter”. A co-operative multiplayer title to be released on all major platforms in 2026!

December 4, 2023
Project Baxter is slated to launch on all major platforms and will feature cross-play. Starbreeze released a piece of concept artwork, posted above, as a small visual hint of what's to come.
In a year where Baldur’s Gate 3 delivered on faithfully replicating the D&D experience in video games, Starbreeze has a lot to live up to. But as a D&D fan, it’s cool to see more triple-A projects based on the license, so hopefully Project Baxter turns out well.

Rather, you must call upon your mammalian mastery of spatial reasoning to survive. The insect hivemind, you see, is incapable of grasping the complexities of block positioning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next week, Mortal Kombat 1 is getting its second DLC fighter in the form of the Nether Realm’s favorite wizard, Quan Chi. His gameplay trailer makes no bones about the fact that he’s an extremely formidable fighter.
Quan Chi sports his usual arsenal of necromancy-based offense, such as summoning skeletons and firing skulls, but he can now conjure giant tentacles from presumably another reality. He also tag teams with upcoming Kameo fighter Khameleon, who becomes available in January. We particularly enjoy seeing Quan Chi and Shang Tsung make perhaps the most delightfully eye-rolling Deadly Alliance reference ever, plus the bonus tease of another impending guest fighter, Peacemaker, who arrives in February.  


Owners of Mortal Kombat 1’s Premium Edition or Kombat Pack get access to Quan Chi early on December 14. Everyone else will have to wait until December 21. Quan Chi follows Invincible’s Omni-Man, who hit the game last month, on the DLC character roadmap, leaving Ermac, Takeda, Peacemaker, and The Boys’ Homelander.

My assumption was that they would prove too strange to stomach, but much like the cursed pork and berry snack that became a staple of my university diet, the result is a thrilling concoction that delights the palette. I’ll say it right up top: Against The Storm is one of this year’s best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, Amazon Studios has released the first trailer for its upcoming TV adaptation of Fallout. The series is set to premiere on April 12 on Amazon Prime, and this teaser proves that visually speaking, the series appears to faithfully capture the essence of Bethesda’s beloved RPG.


Fallout is brought to life by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell as a freshly emerged Vault 33 dweller named Lucy and Walton Goggins as a gunslinging ghoul aptly dubbed “The Ghoul,” and the series synopsis reads as follows:
The trailer packs in what a lot of fans would expect from a Fallout adaptation: power armor, vaults, irradiated, mutated creatures, exploding headshots, and a dark sense of humor. Here's hoping it can live up to recent live-action success stories such as The Last of Us and Twisted Metal.
What do you think of this first look at Fallout? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a weird place with the Meta Quest. It's really its own platform these days, with its own specs and increasingly divergent library of games. At the same time, the Meta's standalone headsets are by far the most popular PCVR devices. Therefore, most PCVR gamers will also have access to the Quest's handful of VR exclusives. Generally, this column sticks to covering games you can play with any PCVR headset, Quest or no. But since I reviewed the Meta Quest 3 last month, it feels odd not to check out at least one of its new titles, especially when it's probably the most notable VR release of the year – Assassin's Creed Nexus.
Also, I'll admit, a VR Assassin's Creed game intrigues me. The idea of cavorting across historical rooftops and shanking templars in the sternum sounds brilliant. It also sounds like barf city. Most VR games limit the need to move around as much as possible, so translating a game as kinetic as Assassin's Creed into VR seems mighty challenging.

        <updated>2023-12-04T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Botany Manor is an enigmatic puzzle adventure game that tasks players with solving riddles to grow plants within a mysterious estate. The game first raised eyebrows during its reveal at a Nintendo Direct last November, and we can exclusively reveal that it’s arriving next spring.
Players control Arabella Greene, a retired botanist looking to bring life back to her massive collection of rare, long-lost plants. Doing this involves exploring a giant 19th-century manor in search of clues, notes, and other items to uncover the proper methods and conditions to make her plants grow. This involves finding the ideal habitats to place seedlings, for example, which may require some creative problem-solving and mature plants have mysterious qualities. 


As players find and examine clues, they’ll also learn about the ups and downs in Arabella’s life, both personally and professionally. Overall, the game has a peaceful atmosphere accented by a calming presentation and a pleasant soundtrack. Botany Manor is the debut title by the small team at Balloon Studios and is published by Whitethorn Games. 
Botany Manor is coming to Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. It will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

Alas, in the case of In Stars And Time, I've been thrown from its time-looping RPG trampoline with such violence that I now can't even look at it without breaking out into a sweat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From one AMD CPU to another - the last deal we posted was on an AM4 gaming-focused processor, the 5800X3D, and now we're looking at the opposite end of Team Red's lineup: the 7950X. This Zen 4 design includes 16 cores and 32 threads, making it their ultimate consumer CPU for highly threaded workloads like video production, 3D rendering... and yes, many video games too! 
This is still a pretty expensive processor, but it's a relative steal versus its launch price of £770. Amazon are now asking just £483 for this flagship-grade model, and that seems a fair price given just how well this CPU performs in everything from games to scientific computing and video rendering.

I'll put my hands up here - I really did intend to review this one properly when it came out back in July, and I regret never quite getting round to it. Time, as ever, escaped me in the run-up to Gamescom, but it was also one of the first games in a while where I felt I wasn't quite equipped to do it justice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside a new trailer showing what Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will sound like in English, Sega also confirmed Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name's English dub will release for free this month. The new trailer shows scenes that will be familiar to anyone who watched the Japanese trailer back in September, but it's nice to hear familiar voices connected to this new footage. The trailer also gives us a chance to hear Daniel Dae Kim's Masataka Ebina and Danny Trejo's Dwight. Here's what Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has to say about the two characters.
Ebina is the de-facto leader for the Seiryu Clan, a yakuza syndicate whose current chairman is incarcerated. Dwight leads the Barracudas gang in Hawaii and supervises the world's largest counterfeit goods market, aided by his sharp sense of business and even sharper machete.


Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth releases January 26 PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turns out CD Projekt has even more plans for Cyberpunk beyond its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty earlier this year. During a stream detailing the update with developers Paweł Sasko and Monika Janowska, the team at CD Projekt revealed Cyberpunk will be getting a 2.1 update soon that will add a fully functional metro, radioport, replayable car races, boss fight improvements, accessibility features, and more. The update will be available December 5 (the same day Rockstar is launching the trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto), which will also mark the release of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition.
The metro system, called NCART in the game, lets players move around the city and take in the views. The Radioport will let players listen to music outside of vehicles. The update will also allow players to to invite their in-game significant others to "quality time" together in V's apartment. The other previously mentioned updates are a little more self-explanatory, though CD Projekt did specifically mention that the boss updates were specifically applied to the late-game encounter with Adam Smasher. He is also now equipped with Sandevistan, which was seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. New vehicles will be added like the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and others, motorcycle handling has been improved, and there are also technical updates like larger fonts and the option to turn off timers in the Breach Protocol minigame.
As stated, the 2.1 patch launches December 5 on all platforms. To read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review, follow the link. You can also read our Phantom Liberty review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing that it would be releasing a trailer in early December about a month ago, Rockstar confirmed an exact date and time this morning. The trailer for the next be Grand Theft Auto will premiere Tuesday December 5 at 9 a.m. ET.
pic.twitter.com/BguwiJokQt
December 1, 2023
Rockstar shared the tweet above without any context, so it's worth noting that it is technically not confirming that this trailer will be for the next Grand Theft Auto. All it says is "Trailer 1" and a date. But, considering its early November tease explicitly read, "We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto," it's safe to assume that this is what the tweet is referencing.
The art of the tweet also offers the first official tease for the game's tropical setting. It has long been rumored that the next Grand Theft Auto would return to Vice City and a massive leak in September where 90 video related to the game also made that apparent.


If you're on a video game website reading about Grand Theft Auto, it's safe to assume that the excitement surrounding this game does not need to contextualized, but the previous Grand Theft Auto is one of the video game industry's biggest hits of all time. In 2018 it was crowned the most profitable entertainment product of all time.


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

I mean, just look at this trailer for Ironwood's Vandemeerian vehicle survival roguelike Pacific Drive. How am I supposed to be satisfied with some stupid road after watching that? What's the point of cars if there are no floating cryptid lifeforms, inexplicable walls of energy or lost research facilities involved?

Enki has big cute ears and a beaver's tail, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's related to one of those awful, many-limbed gods Flintlock's protagonist Nor Vanek is trying to slay. 


I'm sorry, it's my first time writing about Flintlock, and I realise the "OMG it has a cat!" ship has probably long since sailed. Only hang on, Ed thinks Enki is a squirrel, while Graham thinks it's a dog. Which of us is correct? Developer A44 Games describe Enki as "fox-like", further muddying the waters. There's only one thing for it: you'll have to watch the video and decide for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am late to walk the Path of Exile. Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. 


I am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After suffering a delay to next year, we now know that the driving-focused roguelite survival game Pacific Drive is arriving on February 22.
The news comes courtesy of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. Pacific Drive is a first-person adventure that unfolds in a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest. Players drive a station wagon to explore a forest filled with supernatural threats related to a government agency’s experiments gone wrong. Check out a recent story trailer below.  


As a run-based game, the world shifts with every trip into the forest, and the only thing keeping you alive is your trusty vehicle, which you’ll repair, reinforce, and modify using materials found while exploring the unsettling landscapes. Your car will need to stay up to snuff in order to withstand dangers such as the Zone Storm, a recurring maelstrom that obliterates everything in its path, meaning players will have to outrun it to stay alive. 
Pacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC. For more on the game, you can check out our extended preview of the game here.]]></summary>

Things aren't looking great for Starfield - or at least, they're looking mixed, as in the Steam reviews, and verified but nameless devs are responding to negative reviews with comments that are basically like "no, our space game is fun and you're playing it wrong". We laugh about this (but also discuss the role of Steam reviews and devs replying to them). As well as that, the lads have been playing, well, the same sort of stuff this week, James brings us talk of mini PCs, and Nate makes us play Dracula or Russell Crowe. Extremely normal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom's fantasy action-RPG Dragon's Dogma 2 will sell for $69.99 - $70, if you disregard the usual "deduct one cent to fool silly left-to-right readers into thinking it's significantly cheaper" gambit - when it releases in March 2024. If you're in the UK, the figure is currently £53.98 on Steam. It's the first time Capcom have sold the base edition of a game for $70 in the US of A, and follows comments this September from a Capcom executive that videogames are priced "too low" these days, based on how much games cost to make.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rome wasn't built in a day, but in sci-fi strategy game Stellaris Nexus, you can found, expand and fritter away a whole intergalactic empire in around an hour. In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or "Succession" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. 


I did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much "lions led by donkeys" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.

In my review, I wrote that the game’s “ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort.” That effort can be attributed to Don’t Nod honing in on the game’s central mechanic, climbing, and building a fascinating world and lore around it. I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We found out last August that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024, but a new teaser gave us another glimpse at its newest star: Shadow the Hedgehog.
I say “another” because Shadow briefly appears during Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s mid-credits scene, setting him up as presumably the antagonist of the third film. While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes.

November 29, 2023
Production on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).
Whatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.]]></summary>

At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is arriving early next year. The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. 
According to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:
The store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.

According to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” 
"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year," Ubisoft wrote in the statement. 
Beyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. 
Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom held a new showcase for Dragon’s Dogma 2, showing off more of the game’s fantastical action but giving fans the one thing they’ve wanted most: a release date. The hotly anticipated sequel is coming on March 22.
If that date looks familiar, that’s because it was accidentally leaked not once but twice. The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date. The second leak occurred just hours before today’s presentation courtesy of the game’s Steam page. But if you missed both early reveals, today is probably a nice surprise. 
A new trailer shows off more of the game’s story while also offering up new gameplay footage. The trailer showcases the new Trickster Vocation alongside new enemies, such as the towering statue, mythical beasts, and, naturally, dragons. 


Dragon’s Dogma 2 is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossover skins are extremely commonplace for in-game stores in 2023, and Among Us is no different. Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.

The update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. "We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up," the patch notes read. "We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!"
This is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle. You can watch the launch trailer right here.
Are you planning on trying out the new cosmetics in Among Us? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, something odd happened in the streets of Gotham. With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.


The collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit "at a later date."
Game Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024. If you want to stick to the classics, Batman: Arkham Trilogy launches this Friday, December 1.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.


Rogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.

The images showcase all the classic iconography you'd expect from the series, including vaults, ghouls, and power armor.
The Vanity Fair article goes on to give us the first concrete details of the show, thanks to an interview with co-creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, who also created Westworld. The series will star Ella Purnell as Lucy, a "doe-eyed" woman who emerges from her vault with naivete and optimism but is forced to face the horrors of the wasteland. 
"Lucy is charming and plucky and strong," Nolan says. "And then you see she’s confronted with the reality of, hey, maybe the supposedly virtuous things you …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3's next update, Patch 5, will address various performance issues caused by the bountiful fantasy RPG's previous patch. The source of the lag? No, it's got nothing to do with teeth. According to Larian, the slowdowns are actually connected to the game's understanding of crime and morality: Patch 4 left it unable to "forget" player thefts and acts of vandalism that haven't been detected by NPCs, meaning that BG3 players who break the rules often and get away with it have been saddling their simulations with unfinished tasks. That's right, the game's latest technical crisis is in fact a crisis of conscience. Oh the  humanity!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since premiering in late October, Five Nights at Freddy’s has become a big box-office success. It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.
The film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). 
Five Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. 
FNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail
November 27, 2023


First announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us.

Originally slated to launch on February 27, The Final Shape now launches on June 4. In a blog post, Bungie states that the expansion “needs more time to become exactly what we want it to be”.
“The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together,” Bungie writes in the post. “We want to honor that journey, so we’re taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese company ByteDance is best known for its ownership of TikTok, the international video platform, but it owns a number of other companies as well. One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to "divest from titles already launched." This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.
However, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.
Dear SNAPPERS,
November 27, 2023
It's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere. However, the fates of the workers at Nuverse and the company's other games are unclear, as Reuters reports that "the decision is likely to impact hundreds of employees." The report states that ByteDance will announce this restructure sometime today.

Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation.

The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically.

Miles Morales is a comic book character created to represent people of color.
Leading up to the 2008 election, which resulted in the United States’ first African American president, Barack Obama, Marvel wanted to "take a good look" at one of their icons to reimagine as African American. A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles. Every iteration of the character continues this legacy of representation, and Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man 2 is no different.

Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.
It all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.
In free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a story that likely sounds familiar to anyone who works in video games, or even plays a lot of games. Every year around this time, a few friends and family members ask for game-buying advice. That’s great, as I love having the opportunity to help someone find gaming experiences that will lead to a great time. But it can be especially challenging if the giftee in question is a younger child who wants to play games, but is perhaps too young or inexperienced with the hobby to know what they might enjoy. We’re here to help with a brief rundown of some foolproof suggestions for parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, or anyone looking to find the perfect holiday gift for the young game player.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio released its second – and not to mention best – game of 2023, the hilariously longly titled Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on. 
We recently had a chat with RGG series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto – who we spoke with last year about the future of the studio – to learn how Gaiden's new combat together, maintaining the series' identity despite how much has changed over the years, and why RGG doesn't look to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On this special Thanksgiving episode of The Game Informer Show Podcast, we discuss which fictional video games birds would taste the best. We talk about some video games, too. Charles Harte talks about Chants of Sennaar, a puzzle game about language, and Kyle Hilliard talks about Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a game about beating up people on the streets of a fictional Japanese city. Kyle also touches on Assassin's Creed VR before the duo moves on to the main course: ranking fictional video game birds on criteria like how tasty do they look and how bad would we feel about eating them. After that, we finish out the show with some gestures of gratitude and reader questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ah, Thanksgiving. It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?
And that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.
Here's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy is a staple in JRPGs and video games as a whole. It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. 
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers…]]></summary>

In Spider-Man’s case, that’s only true some of the time. But the web-slinger has had so many video games (and series of games) that he’s racked up an alarming number of “Spider-Man 2” games, so with the latest iteration currently printing money for PlayStation, it’s time to finally reflect on and rank all of them. What’s the best second Spider-Man game? The answer may mildly surprise you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.
