After announcing Rambo and Stranger Things would eventually become a part of Far Cry 6, Ubisoft added yet another license to the mix. This one has a great tie to antagonist Antón Castillo, who is brought to life by actor Giancarlo Esposito. Players can now download Breaking Bad-inspired bundles to bring Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants and trucks to the world.
Esposito won't be in character as Breaking Bad's Gus Fring, but his eateries will certainly remind you of him. You can also wear Heisenberg-themed gear to further blend the game and TV show universes.
No half-measures here! Hide in plain sight at Los Pollos Hermanos or channel your inner Heisenberg with these bundles inspired by the smash hit television series. pic.twitter.com/q8xctfNLce

This new content also ties into today's new DLC, Vaas's Insanity. Vaas' look and voice are from actor Michael Mando, who just happens to play Nacho Varga in Breaking Bad's prequel series, Better Call Saul. Vaas is the villain from Far Cry 3, and this DLC gives you the chance to play as him and learn more about his backstory.
This DLC is the first part of a villain-focused season pass that retails for $40. The second and third acts give players control of Pagan Min from Far Cry 4 and Joeseph Seed from Far Cry 5.
The trailer above gives you a look at what you can expect from Vaas' return, which is supposedly designed like a roguelite.
Are you still playing Far Cry 6? Do you have any interest in the villain's gameplay? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

The report also highlights several instances where Activision CEO Bobby Kotick was reportedly aware of the allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors and, in one instance, intervened to prevent an alleged harasser from being fired.

In response to the report, employee group A Better ABK have called for Kotick to be replaced as CEO and are organising a staff walkout.

He addresses the article by saying it "paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership." 
"I want to say is that anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn’t really appreciate how important this is to me," says Kotick in the message. "Creativity and inspiration thrives best in a safe, welcoming, respectful environment. There is no substitute for that.

The world is more fun when these things collide, isn't it? They're everywhere!  Today, the Transformers come to Hi-Rez moba Smite. Smite has had a notable amount of crossover material over the years, everything from The Legend of Korra to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Today, the roster of brands gets bigger as the Autobots roll out into the land of the gods. As with other collaborations, the new skins layer over existing gods, so don't expect to actually get a tailored Optimus Prime moveset or anything, though you will look quite stylish.
The skins you can acquire consist of Optimis Prime for Geb, Megatron for Ra (!), and Starscream for Jing Wei. Of the three, you definitely want the Megatron one, right? Ra is a lot of fun anyway, so doing him up as Megatron is sure to be a blast. You can check out a lot more at the trailer right here!

The tale of a boy and a yeti is coming in 2022 with Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. Lovable moments and snowball fights are sure to happen in this title, which is scheduled to land on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Playstation 5, Switch, and PC. You can learn a lot more about the game and even see it in action a bit in the trailer below!

In case you're wondering who's who, Nunu is the child, and he's looking for his mom. Willump is the yeti and will help Nunu make his way through the frozen wastes and hopefully find his mom! Nunu also has a magic flute that can alter the environment in a number of ways. Or you can just make Willump dance, which is always nice. A mix of puzzling challenges and journeying through icy environs, the adventure is marked with story beats and relationship building as well, as Nunu and Willump form an unbreakable friendship. According to the developers, it's a game about friendship, family, and joy. Hard to argue with that, really. We look forward to seeing just where this warm story in frigid lands takes us in 2022.
Are you looking forward to Song of Nunu: A League of Legends story or any of the other announcements from the Riot Forge showcase today? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

"It's time to save Bilgewater, Captain." Honestly, with a name like Bilgewater, we feel like the town might be pre-destined to suffer — but in Ruined King: A League of Legends Story, a spin-off from the mightily popular MOBA League of Legends, that's your task.
Announced as a surprise release on Switch today, Ruined King is a turn-based single-player RPG that was originally slated for early 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, musical artist Ed Sheeran announced on Twitter that an upcoming collaboration is happening with Pokémon Go. In this day and age when Naruto is in Fortnite and celebrities are tied to all kinds of products via these projects, it's actually not that surprising. 
Pokémon has had a deluge of crossovers and collaborative projects over its long lifetime, and seeing Ed Sheeran make the jump from Game of Thrones (and other media!) over to Pokémon is sure to be interesting. With Pokémon being one of the world's most powerful entertainment brands, extending well outside of the gaming sphere into movies, merch, and much more, this partnership is hardly unusual. But how will it play out, exactly?
Coming soon.. x #PokemonGOxEdSheeran pic.twitter.com/8LDcIsVe78
November 16, 2021
The exact nature of this collaboration is anyone's guess, what do you think the artist has in store for the mobile Pokémon game? Are we going to spin magical Ed Sheeran Pokéstops or gyms? Who knows. Maybe we can click to get the new album while we play with our Bulbasaurs. What do you think the collaboration will look like? Perhaps Sheeran will actually become a canonical Pokémon. I mean, it's not that far off in a world where we have Pokémon that are ya know, keychains. So, what do you think this is going to be? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

The Game Awards are coming, airing on 9th December to grace us with game trailers, adverts for PC gear and occasionally some game awards. Ok, we've been a tad snarky there, but it is a big annual event in the gaming calendar and the Switch has some notable nominees this time around.
The most exciting is Metroid Dread being up for Game of the Year, which is an awesome achievement. It's up against some tough competition, and like every other category it's fan-voted - you need to create a sign-in and vote on this official Game Awards page. Below are the nominees.

The Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack launched recently, not without its share of critics. Despite some emulation flaws and an inability to change button mapping in the app, however, it has nevertheless been rather fun to revisit some familiar (and less familiar) Nintendo 64 gems on the Switch. Of course we always want more.

At first we got ports years after their Xbox debut, then Microsoft just stopped releasing Windows versions for their flagship first-person shooter series. Well, that's changing with Halo Infinite, which is coming to PC at the same time as Xbox—including the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta launched last night. So I ask you, an audience with less exposure to the sci-fi shooter: how are you liking it, PC gamers?

Of course, the title of the game refers to what’s assumed to be a powerful force in the game as well, the League of Legends character Viego. You can get a look at what to expect in the trailer below!

Several additional price points exist beyond the standard edition of the game. The digital deluxe edition comes with Ruined skins for characters and bonus items, while the physical Collector’s Edition comes with an art book, sketch, soundtrack, cloth map, notebook/pen, and a mug. You’re going to need coffee for all that grinding, right?  
Ruined King: A League of Legends Story release date was delayed last December with no timeframe, but it looks like that time is now!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't really have the luxury of devoting a cool 500 words to a single character in my Sherlock Holmes Chapter One review, firstly because I'm a believer in word economy, but secondly because what I wanted to talk about is a bit of a spoiler. It's integral to the plot of the game and it's revealed very quickly once you start playing, but it's also not mentioned in any of the promo blurbs or marketing, so I'm guessing it's meant to be a fun little "Oh!" moment. On the other hand, I do really want to talk about how cool Sherlock's best mate Jon is...
So if you want to go into Frogwares' new detect 'em up cold, then save this and come back to it after you've played about, ooh, 45 minutes? I think that's long enough to get clear of spoiler territory.

We live in an age of quirky Nintendo peripherals; Ring Fit Adventure is an example where Nintendo took a relatively standard Yoga ring and cleverly turned it into a huge sales success. Third-parties join in too, of course, and let's not forget Nintendo's own Labo range that made cardboard cool.
For those with a retro perspective, though, the NES / Game Boy era was a golden age for quirky accessories, and the video above from The Retro Future showcases a version of a Game Boy Sewing Machine. It's a rather funny walkthrough on how machines were designed to hook up to a Game Boy and related software to make sewing easier. Once you get past the 'is this a real thing?' part of the topic, it's actually rather fascinating.

You play as a stranger, Aiden, travelling to this once-majestic capital to locate his missing sister, and the second you step foot into its guarded walls you’re faced with a city kitbashed together from pieces of Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Ostrow and other European landmarks. In Villedor proper – a city that’s been designed by actual town planners and urban designers – you see the scope of what Techland is going for. This is a big game, with some big ideas.

It all started in 2019 when I saw a beyond-impressive gameplay demo at E3. The game, then scheduled for a 2020 release, blew away my already-high expectations. I enjoyed the original Dying Light, but felt that with a little bit of iteration and polish, the series could evolve into something truly special. Those hopes were delivered upon during that E3 2019 demo, and Dying Light 2 skyrocketed up my list of the most anticipated games of 2020.
Sadly, in the early stages of last year, Techland announced a delay to 2021. Then, after announcing a December 2021 release date, the developer delayed the game one (hopefully) final time, with the title now scheduled to release on February 4, 2022. It's been…]]></summary>

Few games have captured the imagination quite like Dying Light 2 Stay Human. Developer Techland's ambitious open-world title has the potential to wow players with meaningful choices, a beautiful space to cause chaos, and satisfying zombie slaying. While Dying Light 2 has stayed in the shadows for the majority of the last few years, today, we're giving you a new look into this undead nightmare.
That's right, join Brian Shea and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a tour of Techland's next title. The aforementioned Mr. Shea got to go to his first in-person press event in two years to get hands-on with both the PS4 Pro version of the game along with the beefed-up PC version.
During today's fresh episode of New Gameplay Today, the gents show off Dying Light 2's improved combat system and discuss how the game has improved since the original. They also dive into the famous parkour and detail how players will be able to use new gear like the paraglider to help them get around the expansive and terrifying open world. We also dive into a bit of the story, including what actor Rosario Dawson's character will be doing, but nothing that would overtly spoil any major story beats. The duo unpacks a lot more, but you're going to have to watch the latest NGT to learn more.
If you enjoyed our latest look at Dying Light 2 Stay Human, be sure to check out Brian Shea's written impressions of his time with Techland's latest title ahead of its February 4, 2022 release date!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A chaser.
The weight of expectation can be a terrible thing for a game. When you expect nothing, every moment has the potential to offer a surprise and an unanticipated feeling of discovery, and the original Toree 3D benefited from absolute zero expectations when it launched back in April. Releasing out of nowhere for a bargain basement price, Diplodocus Games served up a very short but exceptionally sweet low-poly platformer. It was rudimentary, yes, but far bigger, far more expensive 3D platformers have failed to nail the fundamentals like developer Siactro did with Toree, and it was a wonderful and very welcome surprise.
Toree 2, a similarly-sized and priced sequel, feels more-or-less like a level pack for the first game (which incidentally got an update with extra levels to coincide with this game's launch), so we recommend reading our mini review of that pint-sized platformer — it's the same hold-'Y'-to-dash 3D platforming deal as before. Describing it as a glorified level pack might sound like a negative, but it's the sort of thing a developer can get away with when they're only charging $0.99 / £0.89, and Siactro does throw in some new elements here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows has contributed two iconic images to the public consciousness: the default Windows XP wallpaper; and the blue screen of death. But they cut Bliss decades ago, and Windows 11 put the final nail in the coffin of Windows' pop culture relevancy by turning the blue screen of death into a black screen of death. A tragedy. Thankfully, Microsoft have now seen the cerulean light, and are planning to restore the azure annihilator in a future patch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer beta hasn’t even been out for 24 hours and is already breaking records. According to Video Games Chronicle, 343’s popular FPS space opera amassed over 270,000 concurrent players on Steam, the first Xbox Studios game to reach such notable player-count heights in such a short period. 
This feat is even more impressive when considering the surprise announcement (sure, rumors might’ve been circulating over the weekend) during yesterday’s 20th Anniversary stream. While progression carrying over to the base game – acquired cosmetics, battle pass unlocks, and general experience points – and the Halo namesake are central selling points, it was hard to gauge where the player-count numbers would wind up. Yet (as seen below), other acclaimed Xbox Studios titles like Forza Horizon 5 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection, while very successful in their own right, have not seen the same immediate success on Steam. 
Halo Infinite is now the first ever Xbox Studios Game to pass 200k+ concurrent players on Steam and set the all-time record

November 15, 2021
Halo Infinite is in good company, having the fourth largest player peak on Monday under Steam heavyweights like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and PUBG. Developer 343 Industries has a lot to be happy about. 
Totals on Xbox and the PC app haven’t been confirmed yet. Still, it’s safe to assume that the latest multiplayer installment in the Halo franchise is being enjoyed by a bevy of players on all available platforms. With news of the Season One battle pass extending until next May – an unorthodox amount of time, quite frankly – fans should have a ton of additional content rollouts to supplement the already-strong multiplayer and upcoming singleplayer component. 
Halo Infinite launches for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 8.
What platform have you been playing the beta on? What’s your experience been like? Let us know in the comments below!

It's a big anniversary year with The Legend of Zelda turning 35, but it's also notable that 21st November brings us the 30th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past arriving in Japan. It's one of the greatest games in the series, and indeed gaming history, and of course fans will be celebrating in various ways.
A rather fun project is from The Game Brass, which you can glimpse in the trailer above. This group has been producing brass-focused arrangements of classic game music for three years, and is the latest group to make its next album a little different. A Link to the Brass won't just be an album of the game's soundtrack on various streaming services, but will also be an option for integration into ROMs of the game.

Earth Atlantis arrived on the Switch eShop over four years ago, catching the eye with its hand-drawn visual style and its shoot 'em up 'monster hunting' approach. We were big fans in our original review and it's a title that's probably dropped into a number of libraries through big sales on the download store.
For keen physical edition collectors in North America it's been a long wait, but now publisher VGNYsoft is stepping in to bring a physical release to the region; it's worth noting that it's NA only, as international shipping isn't an option.

Yesterday, UK chart data showed that Shin Megami Tensei V managed to earn a ninth-place spot in its opening week on the market. For a JRPG exclusive to a Nintendo platform in a physical-only UK chart, that's pretty impressive going, and further analysis offers a better insight into just how well it's performed.
GamesIndustry.biz's Christopher Dring has shared some interesting sales comparisons between Atlus' new game and previous JRPG releases in the UK. He notes that SMTV managed "60% more sales at launch than Bravely Default II, 43% more than Monster Hunter Stories 2 and 23% more than Tales of Arise". As a reminder, all of this data relates to boxed sales only.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barry Hattrick has just signed a two-year contract with Stockport County FC. The 36-year-old former full-back, a Stockport native and lifelong fan of the Vanarama National League club, has a tactical style best described as 'my dad after three pints'. Route-one, 4-4-2, and no 'larking about'. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.
Hattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It's been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football's favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they've had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.

If you've been patiently waiting for Doctor Who: The Edge of Reality to launch on Nintendo Switch, you'll be pleased to know that its release is finally just around the corner.
You might recall that the game, which stars none other than actual 'Doctors' Jodie Whittaker and David Tennant, was originally supposed to launch for Switch on 30th September. It was soon pushed back to 14th October (when it launched on other systems), before being delayed again to 28th October – which didn't happen either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you're left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you're meant to proceed. It wouldn't be much of a puzzle game if there weren't a few moments like this, of course, but when you're playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you're really desperate, an in-game video solution). 
When the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion's debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios' The Room series. It's a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.

Switch exclusive Shin Megami Tensei V contains references to PS4 and PC in its code, a datamine has revealed.
Features specific to PC, such as resolution settings, post-processing and texture quality have also been found. The GeForce Now leak from earlier this year made reference to the game coming to PC, despite Nvidia's insistence at the time that the leaked list was purely for "internal tracking and testing". It's worth noting that since the leak, several of the listed titles have been confirmed for release on PC.

In a dim, empty room, on a small table, lies a cube. Moncage dumps players right into the action with a few quick notes on how to manipulate this multi-faceted object. It tasks you with connecting similar objects found on the box’s different planes by spinning the cube and looking at things from unique perspectives. At first, the challenge seems simple. However, as the game progresses, puzzles grow more sophisticated, and the seemingly unconnected scenes reflected on the cube’s sides begin to weave into a narrative. I only wish that narrative had more substance.
Each side of Moncage’s six-sided cube displays a distinct vignett…]]></summary>

During the tech test of Halo Infinite that took place this summer, players took to the various maps to get their first taste of 343 Industries' upcoming free-to-play multiplayer. While many came away impressed by the ways Halo Infinite's multiplayer feels true to the series' renowned roots, nearly as many players were blown away by how impressive the A.I. bots were in battle. 
When firing up the multiplayer starting today, players can reunite with the bots who likely headshotted them into oblivion through The Academy, a mode that serves as an on-ramp for players looking to enter the competitive fires. "Multiplayer is…]]></summary>

One of our most anticipated games this year, Solar Ash, was originally slated to arrive earlier in the season but is now hitting just ahead of the frostiest time of the year. And while the nights are getting darker sooner, there are still plenty of bright indie launches we’ve got our eye on for the rest of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first teaser trailer for Microsoft and Xbox’s upcoming Halo TV series has been released and it features just a small snippet of what we can expect in the full show. 
Set to launch on Paramount+ next year, the show follows Master Chief, played by Pablo Schreiber, and Cortana, voiced by Jen Taylor. The teaser itself isn’t anything too wild – it features about what you’d expect from a Halo TV series teaser – but it’s still neat to see Master Chief’s iconic helmet in a live-action format such as this. 
Click here to watch embedded media


You can check it out above – as you can see, it’s short and sweet, featuring a brief glimpse at Schreiber’s Master Chief and the voice of Taylor’s Cortana. 
Elsewhere in the cast, we know that Natascha McElhone, of Californication fame, will be playing Dr. Halsey, the person responsible for turning John 117 into the Master Chief we all know and love today. Little else is known about the show, however, but we’ll learn more sometime next year when Halo hits Paramount+. 
While waiting for that, prepare for what’s next in the world of Halo by checking out Game Informer’s Halo Infinite game hub. There, you’ll find a 4K first look at the game’s opening level, an exclusive reveal of a weapon new to the Halo universe, our thoughts on Halo Infinite after going hands-on with it, and more.

This news dropped during today’s Xbox 20th Anniversary stream (although rumors were swirling about such an announcement over the weekend) and it’s been revealed that Halo Infinite multiplayer is launching today as a beta. However, unlike previous beta-like technical previews for 343 Industries’ latest go at Halo multiplayer, all progression in the beta carries over to the full launch on December 8.

In the Xbox Wire post detailing these classic additions, Xbox compatibility program lead Peggy Lo wrote about ending the preservation service, stating the newly added 70+ games are the "latest and final addition." She goes on to describe the current hurdles for adding any other games to the back-compat list, saying, "While we continue to stay focused on preserving and enhancing the art form of games, we have reached the limit of our ability to bring new games to the catalog from the past due to licensing, legal and technical constraints."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The simple explanation of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a game where you embody the nascent consulting detective, aged 21, returning to Cordona, the Mediterranean island where he spent time as a child. It's a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season's Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there's yer preamble.
But the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, "This is Frogwares' world and we're all just living in it!" and, "What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I've ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he'd also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. 
Obviously, you don't need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don't technically need the telegraph machine either, as there's an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn't half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The immense benefits of the Xbox-Bethesda acquisition continue to trickle down as new IPs (Starfield) and upcoming chapters in revolutionary franchises (Elder Scrolls VI) are being developed for next-gen technology. At E3, we learned that the former will be an Xbox exclusive and Day One Game Pass addition. Information surrounding the next Elder Scrolls title, however, has been much harder to come across. Still, a GQ interview with Xbox’s leading man Phil Spencer unearthed some exciting new details about Bethesda’s flagship video game series. Nothing is confirmed yet, but Phil Spencer envisions Elder Scrolls VI as an Xbox exclusive. 
This exclusivity would be a groundbreaking decision for the games community and the western RPG scene if cleared. “Starfield, arguably the biggest game of 2022, will be Xbox and PC only,” the GQ article reads. “Spencer says he sees the same for The Elder Scrolls VI.” Spencer himself went on to say that having sole rights to both highly-anticipated Bethesda titles isn’t about “punishing any other platform.” Instead, “In order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about Elder Scrolls VI. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”
The Elder Scrolls VI might use the same overhauled engine as Starfield, but its release is still far off. Todd Howard confirmed that the game is still in its “design phase.” This, of course, is a little deflating, considering the first teaser was released three years ago. On the other hand, Starfield drops next year on November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
Do you think the Elder Scrolls VI will be an exclusive or is that simply wishful thinking? Drop your theories in the comments section below!

You might expect that a second Sker-y game would follow a similar formula. Nope. This weekend, the developers announced Sker Ritual, a co-op shooter in which you'll need to survive an onslaught of ghouls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The famed bounty hunter Boba Fett is coming to Fortnite in just a little over a month. 
This news comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which announced the news as part of Disney Plus Day last week. Perhaps an early Christmas present for those that celebrate the holiday, Boba Fett will be added to Fortnite (presumably as a purchasable skin in the Item Shop) on December 24. 
It’s excellent timing, too, because Disney’s upcoming Disney Plus show about the bounty hunter, The Book of Boba Fett, launches five days later on December 29. 
Boba Fett will be making his arrival on the Island December 24, 2021 at 7pm ET! #DisneyPlusDay pic.twitter.com/cj9iC6WRBZ
November 12, 2021
As you can see in the Tweet above, Boba Fett is pictured on a throne with Fennec Shand, who is played by Ming-Na Wen in The Mandalorian, right beside him. It’s unclear if Fennec Shand will be joining the Fortnite roster, and while it would be cool, the actual words that accompany the image in the tweet suggest that just Boba Fett is joining the game. 
Only time will tell for now – you only have to wait about six more weeks to find out. While waiting for that, check out the first trailer from The Book of Boba Fett and then read about how Dark Phoenix from X-Men is being added to Fortnite. Read about how something from Naruto Shippuden is coming to Fortnite soon after that. Then, check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and DC superheroes and supervillains in Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 11/15/21: 
Rockstar’s new remastered trilogy of Grand Theft Auto III, San Andreas, and Vice City, collectively known as Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, is playable once more on PC. It’s also available for purchase again. 
This comes after the PC version of the trilogy was unplayable and not available for purchase beginning November 12 as Rockstar’s launcher, which must be used to play the trilogy on PC, went offline. The launcher (and subsequent ability to play the game and purchase it on PC) was brought back online yesterday. 
Rockstar announced this by way of a tweet yesterday and, in the same tweet, the company says it sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience and that it is “working to improve and update overall performance as we move forward.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Server transfers were introduced to New World last month, letting players boot their characters to a new world. It was implemented as a way to ease queue times in the popular MMORPG, but didn't work completely to plan - it caused a gold duping glitch, and some players have been blocked from transferring altogether. Amazon Games say they're currently working on resolving these blockages, and are planning a second round of server transfers before the year's end, so everyone has a chance to jump worlds.

The remastered collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas looks a right mess but apparently the reason for its vanishing was they had accidentally left in files they shouldn't have, which include songs that weren't meant to be in the game. Well, it's back on sale now, and it still looks a mess. Hey Rockstar, maybe now consider putting the original versions back on sale too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. After running down Samus' 2D outings, we’re ready to venture into the world of 3D with Metroid Prime.
Released on November 17, 2002 for Nintendo's Gamecube, Metroid Prime is often considered one of the best games of its era. However, to better understand Metroid Prime's influence we first have to go back to the tumultuous founding of Retro Studios. In order to develop Metroid Prime, Retro canceled four other projects, and even then many of its designers almost didn't survive development. In the end, Retro created a total masterpiece that feels ahead of its time. Join us as we talk about Retro's struggles, why Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the morph ball was essential to the formula, and how we almost saw Kraid in 3D. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, Game Informer's own Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime's lore, development history, and lasting impact.

In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I'll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and "HD" texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that McDevitt is back at the company just seven months after leaving it. In that time, he began working for developer Illogika Games. When he left Ubisoft back in March, McDevitt said he wanted to take on “a new adventure” and it seems he either finished up that adventure or decided he preferred ones where hidden blades are involved.

Of course, since this series follows the events of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, we know that old apprentice is Anakin Skywalker no more. He’s Darth Vader now. As far as we know, Obi-Wan hasn’t yet seen Anakin as Vader in between the end of Revenge of the Sith and the start of this series so it seems we’ll get to see them meet for the first time on-screen. 
We’ll also get to see Obi-Wan actor, Ewan McGregor, share the screen with Anakin actor, Hayden Christensen, for the first time in years during this series. Neither of these actors has ma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In honor of the first anniversary of the launch of PlayStation 5, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan took to the PlayStation Blog to take a look back at the year that was as well as what's to come.
Even for a year where it felt like PS5 consoles were hard to find (and still are!), gamers put in plenty of time on the now-current gen device. "PS5 gamers have collectively played more than 4.6 billion hours of gameplay on PS5 and broadcast more than 26 million hours of content," Ryan boasted. No doubt there's been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. 
Fortnite
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
FIFA 21
NBA 2K21
Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
Destiny 2
MLB The Show 21
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Demon’s Souls
NBA 2K22
It's great to see Miles Morales and Demon's Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they're day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. 
Jim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.
Despite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it's had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade. That is if you're lucky enough to find one in the coming months. 
What's your most played games on PS5 this year? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

While the games are a blast on their own merits, many fans remember punching in the copious amounts of cheat codes to make each title even more delightfully absurd. Most of these cheats apply to the Definitive Editions and we've gathered all of them here in one place. 
To activate the cheats, simply enter the correct button prompts while in-game. Keep in mind that Rockstar has already warned that an unspecified "couple of cheats" have been removed from The Definitive Editions due to technical reasons. If a code doesn't work, that's likely the reason. Also, using cheats will lock certain trophies/achievements so be sure…]]></summary>

That’s because a new Predator movie is due out next year, as reported by IndieWire on Twitter. Titled Prey, it’s being directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane director, Dan Trachtenberg, and it will stream on Hulu sometime in 2022. It’s unclear based on IndieWire’s wording if the movie is streaming exclusively on Hulu or if it will simply stream on the service and hit theaters next year.

People Can Fly provides no other hints as to what this update entails. If you’ve enjoyed Outriders and the idea of playing more of it sounds appealing, you’ll need to tune into Square Enix’s Twitch channel this Monday, November 15 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific/12:00 p.m. Eastern.  
Outriders has been relatively quiet the past few months in terms of major updates. Outside of squashing bugs, stabilizing servers, and tinkering with loot drops, People Can Fly has kept any big expansion plans close to the vest until now. The game has felt a bit forgotten as a result despite earning a 9 out of 10 review score from us at launch. Outriders is an entertaining co-op shooter, especially alongside friends, so we’re excited to see what People Can Fly has in store. 
Outriders is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC. The game is also part of Xbox Game Pass on both console and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring is on my mind. When I go to bed and I close my eyes, I see giant crabs clack about. When I see a horse in a field, I think of Torrent the spectral steed. I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.
And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Listen, folks, I'm going to hold up my hands and tell you something shocking. I don't get Dark Souls. I've tried to play FromSoftware's much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I'm simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I've come to realise I simply don't have the time or the patience to see it through. I'm not sure I ever will, either. 
It's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I've fallen hook, line and sinker for Death's Door, the crow reaper sword 'em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

It’s the Dark Phoenix skin, and X-Men fans will recognize her as the Phoenix seen throughout the Dark Phoenix Saga, a run of comics that ran in 1980. You might also recognize Dark Phoenix from the 2019 X-Men movie of the same name. Regardless, if you’re a fan of the more explosive variant of Jean Grey, this skin is for you. 
"I am Fire and Life incarnate! Now and forever - I am Phoenix!"

As you can see in the tweet above, the skin and accompanying items are now available for purchase in the Fortnite Item Shop. Her set features the outfit, the Phoenix Force back bling, and the Rising Phoenix Emote. You’ll also receive the Wrath of the Phoenix Loading Screen with the set as well, according to Epic Games. 
Dark Phoenix joins other skins recently added to Fortnite such as Jinx from League of Legends, which represents the first time a League of Legends character has appeared in a non-Riot franchise, and Naruto, although this was a collaboration tease and we’re still in the dark about what’s actually coming from the Shippuden series. Be sure to check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and Dc superheroes and supervillains in Fornite after that.

Today, you cannot buy it at all on PC. Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

In a rare moment of financial openness, if you will, Nintendo has released some official numbers regarding its October sales of Switch consoles, Metroid Dread, and more. 
In a new interview with The Washington Post, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser revealed that the company sold 711,000 Switch consoles in the U.S. in October. Of those 711,000, Bowser says 314,000 of them were the recently-released OLED model. He also revealed that many of the Switch units sold were bought by people that already owned one and they were upgrading to the OLED or buying another for someone else. 
On the Metroid Dread front, 854,000 copies were sold in October, and Bowser says this is the best Metroid launch in series history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dice has revealed its post-launch plans for the first year of Battlefield 2042 and there’s a lot of content on the way for the multiplayer-only title. 
Battlefield 2042 is out now for those with access to its early access period, and the full title will be out for most on November 19. As you jump into the game, you’ll be treated to a sizeable amount of maps, specialists, weapons, and more, but according to a new blog post from Dice, this is just the beginning. In its first year, you can expect multiple seasons and accompanying battle passes, new specialists, and possibly some new maps.

“In our first year of live service, we will deliver four Seasons, with four Battle Passes, four new Specialists, and new locations along with more fresh content,” Dice’s blog post reads. “We also intend to deliver updates to Battlefield Portal that will give players more ways to build and share new Battlefield experiences with the world.” 
Continuing in the blog, Dice says for Season 1, expect a new Specialist, one Battle Pass, and some additional Portal content. They even tease that players might see some “new sights” (presumably by way of new maps) as the story of 2042 unfolds. More details regarding that will be shared early next year, Dice says. 
“During launch, we’ll also kick off the Preseason with Weekly Missions and Rewards, Limited Time Modes, featured Creator Spotlights and experiences in Battlefield Portal, and more,” the blog post reads. 
While waiting for all of this new content to hit 2042, check out Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review in progress and then check out Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Battlefield 2042. Read about its new Hazard Zone game mode after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.

Reviewed on: Switch
		

The Shin Megami series has always reflected the darkness and cruelty of the world we live in, offering a reminder that the odds are often stacked against us, and unfair circumstances can cause great loss. But it also captures the beauty of rising up against those daunting challenges to stand tall – even when things seem impossible, we somehow persevere. That’s what makes the Shin Megami Tensei franchise shine, but the road to these victorious highs is filled with demoralizing lows. Voluntarily putting your energy into something that requires extra fortitude, commitment, and patience may not seem that appetizing at first glance, but no game has made me feel the rush of victor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

In the end, though, we don't talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by 'Bath's Nic Cage', and discuss the time he turned on Bath's Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week.

It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite things about the Fallout series is learning what weird and wonderful experiments took place in its vaults. There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Battlefield 2042 review-in-progress is an odd one. Namely because my hands-on time with the game has been dictated by EA, as opposed to actual real-life sit-downs with my own copy of the game. Still, I've largely enjoyed what I’ve played so far and am confident that Battlefield fans will too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

I may not have places to go or people to see, but I do have a lot of stuff to do (like the mandatory watching of videos about correct neutral chair posture at work). Then your browser game turns out to be a strange, sort of post-apocalypse thing about music, dancing and weird rural traditions - and harvesting a lot of corn - and I will be crouched on my chair, slavering like a little cider-swilling urchin, for the entirity of those 40 minutes.
Such a creature am I for Peter Talisman: Lord Of The Harvest, a game that fills your screen with a huge field of gently swaying corn.

This same screwtop fuckboi can now be your wingman in Curved Space, a twin-stick shmup of no particular note. "It is the first time a fragrance has featured in a game as a playable character" is a line from the press release. I love it, I hate it.

But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s this hip-hop track I’m a fan of called Money Dance by Rick Ross. It doesn't have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there's one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.
For three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend's PS5 (that I, err, 'borrowed', as sadly Elden Ring's closed network test isn't available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.

Brice said, “I just wanna demystify to a lot of people that you don’t need this intense process to make video games.” While tools like Unity and Game Maker 2 have become more user-friendly over the years, the game making tool with the lowest barrier to entry might just remain Twine - the HTML-based text-centric dev tool that is often likened to a way to make electronic choose-your-own-adventure stories. The freedom presented with Twine has afforded many creators, especially queer game devs, the opportunity to make stunning, often shocking work - with Benji Bright among them.

In Forza Horizon 5, this involves buying janky Jeeps. So many Jeeps. Players have figured out that an endless stream of Willys Jeeps give them a cheap way to get big spins on the prizewheel, potentially winning big money and unlocking rare cars.

And comes with the creeping realisation that your life has as much meaning as can be physically stuffed into a few cardboard boxes.
An extra special high-five, then, to Unpacking, which not only makes this stressful event a delightful puzzle, but also demonstrates that your life and things actually have incredible meaning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The description under the video below says it is being released "in celebration of 10 years" of Star Wars: The Old Republic. Ten years! I'd have sworn it was 9, tops. The video itself is a 4K remaster of The Old Republic's original reveal trailer. If you like the ol' space biff, this is some really high resolution space biff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem with coming Back 4 Blood is that soon you'll want more blood, and more blood. Thankfully, Left 4 Dead creators Turtle Rock have detailed more of the post-launch plans for their new zombie-smashing shooter, laying out the content roadmap for the next few months and into next year. Before paid expansions start rolling in 2022, this year we should expect to see new free stuff including a solo offline mode with progression, a new card type, new cards, and more.

Over the last week or so, the developers have been celebrating the arrival of the show in other games too, with Jinx-themed Valorant skins and even a crossover with Fortnite. The festivities are carrying on this week in League Of Legends and Legends Of Runeterra as well, with new "interactive experiences", game modes and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, here’s a bit of a bum note in the otherwise upbeat tune of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs: the new chips are apparently tripping up games that use Denuvo DRM. Not all of them, fortunately, but Intel has listed over 50 games that might suffer compatibility issues across Windows 10 and Windows 11 when using an Alder Lake processor. These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

Konami have announced that starting today, they plan to temporarily remove MGS2 (and 3, though that's not on PC) from digital stores while they renew licenses for historical footage used in the game. They plan to start selling them again once the licenses are renewed, but that would require Konami successfully accomplishing something, and do you really trust them to do that?

"You cannot be bad at watching a movie. You cannot be bad at listening to an album. But you can be at playing a video game. And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game."
Don't worry; I'm not about to take out a cane and start hammering away at the skeletal, equine remains of the "difficulty in games" debate. But I always remember that joke. I like him miming a book quizzing you on what the major themes of the text are so far, and then woomp-ing closed if you can't answer, and I thought of it again recently while playing Inscryption.

Previously due on the 23rd of November, it's now expected on the 7th of December. Sounds like they need more time to work on stability, though game director Naoki Yoshida's explanation was a little more dramatic, offering his "sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused to our players and colleagues due to my own shortomings."

In 2020, BioWare revealed they were working on a brand new game in the series, but this year they looked back on the Mass Effect trilogy remasters that came out in May. I thought that was all they had in store until the very end of the day when they tweeted a new teaser poster for the next game, featuring a crater shaped like a giant geth head. Geth! Mass Effect trilogy villains! Get your goggles on, reader, it's time to investigate this pic.
