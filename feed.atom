My Time at Evershine, the first confirmed 'Switch 2' game, has smashed its Kickstarter goal with another 23 days to go.
With an initial goal of $200,000 (£149,583), the Kickstarter has raised a total of $1,561,080 (£1,167,556) at the time of writing thanks to the backing of over 17,000 supporters. When the game was initially announced, developer Pathea Games said that it had "plans for release on next-gen Nintendo platforms when they become available".

How to Change Stats in Roblox Sorcery


You need Forgotten Orbs to change stats in Roblox Sorcery. One Orb item allows you to reset stats once, after which the item will disappear from your inventory. Now, you're probably wondering how to obtain Orbs in Sorcery.


How to Get Forgotten Orb in Sorcery


There are three ways to get Forgotten Orbs in Sorcery:



Codes: The easiest way to get Forgotten Orb is to redeem Roblox Sorcery codes. 


Missions: You can also get them as a reward for completing missions.


Trading: Players who don't need Orbs are happy to trade them away for the right price.

Be careful with them, though, as Orbs are items that can be lost if you die. To secure them, visit your bank in a starting location before you head into dangerous areas. There, you can deposit Forgotten Orbs (and other items) and pick them up later.

There's no option on the main screen for stat reset, so you must turn to your inventory. Follow the instructions below on how to use Forgotten Orb to change stats in Sorcery. 



Equip Forgotten Orb.


Click on an item in the inventory or press the hotkey (in my case, it's the "2" key on a keyboard)


Press the Confirm button in the popup to complete the process.


Your stats are now reset.



Now that you know how to reset stats in Sorcery, check out the Sorcery Roblox Cursed Technique Tier List to improve your character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has taken some time, but EA FC 25's Title Update 2 will feel like a gift from the gods for those who are on the consoles. 


If you, like me, play on a console, you'll know exactly what I am talking about. Irrespective of whether you're on an old-gen or current-gen console, the menus feel full of lag. In fact, there have been instances where players have accidentally ended up pressing the wrong buttons, and picked wrong rewards/cards. Thankfully, this issue, along with certain other bugs, will be removed once the second title update goes live. 


EA FC 25 Title Update 2 patch notes


Here's the full set of patch notes for Title Update 2 in EA FC 25. 


General, Audio, and Visual


Addressed the following issues:



Sometimes button inputs were not being registered when performing actions in the menus.


Controller compatibility issues when using Steam Input.


Steam Input now needs to be enabled before launching EA SPORTS FC 25 to have it work as intended.


Stability issue occasionally happening in all Online modes.



Ultimate Team


Addressed the following issues:



Stability issue when accessing Squad Battles.


Addressed instances of stability issues while in the Store.


Unintended UI elements sometimes displaying on the screen.


Adjusted the message that displays when confirming to start an Evolution.



Career


Addressed the following issue:



Addressed instances of stability issues within Manager Career.





It's worth noting that while Title Update 2 will be extremely beneficial for console users, it will be first released on PC. Until the patch goes live on consoles, crossplay will be temporarily disabled for PC users. Hopefully, the upcoming patch will make lives of EA FC 25 players easier, and it will be interesting to find if EA Sports has incorporated any hidden gameplay changes.

Looked for new codes! 




Slimes might seem small and easy to kill, but in Slime Slaying Simulator, you're faced with killing so many in a world packed with them that they'll become the bane of your existence. In these vast worlds, fighting slimes is a noble cause for which you're handsomely rewarded. 


While the game's name might make you think of a cheap knock-off Dragon Quest title, this Roblox game is far from it. In Slime Slaying Simulator, you're taught the basics and then are sent out into the world to kill slimes, earn new gear, and unlock new parts of the world so you can conquer the Slime Queen and many more monstrous enemies. You can even hatch friendly slimes to help tackle the bigger enemies and ensure the world is saved from a sticky, gooey end.

But because it takes time to level up and unlock different moves and cursed techniques, it's best to have a specific build in mind before you start.

Best Shrine Build in Sorcery


Of all curse techniques, weapons, and special abilities, the Shrine build listed below was by far the most powerful in Roblox Sorcery, as it combines critical hits, knockback, and damage. It takes time to unlock everything you need, so use Sorcery codes to speed up the process.

So, until you get Limitless or Shrine, it's often better to stick to something that's easier to get and does the job almost as well. To help you learn which CTs you should avoid and which you should keep, here is our definitive cursed technique tier list for Sorcery Roblox.

Shrine — Shrine is arguably the strongest cursed technique in Sorcery. The damage and range of all its moves are crazy, and it has plenty of AoE in its kit. It literally has no downsides, and it's a base for the best build in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're trying to access the store or go online on your PS4/PS5, there is bad news for you, as the PlayStation Network error continues to cause trouble worldwide.


This is the latest instance of PSN going down in recent times, which will indeed cause a lot of frustration among users. This network-wide outage has been going on for at least a few hours, affecting users all over the world. It's unclear what may have caused the issue, but there are specific steps you could take to alleviate the problems.


Is the PlayStation Network down?


As of writing, the services are still down globally. While PlayStation has officially acknowledged the problem and continues to work, a fix has yet to be rolled out. You can always check the updated status by going to this link. As of writing, it shows up issues in three different areas:



Account Management


Gaming and Social


PlayStation Store





How to fix PlayStation Network error?


The PlayStation network error is entirely caused by issues on the server end. Hence, there's not much that you can do to help your case. That said, here are a few steps you can take to ensure that such network issues aren't caused by problems on your end.



Check the PSN service status website to know about the latest situation.


If it says that the services are online, but you're still getting the error, restart your console.


Always use a wired connection when possible.



Usually, the fix to the latest problem will take only a few more hours to complete, and users should soon be able to access the online services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA FC 25 players on the PlayStation consoles have been locked out of their games for over an hour now, which has caused many issues for those looking to enjoy the online modes.


Unfortunately, the latest issue isn't at the end of EA's servers, as was the case a few days back. Instead, the latest error seems to be a byproduct of PlayStation's failure to remain online. It's unclear when the problem might get fixed, but here are some steps you could try to ensure that there are no problems at your end.


EA FC 25 PlayStation network error explained


The latest error seems to have been caused by a wrong configuration, and there have been occurrences in the past. Thanks to the error, the online service for many video games remains unavailable as of this writing. With EA FC 25, you can still play the offline modes like Career mode. Unfortunately, all online content, including Ultimate Team, remains out of order. If you attempt to sign in and play, you'll get an "Unable to connect" error message.




There's not much you can do apart from wait. When EA's servers go down, it's either due to routine maintenance or when the player count exceeds normal capacity. This time, the issue is entirely different, so you're not seeing a queue to enter Ultimate Team mode.


Complete the following steps to ensure that you can jump right back in once the servers are back online on your PlayStation.



Have an active PlayStation Plus membership, which is essential for online matchmaking.


Try to use a wired connection to prevent and reduce packet loss chances.


Ensure that your PlayStation is updated to the latest firmware available. 



If you tick all these checkboxes, the only other solution for now is to wait. Or, you can give the Manager Career a spin. With all the recent changes made by EA Sports, the mode feels fun on higher in-game difficulties.

Ahead of the release of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake this November, series' creator Yuji Horii has addressed the changes to the female characters in the game, who are now showing less skin than the original version of the game.
Speaking during an interview at the Tokyo Game Show (and translated by Valute News), Horii admits he's just as confused by the changes to the late Akira Toriyama's artwork, but goes on to explain how if there's "too much exposure, the age rating goes up" and it means the game can't be sold to "all-ages".

You face off against Condé’s brother’s imposter at the end of Lanayru Temple, where he’s introduced as Skorchill. He’s perhaps my favorite boss in the game, and I think that’s because the other bosses are a mix of uninteresting and too much effort. Skorchill goes down easy if you know what I’m doing. You’re going to preferably have an Ice Wizzrobe and a Fire Wizzrobe. Ice and Fire Keese can be used instead, but I don’t recommend them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eager for more Deadpool and Wolverine goodness? Then you'll perhaps be happy to learn about the surfacing of a new deleted scene featuring B-15 and Paradox prior to the release of Deadpool and Wolverine on Disney +.






The scene shows a conversation at the Time Variance Authority's headquarters between B-15 and Paradox, who she warns not to do anything, as his job is to do nothing and prevent others from doing anything. The problem is, Paradox is a bit bored of his job and he has, in fact, already done quite some things that he shouldn't have. One such thing, namely, was setting all the events of Deadpool and Wolverine in motion.


Matthew Macfadyen isn't present in Loki, as Paradox was only added to Deadpool and Wolverine likely due to Macfadyen's great turn as Tom Wambsgans in HBO's Succession. The scene does seem to feature a bit of a Succession taste to it, as Macfadyen spills a bit of acidic humor towards his overseer in the TVA (Tive Variance Authority).


Wunmi Mosaku' B-15, Paradox's superior, is largely absent from Deadpool and Wolverine's original cut, a stark contrast to her constant presence in Marvel's Loki. This scene was likely removed because it didn't really add much to the plot, and also to make her reveal at the end of the movie stand out as one of those surprise appearances that Marvel likes to have fans clapping about.


Deadpool and Wolverine will come out on Disney+ Tomorrow, October 1, and will hit 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on October 22.

Should you pull The Shorekeeper in Wuthering Waves?


As always, some nuances must be considered when this question is asked.

Generally, the strategy has always been to target its big, obvious eyeball, but The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom gets a smidge more complicated.


I say “smidge” because the strategy of shooting it in the eyeball is still there. In fact, the quickest way to render the boss vulnerable is to watch for it to open its peeper and put an arrow in there. This only happens while it’s on the wall, and often is just before and after it fires a pretty brutal laser. However, if you manage to land an arrow while its eye is open, it will fall to the ground and be vulnerable to direct attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If, for some reason, you lose an important item, or accidentally delete something from your WoW inventory that you shouldn't have, know that there is a way to recover with a couple of strings attached. Item Restoration is the savior in the situation and using it can be tricky if you aren't aware of the potential mistakes during the process.


How to Restore Items in WoW


Whether you've vendored your main weapon or disenchanted your fabled tier piece, Item Restoration is a failsafe put in place by Blizzard that allows you to restore items that you've unfortunately lost. The process is fairly simplistic to initiate, though there are some key restrictions in place that you must meet the criteria of before you can actually begin it. There'd be no point in me explaining how you can do this wit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A huge update is on the way to Sea of Stars with some oft-requested features in tow. Sabotage Studio has set the free Dawn of Equinox update for a November 12, 2024 launch, introducing local co-op and more on all platforms.


Sabotage detailed the hefty update in a press release, which calls this the studio's "fully realized vision" for the acclaimed RPG. The local co-op, for starters, lets up to three players tackle the adventure in its entirety, mastering timed hits in a co-op environment along the way. 


Combat has been refined significantly along with this addition. Combo Points are now retained after battles, there have been balance updates, and Mystery Locks introduce new ways to break enemy spells. If this makes things too easy or too hard for you — or anywhere in between — new difficult presets are available at the start of a new game. 


New horizons

Beyond quality-of-life improvements and a Quebecois localization, there are a few other major beats worth mentioning. Dawn of Equinox adds a revamped prologue that nixes the flashback structure and directly implements combat for the younger heroes. There's also a brand new cinematic during a pivotal moment for some extra impact. 


Need help finding some of those pesky collectibles and hidden challenges? There's an improved Parrot Relic for that. Finally, a new Speedrunner Mode Relic triggers features that make it easier to keep track of your personal quest to set a world record in Sea of Stars, or at least best your own time. 


Beyond all that, the free Throes of the Watchmaker DLC is due out in spring 2025. When it launches, players will be also able to dig into the new storyline and more with Dawn of Equinox's local co-op.

As spotted by The Hollywood Reporter, we know that the next two comic book personalities to pair up are Bane and Deathstroke. 


The script is by Matthew Horton, who has screenwriting credits on the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World, Marvel's Moon Knight, and who also wrote the screenplay for 2018's Operation Finale — which also starred Oscar Isaac.


We still don't know whether the new Bane and Deathstroke story will be part of James Gunn and Peter Safran's new DCU, or if, like Joker, be its own thing. While we don't have an official word on it, I'm betting it's safe to say it won't be part of the Snyderverse. No one is attached to direct yet, and no plot or cast d…]]></summary>

Echoes of Wisdom delivers multiple first-times for The Legend of Zelda series. Zelda is finally the main playable character in a mainline Zelda title, for instance. But, for the first time ever in the series, one amusing detail about our usual main character, Link, has been given a little bit of an explanation.
Despite only being a playable character briefly in the opening of the game, Link can't actually speak in Echoes of Wisdom. He makes his usual grunts and noises as he does in other Zelda games, which on the surface is totally normal — except he doesn't speak at all. Even if Zelda also only makes noises, she at least speaks because you have dialogue options with her.

Lo Celso becomes the third footballer whose promo RTTK card has been released as part of the challenge. At first glance, the SBC appears to be quite affordable. But affordability isn't the only parameter you should consider about a SBC early on in the game. Let's take a look at whether you should complete this challenge or not. 


EA FC 25 Giovani Lo Celso RTTK SBC tasks


The Giovani Lo Celso RTTK SBC has two separate tasks, and here are their conditions.

Here's a set of solutions that you can use to complete the latest RTTK SBC for cheap in EA FC 25.

Here are the key stats of Lo Celso's RTTK version.

I feel that this SBC should have cheaper requirements. The cost of completing the SBC is a big negative point, because the card itself looks pretty good. Having a playstyle+ would have certainly made him more popular, but Betis has a relatively smooth upgrade path. Unless you need someone with the Shadow Striker or Half-Winger role+, this SBC might not be worth your time.

The latest UK charts data is here and, to our genuine surprise, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sadly didn't nab the top spot this week. Instead, the newly released EA Sports FC 25 has managed to beat the competition to claim the prize.
It's an unfortunate outcome, though hardly a disastrous one. After all, these are just the boxed charts we're talking about here; chances are Nintendo managed to flog a load of copies of Echoes of Wisdom via the Switch eShop. We suspect it will also retain popularity for a good few weeks yet, especially in the run up to Christmas. In a nutshell though, this is more indicative of the insane popularity of football games in the UK than it is of Zelda's commercial performance.

Where to find the Treasure of Daybreak


The Treasure of Daybreak can be found northeast of Vienta Village in the Monolith Wastelands, close to the Sandworm Lair waypoint. If you look at the clue provided in the Treasure of Daybreak exploration tab, you will see a hint that the treasure is near two giant outcroppings with a smaller rock nearby.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard not to fixate on playing as Zelda in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. Link has been the mainstay player character in the series since its inception, barring some smaller moments and the collective hallucinations that were the CDi titles. So, this has been a long time coming.


But it would take more than simply being able to wear a dress to get me excited. Zelda is about as blank-slate as Link. Her personality changes depending on the needs of the game, and most of the time, she still manages to be the most boring person in the room. Thankfully Echoes of Wisdom is more than just a dress-wearer. It instead mixes elements from the series to create something distinct with appropriately mixed results.

In this new video from publisher Dotemu titled 'A New Angle', we get a closer look at Metal Slug Tactics' gameplay and visuals courtesy of the development team. The video contains several interviews with creatives who have worked on the game, each of whom has a tidbit to share about how the title came to be.

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fantasian! DQ3! Phantom Brave! Sonic, again!
With the Nintendo Switch winding down, the Switch successor still unannounced, and Nintendo itself not typically showing games at the Tokyo Game Show, it can be a little hard to find titles you can play on your favourite hybrid handheld console between massive booths for Monster Hunter Wilds and the remake for Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater. However, those who took the time to look would find more than a handful of promising titles. We went ahead and did just that.
Most of them weren’t running on Switch but rather on either a PlayStation 5 or an ultra-powerful PC build; with recent Switch releases struggling with performance, we’ve made sure to mention which ones we didn’t go directly hands-on with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the trailer for steampunk RPG New Arc Line released in April, I was immediately taken in by its premise. To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

Besides needing a very leading-edge software stack to enjoy the Xe2 accelerated graphics out-of-the-box, the performance currently is poor. It's a fraction of the Windows performance and currently falls behind the Meteor Lake graphics performance and in turn also being well behind the AMD RDNA3.5 competition with the Ryzen AI 300 series laptops.]]></summary>

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

Just recently, former professional skateboarder Tony Hawk confirmed that he was "talking to Activision again" in regards to his titular video game franchise. While we could confidently assume that this meant future entries were likely in the works, we now have further confirmation from the Birdman himself via Instagram (thanks, VGC).
Posted in the last 24 hours at the time of writing, Hawk celebrated the 25th anniversary of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, released on 29th September 1999 for the PS1, with an N64 version following soon after. He ended the post with a tantalising tease on a potential new game, stating "I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series; but there will be a future".

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

As we get closer and closer to the official reveal of the Switch successor, a sharp increase in rumours and bold claims is bound to happen. The latest comes from Reddit and precariously straddles the line between plausible and utterly bizarre. It also happens to be a rather old idea; one that we could certainly see come to fruition in the future, but right now..? We're not completely convinced yet.
It's all to do with scroll wheels. Specifically, scroll wheel shoulder buttons. The idea comes from Redditor 'Adjacent-Adjunct', who claims to have held a dummy model of the upcoming 'Switch 2'. They state that the model had no innards of any kind, nor any indication of ports or vents. Hmm... Convenient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A court in Greece has handed down one of the most punishing sentences on record to a man who resold pirate IPTV subscriptions. The Court of Thessaloniki heard that the local man sold subscriptions to thousands of customers, generating millions of euros. After the court sent him to prison for eight years, attention now turns to a seized customer database. The authorities are said to be preparing cases against customers, some of whom have already been arrested.

This time, however, Far Cry 5 director Dan Hay is seemingly at the helm.

Despite having tried my hand at it in the past, namely when the original iteration of it came out on consoles back in 2011, I’d never stuck around to see it through to the end, or even get past a few early bosses. However, in the middle of the summer of 2020,…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bravely he stood, alone on his hill, unwavering in the face of backlash: Chrono Trigger should have just let Frog be a talking frog instead of being a knight turned into a frog. So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called Threads Of Time, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful. Hop on over to the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

It’s a great game, and this sounds like the perfect time to pick it up, especially if you previously pirated it after the devs said they didn’t mind.

He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase.

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

Within an hour of sitting down to play Two Point Museum at Gamescom last month, I was running a modest monthly profit, educating the masses about one-fifth of a dinosaur skeleton, and most importantly, had not ordered a single staff member to their death.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a samurai poised patiently for an opening in their opponent’s defences, Shogun Showdown understands that focus and finesse are the means to delivering an impactful blow. This rare roguelike distils the genre down to its purest components, all in favour of amplifying its dizzying combat that plays gracefully with the concepts of positioning and patience. Highly refined, stylish and complex, Shogun Showdown is a delight.

It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

As a heartless individual, I am more concerned with whatever the dog's capable of: general savagery, a howl that replenishes my HP bar, letting me climb atop its glorious mane as it strides across the barren wastes. If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing a new Soulslike, there’s an element of translation involved while you figure out the language of the game. What are the upgrade materials called? What’s the equivalent of poison? What are experience points and checkpoints called, although you’re going to call them souls and bonfires anyway? I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoilers throughout. TLDR: fun, generous, beautiful animation and cinematography. Worked mostly fine on my PC. I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. 
Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“We have been sold this myth for a very long time that unions have to be for blue collar workers in an industrial setting in the early 1900s,” Autumn Mitchell tells me. “The very simple definition of a union is just you and your co-workers coming together and forming a collective body. You can do that anywhere.”
A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reasonably sure Final Fantasy 16 isn't the longest Final Fantasy I've ever played, but it feels that way, for a multitude of reasons. The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

It's a landscape of wonder and pain, and it's about to get a little more wonderful and painful. The upcoming Watcher expansion, which adds new places to visit and a new type of slugcat to play as, will be coming out early next year, say the developers. There's a trailer to say so. Look at this slippery gastropodal feline, standing calmly in the rain, as if the torrential and lethal weight of the water will not crush that little fuzzy head. The gall!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.
