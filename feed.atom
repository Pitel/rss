The glitch seemed to arrive alongside update 1.12 and will seriously halt your game if you leave your Tarnished alone for too long. 


Steam Deck users noticed an issue that made the game unresponsive to any inputs. FromSoftware took to Twitter/X to confirm that this occurs if you leave the game running but leave your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes. The developer is working on hotfix for the glitch, but it's not here yet. To avoid the issue happening to you, it's important to keep your Tarnished moving.

Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

However, you do have to have advanced pretty far, as you need to kill a late-game boss as part of the pre-requisites. Here is how to access the new area, the Shadow Realm, in the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and where you can find the entrance to the new area.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Where to find the new area in Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC


As long as you have defeated Starscourge Radahn at the Redmane Castle in Caelid, and Mohg, Lord of Blood at Mohgwyn Palace, you are eligible to enter the new Shadow Realm area in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Once you have defeated those two bosses, head to the Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace as indicated in the screenshot above. This is the Site of Grace that was created after defeating Mohg, Lord of Blood. The Cocoon of the Empyrean is also the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree starting point for beginning the DLC content.


At the Cocoon of the Empyrean, you will see an NPC, a follower of Miquella, to be exact. She tells you that her fellow followers are already inside the Shadow Realm, awaiting your arrival. In order to enter the new area, simply interact with the cracked cocoon nearby with a long withered arm hanging out of it. You will then get the prompt asking if you want to "Head to the realm of shadow?" Select YES and you will enter the new Shadow Realm area in the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and begin the expansion.


If you attempt to interact with the cocoon but do not get a prompt to enter, it means you either do not have the DLC activated or you have not killed Starscourge Radahn or Mohg, Lord of Blood. Complete these tasks and you will be able to enter the new Shadow of the Erdtree zone.

One of the early talismans you can acquire in the DLC is Rellana's Cameo, a solid talisman themed around Rellana, the Twin Moon Knight. Here is how to get Rellana's Cameo and how to make the most of the talisman in Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree.

Where to find Rellana's Cameo


You can find the Rellana's Cameo talisman in a church-like structure in the southern part of Castle Ensis. After fighting Moonrithyll, Carian Knight and acquiring her Colossal Sword near the Castle Ensis Checkpoint Site of Grace, head into the church she came from.


Inside the church, you'll find a translucent soul praying to Marika. On the other side of him is an altar, which has loot on it. Pick up this loot to acquire the Rellana's Cameo talisman.


Screenshot by Destructoid


How to use Rellana's Cameo talisman — Is it good?


The Rellana's Cameo talisman enhances attacks executed after maintaining the same stance for a certain length of time. Primarily, this talisman should be used with builds that make use of Power Stancing, which is obtained by dual-wielding two weapons of the same type.


Simply equipping two weapons of the same type (IE two Straight Swords, not two of the same exact weapon, though that would also apply Power Stance) will put you in Power Stance. While Power Stance uses a lot of Stamina, it also increases your damage.


This is why Rellana's Cameo synergizes well with a Power Stance build. Because you are already in Power Stance, and will stay in that stance, you will have even further increased damage from maintaining the same stance for a period of time.

When you've got a lot of electrical equipment to reset and fix, and the last thing you need is a cosmic monster absorbing you into its fleshy mass. 


You'll meet Addair when you're trying to reset the rig's protective relay in Still Wakes the Deep. This is a little while after you've escaped Rennick, but the crawl spaces around the area should give you an indication that you're in for a terrible time for the next 10 minutes or so. First, Finlay will point you to a booth with a single switch to flip. Of course, that was never going to be enough, so she directs you to the generator room. It's a simple enough walk over there, turning off a couple of valves as you go. Bu…]]></summary>

I didn’t understand why it wasn’t more talked about, but that was back when I thought that quality had a correlation with popularity. Oh, how naïve. Now that I’m older I realize that it’s all marketing and maybe sometimes people shouting, which is a form of marketing.


Now I’m going to shout at you about Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection. I’m going to tell you about the overall quality of the collection, but none of that matters. You should play Rocket Knight Adventures, and this is your chance.

But it ain't no Resident Evil, and puzzles are few and not too challenging. But there is a more traditional puzzle in Still Wakes the Deep where you must restart a generator. 


The generator puzzle appears appropriately deep into Still Wakes the Deep. Caz is tasked with delving into the oil derrick's lower depths to restart a generator and return power to the platform sometime after dealing with Muir and Trots. Per the norm, it's not as simple as flipping a switch. Nope, you have to flip several switches. Of course, there's more to it in regard to Caz's task (plus there's that whole thing with the grotesque mutant hunting you down), but figuring out this puzzle is a key…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daniel Radcliffe, known famously for portraying the protagonist in the Harry Potter movies, has shared that he would love to see the final Harry Potter book and the movies being adapted for the upcoming Harry Potter show.


After winning his first Tony award, Radcliffe was asked by People in an interview about which book he’s most excited to see the show adapt. He said, “The last one, I mean, it'll be a while before they get to that, I assume, but that was always one of my favorite of the books and of the films."


For those unfamiliar, the final Harry Potter book was The Deathly Hallows, and its story was split into two movies to end the Harry Potter saga. The reboot series will adapt all seven Harry Potter books from J. K. Rowling. 




Radcliffe is right about the wait, since the show is apparently going to run for 10 years. Moreover, the Harry Potter show adaptation will premiere in 2026 on HBO's Max. Taking that release window into account and time needed to get there, it would be a while.


As for the fans who are hoping for a Daniel Radcliffe cameo in the show, the actor has shut down the idea twice in the past. He previously told E! Online that he does not think there is a cameo for him in the show since the show has to be a “clean break”. The actor also shared with ComicBook in 2023 that he is "very excited to have that torch passed" and feels that there is no need to "physically pass it" with a cameo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jon Hamm, best known for his work in the Mad Men series, has now revealed that he has rejected proposals from Warner Bros several times to be a part of their DC movies to play Green Lantern. Instead, the actor offered himself to Marvel Studios several times to portray a character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.


The actor told The Hollywood Reporter that he “definitely didn’t want to do” a Green Lantern role for DC. While Hamm revealed his eagerness to be a part of the MCU instead, he did not disclose the character in particular. Hamm recalled asking Marvel Studios if they were planning on adopting a certain comic book, and the studio confirmed that they were actually looking into it. The actor is hopeful that the proposal to Marvel Studios might work out.


Jon Hamm also explained that he wants his career to be on the same trajectory as that of Jeff Goldblum, highlighting how he steals the show with his appearances in the Marvel movies. Goldblum has played the role of The Grandmaster in the MCU, who ruled over the planet Sakaar in Thor: Ragnarok.


As for the Green Lantern role, Hamm was referring to the Green Lantern movie that came out in 2011, which eventually starred Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan. However, both DC fans and Reynolds quickly moved on from that movie, with the actor even taking a clever self-dig at his decision to play Green Lantern during the post-credit of Deadpool 2.


Hamm was not a fan of the DC movies back then either. He told GQ back in 2015 that even though the studio came after him “pretty hard for Green Lantern”, he only had a “meh” reaction to offer since he felt that they didn't make the kind of movies he liked to see anymore, apparently.

In the tabletop version of D&D 5th edition, the Oathbreaker class was included in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and intended for villainous NPCs, but the class has caught on with players in a big way. Oathbreakers came late to BG3, but Larian clearly understood what made the class such a hit at the table. Paladins are already massively powerful half-casters that can smite their enemies with glee, but the Oathbreaker subclass adds some undead magic and dark power to the mix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the upcoming Season 4 Reloaded update, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile has a treat for Zombies fans available on both iOS and Android. 


Activision confirmed that Zombie Royal is coming to Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile on June 26, which coincides with the start of Season 4 Reloaded. Zombie Royal is a limited-time game that first appeared in the original Warzone, and then Raven Software remade the mode in the battle royale sequel. 




Warzone 2's iteration of Zombie Royale supported a lobby of 72 players in trios.  When a player gets killed, they turn into a zombie instead of getting sent to the gulag. Zombies are relatively weak but have charged jump, gas grenade, and fury abilities that help take down humans more easily. Human players dropped a syringe of Antivirals upon death; if a Zombie player retrieved two Antivirals, they would be sent back into the map as a human player again. However, if a zombie is killed, they must be redeployed by a human squadmate.


Activision did not specify if the Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile Zombie Royal game mode or if there will be more changes and innovations. There will be a full blog post one week before the mid-season update goes live that will detail the upcoming game mode. If this Zombie Royal is anything like what we have previously seen, it will undoubtedly be one of the most popular game modes in the battle royale. Players universally praised both previous versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Go frequently hosts limited-time events, typically only lasting a day or even one hour. That's why it's crucial to keep track of the game's event schedules, or else you may lose out on an exclusive new team member. To stay updated, here's the current Pokémon Go Community Day schedule for June 2024.


When is the next Community Day in Pokémon Go?


The next Community Day for Pokémon Go launches on June 22, 2024, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time. The adorable Fire Mouse Cyndaquil takes center stage for this celebration, spawning more of this creature in the wilds. Shiny variants may also appear during this time, but unfortunately, they are not always guaranteed.

Once you've captured a Cyndaquil, evolve it to Quilava to get a Typhlosion with a Blast Burn Charged Attack. However, you must do this during the event or two hours after its conclusion to gain this unique Pokémon.


During the active hours of the Community Day in Pokémon Go, you'll be reaping the rewards. Event bonuses include the opportunity to earn double XP and Stardust every time you capture a Pokémon. Lure Modules and Incense will be extended to a generous three hours, giving you ample time to make the most of the event. Plus, Niantic has a special surprise in store for those who take a few snapshots during Community Day.


Cyndaquil's Community Day also offers an exclusive Special Research story for one US dollar. But if you want to save some cash, this Pokémon will have its own Field Research tasks for even more challenges.


As for the rest of the schedule, Niantic has confirmed other Community Days for the following months. Specifically, you can look forward to a Community Day on July 31 and August 31. The Pokémon for these events haven't been mentioned yet, so we'll be sure to update this guide once we have more information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Limited Run Games announced as part of their LRG3 stream that they will be localizing Assault Suit Leynos 2 for the first time in North America. This looks like they’ll be publishing a translated version of Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute, which released in Japan earlier this year.


Assault Suit Leynos 2 is the third game in the Assault Suit series. In the West, we’d remember the first two games as Target Earth and Cybernator, but were actually Assault Suit Leynos and Assault Suits Valken, respectively. It’s part of a series of sci-fi mech games. I’ve talked about Cybernator/Assault Suits Valken about a jillion times here on Destructoid. The series has seen something of a Western resurgence.


While Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute is largely a port of the Sega Saturn version of the game, quality-of-life features have been added, such as saving, loading, a rewinding. There are also option difficulty adjustments.


More importantly, we never got Leynos 2 in English. Our Assault Suit collection has been incomplete. This will bring us one step closer. Then the only thing missing is Assault Suits Valken 2, which is weirdly very similar to the Front Mission series. But then, Front Mission: Gun Hazard is extremely similar to Assault Suits Valken (because most of the staff is the same). So really, they were just returning the favor.


But seriously, somebody translate and re-release Valken 2.


Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute is out in North America sometime later in 2024. It’s coming to PS4, PS5, and Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Games Made in Germany Steam Festival, supported by B2B Magazine GamesMarkt, developer Ion Lands has finally revealed the release date for Novalis. The game will be available in Spring 2025, allowing fans to return to the city first seen in Cloudpunk. 


Nivalis is a cozy cyberpunk slice-of-life game in which you set up and run a restaurant for the citizens living out their lives in the titular city, decorate apartments, make friends and enemies, find love, and even go fishing. The game is a surprising follow up to the narrative delivery driving game Cloudpunk, but one that looks to delve deeper into what is arguably the second main character of that game. The city you explore itself.

Of all the seasons to release so far, Monopoly Games has the most number of albums, with 23 regular sets and five prestige variations. Fortunately, Scopely knows how daunting a task card-collecting is and has come out the gate revealing that four- and five-star sticker drop rates are higher this season.


In the initial announcement posts for the Monopoly Games season from Scopely, we learn more about the differences between this season and previous ones. Alongside Monopoly Games being longer than previous seasons, lasting nearly 100 days, we have better chances of receiving four and five-star stickers.

We got to go hands-on with a preview version of Aurora recently, as part of a look at what's next for League of Legends. While you could probably take Aurora into the top lane or even the jungle, she seems best-suited to the middle lane, where her spirit powers and skillshots can do some damage.


Aurora is a vastaya able to see into, and move through, the spirit realm. Her whole vibe is about helping troubled spirits, and she's also unique in representing an autistic character within League of Legends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madden 25's new BOOM Tech system introduces physics-based tackling, improved ball carrier mechanics, and new catching and pre-play features. 


In the first Madden 25 blog, EA provided a deep dive into BOOM Tech, which has been two years in the making. To start, BOOM Tech offers realistic control with every tackle, meaning players can punish ball carriers with devastating hit sticks or fly past offensive linemen with new truck, dive, and stiff arm animations. In addition, the new data-driven physics take into account timing, weight, speed, strength, and player ratings in one-on-one ball plays. The new hit stick makes it possible to tackle ball carriers harder than ever before based on the angle of impact, stick-skill, and accuracy of the cut sticks, big hits, and trucks.

Players will feel the tackles as if they were on the field themselves thanks to the new sound effects and controller rumble hactics when a crunching tackle connects just right. Offense also gets an overhaul thanks to Boom Tech. A new ball carrier balance and recovery system makes it easier for running backs to counter the hit stick, break a tackle, and recover their balance before going down. 


As for when players can try out the new BOOM Tech system for the first time, Madden 25 launches on August 16.

Roblox has built itself up on the efforts of developers, and Epic has been pushing Fortnite Creative with its own internal studios. But for League of Legends maker Riot Games, it seems like the company isn't interested in its MOBA doing the same.


We attended a recent press event held by Riot Games, and got the opportunity to ask League leadership a few questions about the future of the game. Riot Games has already seen one big success in creating a game-within-a-game in Teamfight Tactics, so we asked if Riot would ever be interested in exploring UGC, outside the realm of its MOBA.

So that you can find it on your first try, here's in which chest the Ultimate Prize is located on Wuthering Waves.

Firefly is a Fire Destruction character whose main role in a party is to deal massive amounts of damage. As a Destruction character, she excels in Blast-heavy scenarios (fights with three or fewer enemies), but she is very capable of dealing with everything the game has to offer... with a big catch. More on that later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the LRG3 stream, Limited Run Games revealed that they’re pulling the two Fighting Force games together for a compilation. It will be arriving sometime in 2024.


Do you remember Fighting Force? The first one was released in 1997. Reportedly, Core Design pitched it to Sega for the Saturn as Streets of Rage 3D. Sega passed on it. As a result, it didn’t even release for the Saturn, instead arriving on PS1 and N64.




It’s fun. It’s pretty loose. I don’t think anyone really had a good idea of how to do beat-’em-ups in 3D at the time, and this was no exception. Beyond just fisticuffs, there were also a lot of firearms. Honestly, I think what makes it stick out in my mind so much is its general vibe. There’s a real urban feel to its aesthetic that I love. The weirdest thing about it was that players had lives and limited continues, if I recall. Kind of a drag.


Fighting Force 2 followed on PS1 and Dreamcast. I’m less familiar with this one because I had an N64 growing up. I’ve nearly bought the Dreamcast version on quite a few occasions in the last couple years. Contrary to the first game, the only footage I’ve seen of it takes place in some military complex. It’s also 1-player, what the hell? There’s no word if it’s the PS1 or Dreamcast version (or both) included in the collection. By the looks of it, it’s PS1.


I’m down. They’re admittedly not great games, but I have enough affection for the era. I guess I’m saying that I really want to like them and am willing to attempt it again.


Fighting Force Collection is coming sometime in 2025.

If you've been following the development of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond since its initial announcement in 2017, then chances are you've heard the name 'Sylux' mentioned in passing along the way.
If you're not completely up-to-date on your Metroid Prime history (and not everyone is, that's okay), then you might not know who this enigmatic bounty hunter is. Given that it shows up at the end of the latest gameplay trailer for Beyond, however, it's clear that Sylux is due to play a pretty prominent role in Retro Studio's upcoming FPS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive." 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by "Project Phoenix", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a "visual prototype" for a brand new Red Faction game.

With that in mind, there may have been some details that might have passed you by; little nuggets of information or easter eggs that could provide some vital context to the new game ahead of its release in 2025. Thankfully, then, the lovely Alex Olney is here to walk us through the new trailer and point out everything that you might have missed.

Right at the beginning of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, ‘adventure’ is a bit of a dirty word.
When the wizard Gandalf first meets the timid Bilbo Baggins, a comfort-loving, tobacco-smoking Hobbit, he asks, “I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it’s very difficult to find anyone.” Bilbo’s reply?

It also allows you to summon your Spectral Steed during the game's final fight (which, if you've beaten that boss, you know how helpful your mount would have been during it). 
The patch – V1.12 – is now live on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam) and also features hundreds of other changes, like adjustments to weapons, skills, armaments, and general balance-related things. 
The highlight of the patch is all of the new features it adds to Elden Ring, and you can check those out below:

Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the 'default' option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

Roguelikes won't guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They're more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat's hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it's a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right. Next time you'll find the right pair of poison-proof loafers, the perfect co-pilot for your spaceship, a stash of stronger, better ropes. Next time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to be the very best, like no one ever was?
These days, roguelites and deckbuilders are a dime a dozen, but it seems like developers are finding ways to get creative with the genre mechanics to produce something that sticks out from the glut of releases these past several years. Dicefolk offers one such creative take on the roguelite formula, mixing in a dash of Pokémon-esque monster catching as part of its unique approach. Those who love deckbuilders will find tons to appreciate here, as it builds around an addictive and strategically in-depth combat system that’ll keep you constantly coming back for one more run.
Dicefolk's story is pretty basic. A girl named Alea, a member of the titular folk, discovers she can use her powers to tame and befriend powerful creatures called chimeras which roam the land. Using this newfound ability, Alea sets out on a quest to battle an evil wizard who was sealed away years ago, hoping to stymie his dark influence and bring peace to the world. Those of you looking for a lot of narrative elements in a roguelite may be disappointed at the relatively thin worldbuilding and plot here, but we didn't feel that the lack of a strong storyline took away much from the core monster battling.

Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough.

Over the last few years, as more and more time passed with barely a whisper from Nintendo or Retro Studios regarding Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, many fans had begun to ask the same question: will it skip the Switch and launch on 'Switch 2'?
After all, the game's eventual revival during the latest Nintendo Direct came after the firm had finally acknowledged the Switch's successor, confirming that it would be revealed within the next financial year. So many had come to the conclusion that if Prime 4 doesn't feature in the showcase, then chances are it isn't heading for the Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game's protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.
Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. "It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece," he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.

Switch Online's N64 library didn't get off to the best start, with select games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time filled with a bunch of emulation issues. Nintendo rolled out updates for the app in response to this and since then the situation has somewhat improved.
Unfortunately, it seems one of the latest releases for the service is reportedly in a rough state at launch. The Switch Online emulation of Rare's famous first-person shooter Perfect Dark supposedly has a whole range of "problems", according to well-known GoldenEye 007 enthusiast 'Graslu00', who previously lifted the lid on the cancelled Xbox 360 title.

What is Banana? It's a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there," Iizuka says. "Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They're very popular and dynamic characters."

Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it's not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic's abilities, but we've seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…]]></summary>

The otherwise fantastic cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a barrage of technical problems at launch, as the MMO’s servers buckled under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

Developer Cococucumber has established itself as a dependable indie studio over the past few years. Specialising in accessible throwbacks, it adds a fresh spin on old genre formats. Although its latest title Ravenlok is (pun intended) locked away behind Xbox exclusivity, Switch owners can finally try the second in the dev's self-styled ‘Voxel Trilogy’ - Echo Generation.
A nostalgic and charmingly funny adventure/RPG hybrid, it takes the beautiful voxel style of the developer's 2019 title Riverbond, and applies it to the bizarre summer holiday of a group of suburban kids. Tipping a hat to the point-and-click classics of Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer, there's also more than a little reminder of EarthBound in its creepy view of suburbia.

The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

There are shadows, technically, but they’re so mellow and fuzzy they might as well be stray pools of sunlight that have forgotten to glow. In this latest chunk of Lord Of The Rings memorabilia from developers Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division, you are a custom-created hobbit who has just taken up residence in the charming Tellytubby town of Bywater, there to spend your days foraging, fishing, feasting and fraternizing with your fellow halfings, all of whom wear expressions of rosy-cheeked humour so intense in their winsome affability that your own face soon forms a merry rictus in response - like that terrible smile from Disco Elysium, but cosy. Oh god, no. Oh god, get it off me.

A warrant was executed at a flat in Nottingham where a 42-year-old was detained on suspicion of offenses related to the provision of pirated Sky broadcasts. For deterrent purposes, both the police and Sky want reports like this to reach the public, and that is being achieved. The response, however, is one of almost universal criticism, on grounds that in many cases have little or nothing to do with piracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I wrote our Still Wakes The Deep review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. "Gobshite" became "bastard". The "polis" were localised as the "police". And every "yersel" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became "yourself". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to "International English" for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There's another option, says one of the game's developers.

And it's by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there's one thing that really gets me going, it's a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form.

It's a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don't talk about their sacrifices enough. It's out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020's Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I've got a trailer's worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

It'll land on November 14th. "Waitaminute," you might be saying, "Shouldn't they remake the first two games beforehand?" No, you numpty, you nyaff, you roaster; within the internal chronology of Dragon Quest, 3 comes first.

Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …]]></summary>

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. "Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too," notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. "So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts. It is… a lot. It's too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new "hand-drawn character visuals" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.]]></summary>

Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In addition to the critically acclaimed Street Fighter 6, which arrived last year, Capcom has been mining its fighting game history with various collections. While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today's announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994's X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-'em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more. 
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrives physically and digitally on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she's become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create "echoes" of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Shadow Of The Erdtree about to launch this week, From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has been doing a round of interviews discussing next steps for the venerated action-RPG developer, or at least, hinting at them in the manner of a Dark Souls NPC suggesting that you might want to have a poke around New Anor Londo. In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the "themes or core elements" of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a "short-term way", by the experience of having a daughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Illusion Island was one of our favorite platformers from last year, thanks to its charming visuals, engaging combat-free design, and toe-tapping soundtrack. If you haven't checked it out yet, today is a great day to do so, thanks to the free update that adds a brand-new chapter of gameplay.
Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth's greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.
You can return to the land of Monoth to snoop and sleuth when the Mystery In Monoth update drops later today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.
Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, "It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it".
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.]]></summary>

Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn't that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there's a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You forgot about Habbo Hotel, didn't you? Habbo Hotel. With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. "Habbo Hotel is back!" is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the "same" money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a forum post, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.]]></summary>

For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion's content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you're worried about spoilers and don't plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you'll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. 
But if you don't care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

Monster Hunter is known for its protagonists overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds in their pursuit of taking down the massive monsters that populate the region, but with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom may be taking it to a whole new level. While at Summer Game Fest Play Days, I took in an extended gameplay demo involving an Alpha Monster hunt. I left the demo excited to dive into this seemingly improved take on what the very popular Monster Hunter World delivered in 2018.
Monster Hunter World served as Capcom's big push into making a more mainstream and globally appealing entry in the franchise. The team work…]]></summary>

Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of exactly the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.

I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It's an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer has shut down Pieces Interactive, the developer of the Alone in the Dark reimagining that arrived earlier this year. The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. 
Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.]]></summary>

The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.

June 17, 2024
With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company's fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it's likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. 
With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-17T14:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.
The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. 


Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). 
Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. 
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which "only" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more "intimate", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beloved friends, hated enemies - last week, we let the side down. Due to a shortage of hands at the pump and persistent clouds of Geoff Keighley activity, there was no weekly Maw liveblog, and this has bred disaster.

Hated friends, beloved enemies - I am very sad to say that the proud nation of Dimplexland is no more.

The work, based on Chinese mythology and Buddhist folklore, follows a monk who meets a spirit called Sun Wukong, often called Monkey King, during his search for sacred religious texts. While its central narrative is still unknown, Game Science’s upcoming Soulslike depicts Wukong’s encounters with Yaoguai, various creatures and demons in Chinese myth, set within stunning Eastern landscapes…]]></summary>

Books obviously come in many different sizes, but did you know that there’s an obscure law that dictates the legal limit for how long a novel can be? It’s measured in ‘George Martins’. If your story is more than three ‘Georges’ wide, you’re swiftly escorted to a cell and made to eat any bits of book that reference more than three characters in a scene with the same surname.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. 
The studio also states, “We're committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn't just another sequel - it's a bold new adventure that will la…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’ve been a ton of Jackbox Party Packs over the last near-decade, each following a fairly similar structure: one or two standout games you’ll want to replay, a couple you might dip into every now and then, and at least one you’ll try once and then never bother with again. With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

And, yes, nobody really knows why Bloodborne isn’t on PC yet, almost a decade after it released on PlayStation 4 - despite Sony’s apparent delight in bringing every other PlayStation exclusive to PC, just to mock us. It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often in the ignoble craft of james gournalism you stumble on a game that reminds you why you got into this weird and silly trade, a game that slices through the phantasmagorical mulch of a million Summer Game Fest announcements and clears the portals of the brain. It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there's no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy's "Find Your Way" music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year's Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
"Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct," the Dual Rulers announcement reads. "Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer."

        <updated>2024-06-14T12:40:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi "Suda51" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.
Alongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. 
Plus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has "auto rock on," an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. 
Check all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: 


Lollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as Kingdom Hearts has come to Steam. The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.

It's set in a 1920s boarding school, where you can expect "tuition in Latin, Geometry and a wide range of team sports, all within the beautiful setting of our isolated country estate". Also some murders, possibly.

After 10 years of storytelling, the overarching saga that was introduced in the original launch of Destiny has finally concluded. With The Final Shape, Bungie ties a bow on the vast majority of its lingering plotlines and questions and sets the stage for a new direction in subsequent releases. Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before. From narrative to gameplay, this is not the installment that welcom…]]></summary>

When I first played Astro's Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game's short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive. But after going hands-on with Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel from Team Asobi, I can …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. 
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). 
Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:
Sea of Thieves
Madden NFL 24
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III
Helldivers 2
NBA 2K24
MLB The Show 24
Stellar Blade
Fallout 4
Who’s Your Daddy?!
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
Grounded
Another Crab’s Treasure
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
NHL 24
Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game
Rise of the Ronin
Assassin’s Creed Mirage
WWE 2K24
Elden Ring
For more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch. You can read that retrospective here.

Growing up, I didn't spend much time watching anime outside of the Pokémon animated series after school each day. However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn't an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …]]></summary>

Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma.

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!]]></summary>

It’s from Antistatic Studios, who include former Cyberpunk 2077, Bioshock, and Borderlands devs among their ranks. The FPS lets you and up to three great mates fill the ectoplasm-stained tactical boots worn by members of the ‘paranormal SWAT’, where you’ll explore large maps and try to contain strange goings on. You’ll need to join the game’s Discord if you want to play. Trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mental Salvo describes itself as having an "infinite open world" in which you can do so many things, "they're impossible to list". Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

As if the unholy swarm of trailers and game announcements from Summer Game Fest was not enough, this week the fearful megalords at Valve decided to drop their regular cavalcade of coming-soons onto their megastore. The beautiful (and terrifying) thing about Next Fest, of course, is the overwhelming number of demos that come out during the event. A small herd of video games are standing on my toes as we speak. But that's okay, we are expert curators. Here's a handy list of our nine favourite demos of the lot.

I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.

In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

The list expanded recently with Romslab, a site that offers links to pirated games and emulators such as Yuzu and Ryujinx. Official records redact the name of the game company that requested the blockade, but several signs point in the direction of a 135-year-old Japanese corporation.

If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.
