        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an interview with Famitsu, Nintendo Producer Eiji Aonuma, and Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi confirmed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will not be receiving any new content or DLC. Genki_JPN on Twitter translated the interview:
"We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world," Aonuma told Famitsu. "This time, the reason we decided to make a sequel to the previous game in the first place was because we thought it would be worth experiencing new ways to play in Hyrule. If such reasons arise then we may return to the same world. Whether it is a sequel or new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play, so I hope you will look forward to it. We are very grateful that so many customers have been playing Tears of the Kingdom for so long and deeply, so we will to do our best to make the next title even more enjoyable."

Honestly, it's no surprise that Nintendo feels Tears of the Kingdom is essentially finished. After all, our very own Chris Carter gave the sequel a 10/10 when it was released on May 12, 2023. In comparison, Breath of the Wild only received one expansion pass that included three DLC packs. While the DLC packs were good, they weren't quite on par with BotW itself.
Zelda fans have reason to rejoice, though. Based on the interview, it seems like Nintendo is opting to jump right into the next Zelda title. Maybe going this route we won't have to wait five years for the next one! With the Switch successor reportedly planned for 2024, the time may be better spent working wit the new dev kits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision announced it's adding popular Spyro the Dragon villain Ripto to Crash Team Rumble's Season 2 line-up. New maps and modes will coincide with the character's entry into the game. There's no word of Spyro making the roster as of yet. However, the purple dragon's 25th anniversary looms later this month.
Ripto will be the first Spyro the Dragon character to join the multiplayer game Crash Team Rumble. On September 12, Season 2 of the competitive multiplayer game will include a new mode called Party Mode (which has mini-games) and additional maps such as Waste Deep. The map is inspired by the level Cortex Castle from Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. A Halloween event is likely to occur as well as there's candy with a Jack-o-Lantern's face on it (via CanadianGuyEh) in the official Season 2 picture.
[caption id="attachment_402353" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image via the Crash Bandicoot Twitter[/caption]
Many expected the protagonist, Spyro the Dragon, to be first in line for the party game. He has appeared in Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled as a playable character in the past. There's no confirmation of Spyro's introduction to Crash Team Rumble yet, but it seems to be only a matter of time in fans' eyes. Regardless, it's exciting for many to have Ripto in Crash Team Rumble. 
Ripto is the main villain from 1999's Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage. He's a dinosaur who craves power and will take it by any means. He also utilizes magic as part of his arsenal, like fire and poisonous attacks.
Spyro the Dragon recently hit a big sales milestone as his 25th anniversary draws near. The Spyro Reignited Trilogy, which has the original trio of games remade, has sold over 10 million copies since 2018. At the time of writing, you can buy the game for 75% off on Steam. The offer ends on September 11.

And, alas, it’s just a bit much for the Steam Deck to handle unless you’re happy to sacrifice visual fidelity, framerate or - in most cases - both if you plan on spending your time doing anything except browsing menus (though there’ll be plenty of that).

        <updated>2023-09-06T16:42:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Pokemon Presents that premiered August 8, the Pokemon Company announced a new animated miniseries set in Paldea entitled Pokemon: Paldean Winds. And now, the first episode of Paldean Winds has been released for free via the official Pokemon channel on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyMxQl-PeJE
The episode, which is entitled “Breathe Out,” clocks in at around 11 minutes in length and follows Ohara, a student at Naranja Academy. Ohara is a flutist who has been asked to create a video project celebrating the school’s legacy with fellow students Aliquis and Hohma. But, due to a staggering amount of pressure, Ohara journeys to Glaceado Mountain with her loyal Fuecoco companion in search of her treasure.
The series will have a total of four episodes and is produced by WIT STUDIO, who eagle-eyed anime fans will recognize as the team behind the first three seasons of Attack on Titan as well as one of the studios behind the smash hit SPY x FAMILY. In the Pokemon world, WIT STUDIO also produced the three-episode miniseries, Pokemon: Hisuian Snow.
I’d hate to spoil the episode too severely, but given it’s already dubbed into English, we now have official voices for several characters from Scarlet and Violet: Nemona, Arven, and Clavell. Nemona is voiced by Olivia Vidas, Arven by Henry Mason, and Clavell is voiced by Pete Zarustica. In terms of main cast, Ohara is voiced by Cat Protano, Aliquis by Paul Castro Jr., and Hohma by Caroline Spinola.
If you’d like to get on-board the Paldean Winds train while it’s still early, the first episode is available for free via YouTube. That is, presumably, where the remaining three episodes will be posted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s probably not all that controversial to say that Baldur’s Gate 3 is one of 2023’s best games. Between a varied cast of lovable characters and an amazing story with great depth, it is a wonderful RPG that's one of the best in years. But until this week, it was only on PC. That makes its extreme popularity impressive on its own, but many console players were no doubt feeling left out. With the PS5 version of Baldur's Gate 3 out, players stuck on that platform now have a means to venture across the Sword Coast.
I’ve been a big fan of Baldur’s Gate 3, putting in about 170 hours in the PC version, including going mad in its Tactician difficulty. Before that, I finished a couple of campaigns and put a decent amount of time into the Early Access version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am wholly unsure what it is about the internet and Thomas the Tank Engine, but I absolutely love it. From the == brief meme-ry of Choo-Choo Charles to every new game getting a mod where you play as the iconic children’s character. 
It would appear the recently released Armored Core VI is no exception to that, as a user on NexusMods has released a mod entitled “Thomas the Tank Engine Wheelchair Swap.” And, speaking unironically, it doesn’t even look that bad. 
“Thomas the Tank Engine Wheelchair Swap,” created by NexusMods user ScrubMilk, is meant to replace “the EL-TL-11 FORTALEZA legs with Thomas the Tank Engine,” according to the original post. But users who want a pristine, unparalleled mod experience might want to look elsewhere, as ScrubMilk makes it abundantly clear this is nothing but a fun, silly meme mod for laughs.
How to install mods in Armored Core VI
If we haven’t lost you yet, and you’d like to install the Thomas the Tank Engine mod for your next Armored Core VI run, look no further. While those familiar with Nexus may use its automated install option, Vortex, that's not a route you can take here. Instead, you'll need to manually adjust or use another third-party program, Mod Engine. 
According to ScrubMilk, this mod can be installed using Mod Engine 2.1, which makes it remarkably easy to install the mod into your instance of Armored Core VI. Download the mod from NexusMods, unzip it, and then drop the folder labeled “parts” into Mod Engine’s “mod" directory. You can then launch the mod by running the file named “launchmod_armoredcore6.bat.”
While plenty of mods are all tongue-in-cheek, recent AAA releases are popping off with user-generated content. Games like Starfield have already hosted their own thriving collections, including handy tweaks like a free DLSS3 mod. Baldur's Gate 3 also joins that list with several fan additions that streamline some in-game systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You mean to tell me this comes AFTER BOTW?!
There is a certain beauty to the chaotic ordering of the Zelda timeline. Ever since the 'official' rundown first appeared in the Hyrule Historia, theories have popped up all over the place to either prove or disprove its legitimacy. It's not surprising that Tears of the Kingdom would raise even more questions than it answered, but what would the game's director have to say about its chronological positioning? Expectedly, not much.
In a recent interview with Famitsu, Hidemaro Fujibayashi was asked to comment on this very topic. Unsurprisingly, the director's answer was somewhat vague and only confirmed the fact that the game comes directly after Breath of the Wild (we know, what a shock!), though he could offer nothing more precise in his response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space. The medium frontier. These are the voyages of me, reviewing Bethesda's big space RPG Starfield. It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

Years ago I met Charles Martinet at E3. We shot a quick video where I said "It's a-you?" and he shrieked "It's a-me!" in the voice. I was so taken aback that I said "Holy Sh*t!" - He immediately took me aside and asked me not to post the video, as it would be inappropriate for children. We ended up posting it anyway, with my swear bleeped out, and it was a cute, hopefully inoffensive bit of fun. But what I really took away from that moment is how much Charles Martinet cares about his fans. He wants to fill their hearts with hope and joy, and not whatever the opposite of those two things is. That may be why we still haven't heard exactly why he's no longer the voice of Mario in the games.

While you're shaking the Joy-Con to the beat, you're staring at a monkey's creepy smile playing his maracas. It's unsettling, but overall, this game provides a thrilling rhythm-based challenge with a selection of decent songs. It's just a shame that the game's Latin-inspired routes take a backseat to a poppier soundtrack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It may not be perfectly timed with the film's release, but a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem game is in the works. Outright Games announced plans to launch what is essentially a sequel to the theatrical outing sometime in 2024. Specific platforms haven't been revealed yet, but look for the Mutant Mayhem game to make its way to consoles and PC. 
According to the announcement (via Gematsu), Outright Games is looking to match the film's "bold, painterly art style" with its visuals. As for its sequel status, this one will be set months after the events of the film, so we'll get to see what the heroes in a half shell get up to next. This will, at the very least, involve saving New York City from a new mutant threat. Mutants gotta stop messin' with NYC, man. 
BIG APPLE, 3 AM
Everything else we can expect from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem game is anyone's guess. Outright Games has a history with licensed Nickelodeon games, from Star Trek Prodigy: Supernova to the upcoming PAW Patrol World. At the very least, both Outright and Paramount are aware of how important the film's aesthetic is to its success. As Paramount senior vice president of games and emerging media Doug Rosen noted, "The vibrancy of this new film's animation lends itself perfectly to video games."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem opened on August 2, 2023. The Jeff Rowe-directed film has proven to be profitable (before merchandise is taken into account), netting over $152 million at the global box office. Hopefully whatever Outright Games is cooking up can match its idiosyncratic flavor. It has some tough and similarly nostalgic acts to follow!

Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has garnered critical acclaim since its release in theaters last month. As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. 
Publisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.
In terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. 
The TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tilting Point has revealed Cypher 007, a new top-down action game starring James Bond, coming to Apple Arcade on iOS devices later this month. It launches on September 29 and takes players into "The Mind Trap." 
Because it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. 
Check out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond," the game's description reads. "This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program." 
Because it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. 

Cypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.]]></summary>

It’s chock full of adventure, romance, and creative shenanigans that take multiple playthroughs to experience fully. But what if you’ve got dinner in the microwave and only have a few minutes?
Well, if you’re like Mae or ImTaiyl, you can beat Baldur’s Gate 3 in less than four minutes (not counting loading time) using a technique known as “Shadowboxing.”

What is Shadowboxing?
In Baldur’s Gate 3, you can typically only throw objects a certain distance from you. If you try to throw an object to an invalid location, the game simply won’t let you and the object will stay at its original position. However, the game will store the location you tried to move the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The time has come, it would seem, for Bethesda to rid Doom Eternal of one of its biggest faults: the infamous Denuvo DRM. Having launched in March of 2020, Doom Eternal featured one of the most tone-deaf implementations of Denuvo yet, hyping the DRM up as a "feature" via official channels. Subsequently, there was some amount of backpedaling from id Software on the topic with a temporary removal of the DRM, but Denuvo did eventually come back into the picture due to the game's multiplayer mode. Now, three years following that particular series of stumbles, Doom Eternal no longer appears to have Denuvo on board.
This information comes from SteamDB, as highlighted by the community over at the r/Games subreddit. Bethesda itself didn't announce the change or make a fuss of it in any way, shape,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is officially Starfield Day. Those who have been paying even the slightest bit of attention will have seen the sheer amount of mods that have been coming out even before Bethesda's new game was properly released. Now there's one available that's very much for those who don't want the grind.
Over on Nexus Mods, user ADITYAPAT86 has created and uploaded a very simple script for Starfield that saves all that levelling-up nonsense. By installing this mod, you'll be granted every single perk in the game, as well as having your character's level set to 328.
[caption id="attachment_402243" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Bethesda/Steam.[/caption]
Now, while it does say that this mod maxes out your level, some of you will be quick to point out that Starfield apparently doesn't have a level cap. Still, being bumped up to 328 without doing anything is definitely a leap!
All Starfield but without all that work
You might question why someone would want to skip past all the necessary work needed to advance in a role-playing game, but that's the modding community for you. Already we're seeing hundreds of custom mods for Starfield coming out in quick succession. More are definitely on the way, especially now that the game is out fully.
Very much like it has been with Skyrim, there are going to be so many people who won't want to play the vanilla version of Bethesda's space-faring RPG. Perish the thought! With that in mind, it's only a matter of time until someone blends the sci-fi aesthetic of Starfield with the fantasy lore of The Elder Scrolls. Quick, write that down!

I compare this project, which seemed pretty much doomed at the time, with the globe-straddling free-to-play battle royale/concert venue/art gallery/Olympic sport/all-swallowing multiverse Fortnite has become, and I feel extremely old. My sense of time's crushing burden is not alleviated for learning that Epic are staffing up for work on "a new experience in the Fortnite ecosystem", which sounds a lot like a Fortnite open worlder. What fresh hell is this, Epic? When will enough be enough?

2023 has been quite the time to be a TMNT fan and it looks like next year will be no different as Outright Games has today announced that it will be releasing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem game inspired by the recent film.
The information that we have on the as-yet-untitled game is somewhat limited, though we do know that it will be set shortly after the events of the movie and is set to have the same cartoon-y visual style that made the film such a hit. This one is set to release at some point in 2024, so we have a bit of time before we'll need our nunchucks at the ready.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's tough to make a name for yourself in the video game world, especially on platforms like Steam. Countless studios are vying for your attention (and money), but recent data shows that if you use certain words in your game's title, you might have a bit of an edge.
That's according to the latest newsletter from GameDiscoverCo (as spotted by PCGamer), a website that chronicles "how people discover and buy video games." It seems as though there's a correlation between certain words used and revenue generated. For example: Steam games that feature the word "HD" or "manager" earn a median revenue of around $63,000 and $33,000, respectively.
[caption id="attachment_402213" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via GameDiscoverCo.[/caption]
Perhaps unsurprisingly in this era, "remastered" yields an average of £32,000 income, while "gold" and "pro" can earn your game around $11,000 and $16,000, respectively.
That explains why the Tycoon series is so popular
The study contains a list of over 200 words that are used in Steam game titles. A breakdown from GameDiscoverCo reveals some interesting facts about these findings. For example: the median average across the board is "worryingly low." However, this is almost certainly due to how popular and busy Steam is.
Adaptations tend to generate more revenue, so the aforementioned "HD," "remastered," "pro," and "gold" seem more likely to do well than games that have words like "ball," "maze," or "jump" in them. This may be due to them being more simple or generic words.
The analysis also looked at how frequently words cropped up in games. What you'll see from the above graph is just how many studios want to put the word "dead" into their titles.
Something to think about if you're looking to release your next Steam game: Dead Manager: The Ultimate Tycoon Pro (HD, Remastered)

One player by the name of Poly-Knight recently took to the r/HollowKnight Reddit forum to share their incredible project: converting the game's Mantis Lords boss battle into 3D. Now, we adore Hollow Knight's 2D visuals and wouldn't want to have seen Team Cherry do it any other way, but as an exercise in improving game development skills, Poly Knight's build really is impressive.

It’s January 13, 2017 – the day of the Nintendo Switch Presentation. Unbeknownst to anyone until today, Nintendo’s latest console is going to be released in under two months, and with it the latest installment in The Legend of Zelda series, Breath of the Wild. A hush goes over the crowd as the final trailer begins: stunning graphics, innovative open-world gameplay, calamitous (literally) storytelling. Streamers and reactors around the world are in awe. They’re screaming, crying, cheering. Anticipation is through the roof for what will soon usher in a new wave of popularity for one of Nintendo’s most beloved franchises.
Streaming on her own channel is former speedrunner Narcissa Wright. Many gamers will remember her famous 18:10 run of Ocarina of Time back in 2014, in which she set a new world record and quickly became one of the community’s most revered players. Then, she came out as transgender and was expeditiously abandoned by her community, including some of her most ardent fans. Wright has kept a low profile since then, streaming casual games to a smaller, more intimate audience. As she is moved to tears by the Breath of the Wild trailer, she sees the opportunity to stage a return to speedrunning and regain what was once hers. She logs onto Twitch and prepares to go live, captioning her stream with “I must surpass my past.”

For many of us, this was our main defence against the scorching fire caves for the majority of the game and the fact of the matter is, it just ain't cute. But what if you could explore Hyrule's hottest spots without needing to change into this monstrosity every time?
As it turns out, you can — in caves, at least. In a new glitch revealed by YouTube channel Gaming Reinvented, we can see that getting rid of Link's nasty habit of catching fire when not in the appropriate clothing is actually a rather simple one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wait and DLSee.
It seems that any additional content for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom might not be quite as set in stone as we initially thought after a recent Famitsu interview with series producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi seems to suggest that Nintendo currently has no plans for DLC.
Right from the get-go, it is worth bearing in mind that we are currently only able to read Famitsu's interview via the built-in Google Translate function, so there is a chance that the point of Aonuma's response has been somewhat lost in translation. That being said, the series producer's answer does seem to imply that TOTK DLC is not currently a concern for Nintendo.

        <updated>2023-09-06T09:57:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Tokyo Game Show is almost upon us, and it will run from September 21 to Sunday, September 24. Several publishers and developers have already confirmed that they'll be making an appearance, including Capcom and Square Enix, to name a few. Sega and Atlus will also be teaming up to make a splash.
To watch the stream, tune in on September 21 at 19:00 (UTC+8). Their line-up is a jam-packed one, making it worthwhile to keep an eye out for them during the event. From Sega, you can expect the following games:
Sonic Superstars 
Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name
ENDLESS Dungeon
Atlus will show off the following Persona games:
Persona 5 Tactica 
Persona 3 Reload
[caption id="attachment_402179" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Atlus.[/caption]
Tokyo Game Show 2023 has plenty planned
Sonic fans have had their eyes on Sonic Superstars for a while. It seeks to emulate the success of Sonic Mania, though it has adopted a little more modern art style while staying true to the gameplay of the classic titles. Persona 3 Reload's appearance at the show is also bound to raise some hype, as the upcoming game is a remake of the critically acclaimed Persona 3.
As you'd expect, Altus and Sega won't be the only ones at the show. Capcom has also confirmed that it'll be there, and we'll get to see more of Resident Evil 4 Remake's upcoming VR mode. Square Enix has a big line-up that includes oddballs like Power Wash Simulator and highly anticipated games like Dragon Quest Monsters 3: The Dark Prince.
Although the AAA headliners will naturally grab the most attention, indies haven't been neglected, and Sony will be showing off indie titles at the event. For the Tokyo Game Show's full schedule, visit the official site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sad news vis-a-vis playing Starfield on the Steam Deck: it runs like a slug, even on the lowest possible settings. And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

Do you yearn for the older, simpler days before the great Unrealification and the invention of sex scenes, when people called a spike pit a spike pit, and you could count all the different colours in a screenshot on your fingers? Do you, in fact, reject this framing of retro-styled 2D pixelart games as "older" and "simpler", regarding it as condescending and false? Look, shut up already. I'm trying to tell you about Isles of Sea and Sky from developers Jason Newman, Dan Collver and Craig Collver.

A large portion of '90s kids look back on Rugrats with great fondness. As one of the defining cartoons of both the decade and the network of Nickelodeon, Rugrats spawned its fair share of licensed video games, but last week's announcement of a new one still came as a shock. That game, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland, doesn't just feature retro sensibilities – it's an actual all-new retro game built in 2023. Though the first Rugrats video game didn't release until the late '90s, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland gives you the full retro experience, paying ho…]]></summary>

It makes going back to older and influential games like Chrono Trigger an interesting prospect, as playing the classic in 2023 can be its own little window in time, to see the impact of something right at the moment it hit. And the trial of Chrono Trigger did not disappoint.
It's not an overstatement to say Chrono Trigger has had a profound effect on the general gaming landscape. In fact, playing it nowadays, I can see all the ways in which games have paid homage and been inspired by it, even in the opening moments.
I'm in a bit of a unique position: I've never played Chrono Trigger. This is my first time experiencing this gem, after enough curiosity and ja…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that the next game getting a physical Atari XP release is 1978’s Outlaw. This game is one of the first created by legendary video game pioneer and Activision co-founder, David Crane. The Limited Edition of Outlaw is coming to the Atari 2600 platform just in time for the release of the Atari 2600+.
Outlaw is technically based on the 1976 arcade game of the same name, but it’s completely different. Some say the Atari 2600 version is a port, but I don’t see it. The arcade game involves drawing a gun when the onscreen character does and firing quicker than it. The Atari 2600 version is Combat with cowpokes.
However, Outlaw was a pretty early staple for competitive console owners. Unlike in the arcade, the 2600 version was two-player, and that was the best way to play it. It kind of sucked to play it on your own.
David Crane would leave Atari with some other developers, as they didn’t like Atari’s policy at the time when it came to crediting their developers (they didn’t). They founded Activision, where Crane created some classic titles, including Pitfall. Crane then left Activision near the end of the ‘80s because of a disagreement with the new CEO. He then moved around to different developers to create titles like A Boy and His Blob for the NES and assist with games like Night Trap.
The Outlaw Limited Edition is coming to the Atari 2600, and is available for preorder now for anyone in the US for $49.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(rock)Steady, this is another (be)bop.
When we first got our hands on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge last year, we were by no means of the impression that the game was lacking in the content department — this is, after all, what we deemed to be "the best Turtles scrolling beat 'em up ever". A little over a year later, the game's first DLC, 'Dimension Shellshock', is here to show that sometimes bigger is in fact better, and even more Turtle action is always a good thing.
This DLC comes as a rather solid package. Alongside several new character colour palettes (many of which come from a free update that launched alongside the DLC), there's also the addition of a brand new game mode, two fresh-faced fighters — Usagi Yojimbo (aka 'Miyamoto Usagi' in his original comics) and Karai (a mainstay of the 2003 animated TMNT series) — and a number of shredding original music tracks from composer Tee Lopes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlueTwelve Studio's cat-centric action-adventure game Stray is about to venture into new territory. Publisher Annapurna Interactive's own Annapurna Animation is working on an animated adaptation of the material. The feature is in development, and it won't be the last from the studio's library to receive such treatment.
Annapurna shared an update on its creative leadership, including the addition of Nimona co-director Nick Bruno and producer Julie Zackary. The only other project listed for development is Foo from Oscar-winning director Chris Wedge (Bunny, Ice Age). 
There isn't much in the way of further info on the adaptation of Stray. Beyond mentioning it as part of the slate, the press release says there are plans to "adapt more titles from their extensive Annapurna Interactive library."

The cat's pajamas
Considering Stray's relatively brief length, it seems like a solid fit for a film adaptation. BlueTwelve's futuristic feline fantasy launched on PlayStation consoles and PC in July 2022 before heading to Xbox platforms in August 2023. It garnered a lot of positive attention along the way. The story follows a stray cat as it prowls the streets of a walled city and attempts to unravel its mystery with the help of trusty drone B-12. How well the film will capture exploring a decaying cybercity through the eyes of a cat remains to be seen. 
Annapurna announced the launch of its animation division in December 2022, with former Disney Animation execs Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein on board. While we wait for more on Stray, you can catch the studio's adaptation of ND Stevenson's Nimona on Netflix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Deep Silver and developer Starbreeze have announced the upcoming technical beta for Payday 3. The co-op heist shooter will be available to everyone from September 8-11. According to Starbreeze, the test will serve as a stress test of sorts for the Payday 3 servers ahead of its September 21 launch.
Because it is open to all, the technical open beta will not require a key to gain access. Instead, anyone can download and join the test. If you played the recent closed beta test, the content in this open test will be the same. Apparently, it's based on an April 2023 build and not a final representation of Payday 3.
It's a great chance to check out the gameplay of Payday 3 ahead of its release later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A remake of 1994 arcade game Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves has been spotted as part of the Tokyo Game Show lineup as Snow Bros. 2: Special. New details have started to creep out since then.
We don’t know much. However, the Tokyo Game Show site lists the game as being for Switch and Steam. Also, if you zoom in on the promo image there, you can see that the remake is being developed by CRT Games, which isn’t surprising since they also handled 2022’s Snow Bros. Nick & Tom Special, a remake of the first game. Even though I reviewed it, my mind is such a blur, even though it came out last year.
According to CRT Games’ website, Snow Bros. 2: Special will add four-player co-op, new levels, and a “Monster Mode” to remix things. On top of that, the art style has been tweaked. It’s similar to the style used for Snow Bros. Nick & Tom Special, which I wasn’t particularly a fan of. It’s not bad, just not very imaginative, either. I doubt they’ll bring back the horrifying toddler pictures from the character select screen, but we can hope.
A Snow Bros. 2 remaster is definitely welcome, though. The title never reached North American arcades, nor has it been ported to console before, so I’ve never had the chance to play it. Both games were developed by Toaplan originally and are single-screen arcade titles similar to Bubble Bobble. Snow Bros. Nick & Tom Special was a competent remaster, but the game was just mostly okay to begin with.
Snow Bros. 2: Special is currently only slated for Switch and PC. No release date has been mentioned, but CRT Games does state that it will be coming worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the back-to-back launches of Sea of Stars and Starfield, it’s easy to forget that another star-themed RPG is coming this year. To hype the release of Star Ocean The Second Story R, Square Enix has uploaded the remake’s new anime intro to YouTube.
Technically speaking, this isn’t the first time Star Ocean: The Second Story has received an anime intro. Star Ocean: Second Evolution for the PSP already added one that probably would have worked just fine here. However, Square Enix seems to be pulling out all the stops for this remake. This one’s decidedly more action-packed, with a song that sounds like it should be featured in a game like Deemo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even if I primarily play it on PC and Xbox Series X, I'm still amazed that The Witcher 3 on Nintendo Switch (otherwise known as "The Switcher") fits on one physical cart. I'm also amazed that, nearly four years after the Switch version's October 2019 release, the publisher is still patching the game intermittently. This newest hotfix involves ambient audio issues, which should now be cleared up.
The hotfix addresses ambient audio issues
Here's the full statement from CD Projekt Red, via the Witcher game franchise's Twitter account:
"We have just released a hotfix for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on Nintendo Switch! It fixes the issue of ambient audio being absent for some players and resolves any regional restriction that was incorrectly applied on the Korean version of the game 🇰🇷 Be aware the game version won't change so if you are unsure if it has applied please check the date of the last update."

It's a small fix, but it's appreciated regardless! This port was a miracle in any context,
Other recent Witcher news mostly involves collector's items
Beyond that patch, there isn't much to report on The Witcher front, other than that it might be a while until we see any more games from CD Projekt Red.
A Geralt bust figure is up for pre-order now, as well as a Ciri collectible. Oh, and a Witcher version of Monopoly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a "game engine" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?
You'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using "the same engine" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.

Having launched just a few months prior to Starfield, Redfall was met with a wall of well-warranted critique. Yet, according to Bethesda's head of publishing, the book hasn't yet closed on Redfall.
While many might've expected to see Bethesda and Microsoft drop Redfall like a hot potato and never talk about it again, Bethesda's Pete Hines says to expect the opposite. In a recent interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Hines said that Bethesda will keep working on Redfall. This comes after the Xbox Head of Gaming, Phil Spencer, voiced his disappointment in the negative reaction to Redfall.

The PC version received its share of optimization and bug fixes, as well. Among the performance boosts on consoles is a solid 60 FPS in Performance Mode thanks to GPU and CPU optimization and disabling Ray Tracing. Those who prefer to play in Quality Mode should notice positive changes like reduced FPS fluctuation. 
The Jedi Survivor update also adds some other console-specific improvements, like Variable Refresh Rate support for PS5. On PC, support is in place for DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) image rendering tech along with "additional performance & optimization improvements."

Corruption like yours must be eradicated
Beyond the visual and performance tweaks, Patch 7 addresses some notable bugs. This includes tweaks to the save system aiming to prevent the corruption of game saves. Issues that previously left players unable to retrieve XP after dying under "certain circumstances" have also been fixed. Some of the other bugs and improvements addressed cover cloth, lighting, and UI fixes across all platforms. 
This update comes relatively hot on the heels of Patch 6.5, which arrived on July 18, 2023. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is currently available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Even in its initially buggy state, Respawn's latest has garnered plenty of acclaim since its April 28 launch. While there's no release date in place, EA previously discussed plans to bring the sequel to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One at some point.

Digital Eclipse, following on from Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, is continuing its trend of going back to the past to rekindle the games that kicked ass. While the Cowabunga Collection was wrapped in comic book paraphernalia and finished with a lick of old-fashioned Konami, The Making of Karateka follows the clean and tranquil stylings of Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection, a package we commended for being so thoughtfully arranged.
Digital Eclipse’s “interactive documentary” angle, thus far, has been somewhat pioneering, built with robust research, stuffed with original interviews, and showcasing unearthed and playable prototype materials. And, priced at a reasonable $19.99, there’s a good chance that anyone who sits down and actually sifts through everything in The Making of Karateka, from video interviews to superb audio commentaries, will probably spend more time with it than they do with most games, such is the attention span of today’s impulse buyers and the wealth of content on-board. Without even playing the games in the package, you can kick back and enjoy the story of how Karateka came to be, in alluring, personal detail.

Today, their flagship NEM-PA2TB 2TB SSD is down to $109.99 at Newegg, where you can even pick up a $10 gift card with the purchase - neat. 
For context, that ties the best price we've seen for a 2TB NVMe SSD, although this option comes with a heatsink and is therefore a better choice for many PC and all PS5 owners.

Just that paid add-on is a big deal, as it brings a hefty batch of new content. However, one might argue the 2.0 upgrades releasing alongside Phantom Liberty are an even bigger deal, as the update completely revamps many of the game's original mechanics and features.
Until now, what's coming as part of Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 versus the paid Phantom Liberty DLC hasn't been totally obvious. That's where CD Projekt Red's latest explainer helps, as the studio provided a rather detailed infographic plainly stating what's updated for free and what goodies cost extra.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a lot of big, blockbuster games hitting over the last few weeks, and that can get a bit tiring. So this weekend, as I was perusing the Steam new releases, I spotted a curious-looking game called Void Stranger. I didn't know what to expect, but it had some eager positive reviews and a novel idea.
What I got was one of the more pleasant surprises of the year. Void Stranger is a puzzling gem that I haven't been able to get out of my head.
Made by ZeroRanger studio Systems Erasure, Void Stranger is a puzzle game in the Sokoban genre; essentially, pushing and manipulating blocks. Even if you don't know the origin, you probably recognize the style from games like Baba Is You, Chip's Challenge, or (arguably) Catherine. The vast majority of your time playing is spent in a Game Boy-sty…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.
In a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. 
“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man," Pieces writes. "We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”
The studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. 


Alone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Bandai Namco has announced Retro Game Challenge 1 + 2 Replay, a remastered collection of two DS cult classics for Switch (thanks, Famitsu). At the moment, the collection has only been announced for Japan, and a release date hasn't been confirmed.
Retro Game Challenge is a series of video games based on the Game Center CX TV show in Japan, which stars Japanese comedian and actor Shinya Arino. The first game came out in 2007, with a North American release following in 2009. Retro Game Challenge 2 never received an official localisation due to disappointing sales in the West for the first game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed three new Switch bundles releasing next month. One is a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes a standard Switch model and the other two are special Animal Crossing: New Horizons-themed Switch Lite consoles that include the game. All three bundles will be released on October 6. 
The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle includes a standard Switch console, a digital version of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and a three-month individual membership for Nintendo Switch Online. You can check it out in the image below: 
As for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch Lite consoles, there’s Isabelle’s Aloha Edition, which is a pink Switch Lite with Animal Crossing leaves on the back of the console, and Tommy’s Aloha Edition, which is a teal Switch Lite with the same leaf details on the back of the handheld console. Both bundles will cost $199.99 and include a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Isabelle edition is exclusive to Target and the Tommy edition is exclusive to Walmart. 
You can check out both bundles in the gallery below: 

These three bundles come just days after Nintendo announced a new Mario Red Switch OLED console, which will cost $349.99 and releases on October 6 as well. Nintendo revealed this console during its Nintendo Direct for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which we went hands-on with to preview. 
While waiting for these new bundles, read Game Informer’s Mario Kart 8 Deluxe review and then read Game Informer’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons review.

A funny thing happened at (well, near) PAX West 2023. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the latest two-dimensional Mario game — and the first original one in over 10 years — was surprisingly made fully playable for Nintendo Live attendees and media alike ahead of its October 20th release on Nintendo Switch.
Anyone who’s watched preview footage of Wonder can attest to the game’s more whimsical nature, even for Mario’s standards; you’ve got the nighttime, moody-blue palette, a flower power-up that when touched sees Mario descend into Lewis Carrol-like dreamscapes, and, of course, the elephant in the room … Mario can turn into a freaking elephant.

Somehow, it has been almost a whole year since Splatoon 3 was released and Nintendo is gearing up to mark the occasion in the most appropriate fashion — with a Splatfest, of course. To make the upcoming event that bit more special, the weekend's splatting will not take place in a unique location as usual, but will instead see all eight Tricolor stages from previous Splatfests make a return.
The news was shared in a post on the Nintendo Japan website, before being shared to the website formally known as Twitter in a translated form by @OatmealDome. The full lineup of eight different stages even includes the special Scorch Gorge variant used for the earlier Zelda Splatfest, so this will be the perfect time to see the sights if you missed out on getting to visit the locations previously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day of sun.
Being a Rune Factory fan has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for the past several years. After Rune Factory 4 launched in 2013, the games went on hiatus for nearly a decade, with the fate of the series itself being pretty up in the air for most of that wait. Against all odds, and after a change in development teams and rights holders, Rune Factory 5 finally saw a release last year and… well, it had its issues. Despite the middling reaction, the developers evidently saw good enough sales numbers that they could justify greenlighting Rune Factory 6, and while we wait for them to finish that up, the team saw fit to re-release Rune Factory 3 to fill the gap. Rune Factory 3 Special shows its age here and there, but this is overall a strong entry in the long-running farm sim series—we just wish that more was done to take advantage of the opportunity to bring it to new hardware.
Rune Factory 3’s narrative opens on a rainy night with a monster falling from the sky and crashing to the earth below, alarming the residents of the town of Sharance. A girl quickly takes pity on the monster and brings it into her house, giving it a room to stay in and a bed to recover in, yet the monster is nowhere to be found the following morning and has instead been replaced by a mysterious boy (named Micah by default) who has a bad, convenient case of amnesia. Micah is given a spare home built right into the trunk of the great Sharance tree just outside town and his relaxing new life as a resident there begins while he slowly puts together the pieces of his past.

You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a "land on every planet" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a "land on no planets" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? 


What if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jubilejní 30. Virtuální Bastlírna přichází ještě před LinuxDays, kde budete moct strahovské bastlíře spatřit naživo. Nepromarněte proto příležitost vysondovat předem kdo na LinuxDays přijede a přijďte na Virtuální Bastlírnu prozradit téma Vašeho příspěvku! Samozřejmě, pokud si chcete nechat svoje téma až na LinuxDays jako překvapení, připravili si strahováci i zásobu novinek a zpráviček, o kterých si lze popovídat. Slyšeli jste třeba už o novém samozhášivém filamentu, MMU3, nové továrně TSMC v Evropě, Chameleonu Ultra, novém foťáku se SPAD senzorem nebo nových levných 12bitových osciloskopech?

Ze světa HW je tady bezdrátové kontaktní pole (ano, nejde o protimluv), nástroj pro montáž zápustných matek do plastu, USB-C tester, nové pokyny pro výrobu ENIG na plošných spojích či ukázka, jak vypadá výrobna flex plošných spojů.

Jako obvykle mají také bastlíři připravena témata nevážná. Vykopnout tuto rubriku lze postupem pro optimalizaci nadzvukového katapultu, ale mají i předražené chytré zámky od Applu, které otevře i batole, úsměvné varování před Flipper Zero (a jak se lidé baví tím, že RFID zařízení se považuje za více nebezpečné než samopal), sebevraždy tiskáren od Bambu Labs nebo Python v Excelu. Jako třešničku strahováci ukáží, jak došlo k "teroristickému" útoku na vlaky v Polsku (rychlokurz "jak nedělat zabezpečovací zařízení").

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 6. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

In the 22 years since Shenmue’s debut, I’ve played the game 23 times. Twenty-three times I’ve lived the life of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, watched his father die, and navigated his world and experiences. Each time I’ve realized something new about the game, the people who made it, or something new about myself.
Playthrough 23 was the most poignant of them all. I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.
More than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.

I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, "It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay." After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.
Breaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer. Players explore an area called the Overgrowth, collect weapons and gear, and fight off monsters. And though the…]]></summary>

Retro love letters are a dime a dozen these days. From titles that veer too close to the source material to games that take the kernel of an earlier game's original concept and expand it into previously unforeseen realms, nostalgic experiences are everywhere in the games industry. Yacht Club Games emerged as an early leader of this trend with its smash hit Shovel Knight, which took the 2D action-platformer genre and gave it several fun twists despite keeping the core gameplay and visual styles faithful to the 8-bit graphics with which many of us grew up. Similarly, Yacht Club's next game, Mina the Hollower, looks like a …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't have any firsthand insight to share on Void Stranger, which surprise-released on Friday, but when I read words like "forgotten labyrinth" and "traps that defy reason", I find myself reaching for my pen and inkwell, and when I encounter visuals that remind me of the nastier Zelda dungeons on Game Boy, I start vibrating gently in my chair, and when I see monochrome anime story scenes set to howling guitar and fuzzy chip tunes - well, here we are.
Void Stranger is the work of Finnish indie System Erasure, whose vertically scrolling shmup/mystery game ZeroRanger was one of Dominic Tarason's (RPS in peace) best games of 2018. The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People have talked about Baldur's Gate 3 going a bit wonk in the final chapter when you reach the titular big city. It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.
Spoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined.

While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.
I've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers. Let's put this proc gen through its paces.

That's right, this month's RPS Game Club pick is the alternate-reality detective adventure Hypnospace Outlaw!


Released in 2018 and developed by Tendershoot, Hypnospace Outlaw takes place in a warped version of 1999 where accessing the internet is done via a headband you wear while you sleep. You play as an enforcer - a moderator of sorts - tasked with keeping the users of Hypnospace in check by reporting any violations you discover on their personal web pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. 
But that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as "a giant interactive board game" that "lent into action RPG" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.

In the years since Sam Fisher’s last outing, 2013’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist, he’s made a handful of cameo appearances and even shown his battle-worn visage at a conference or two.

Nonetheless, Fisher was once the lead of a game momentous enough to compete for sales with Halo, have Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid team taking notes, and find itself referenced as the graphical and technical benchmark of the early Xbox years. With two decades of distance, it’s hard to see the defacto mascot of novelist Tom Clancy’s video game offshoot brand as anything other than the embodiment of its ethos; the avatar of Clancy’s own stabl…]]></summary>

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving. So, it's a good game to check out on Game Pass, or at least flick through the opening chapters.

It’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.

Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”
It’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.

That same week, I witnessed a behind-closed-doors demo, which showed off the gameplay loop and some more of the beautiful visuals, so when I had the chance to play this unique hybrid action/RPG this week, I jumped at the chance.
Dungeons of Hinterberg puts you in the shoes of Luisa, who has traveled to the new tourist hotspot in the Austrian Alps. People from all over the world are en…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is a relentlessly horny videogame, Alice B wrote back in August, and that certainly describes the shock I felt when noted Githyanki grouch Lae'zel abruptly informed me that she was down to clown, a whole three hours in. "Ms Lae'zel, I happen to be a graduate of BioWare Sex University," I told her sternly, adjusting my robe. "If I'm going to have a torrid liaison in an RPG it'll be 60 hours from now, just before the final battle, and let's face it, I'm more likely to get scared of alienating party members and end up friendzoning everybody."
Lae'zel proved persuasive, however - "I like the way you stink," was how I think she phrased it - and one risque fade-to-black later, we were triumphantly entwined in post-coital bliss. Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem. According to Larian CEO Sven Vincke, Baldur's Gate 3 characters were accidentally encoded to have very low standards at launch. Haha, I certainly can't relate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the bigger Discourse torpedoes aimed at Starfield's glittering hull over the past month has been its strict division between planetary surfaces and outer space. Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. 


Players and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly "to" and perhaps even "between" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!

"So allow me to take this opportunity to officially announce that development on a PC version is currently underway." There's no Final Fantasy 16 PC release date as yet. Yoshida hopes to be able to share more - together with some insights on the first wodge of Final Fantasy 16 DLC - "before the end of the year".

I’ve started to get some answers to the world’s intriguing questions and now that I see the end in sight, I’m not sure I’m ready to roll credits (although, like any Bethesda Game Studios RPG, the game continues after credits with faction questlines, side missions, and more). I could have last night, but my wife and I decided to watch a movie instead: Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol (one of the best in the series). I’ve seen it but she hadn’t, so I picked up my Backbone controller device for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and booted up Starfield to continue playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newcomer studio Sonka has released a new gameplay trailer for its horror game, Holstin. This new trailer reveals a fun twist on the game’s shooting mechanics and comes alongside word that there’s a demo now available on Steam. 
The trailer is short, running less than a minute, but it showcases the game’s terrifying ambiance, throwback visual style, and zombie-like creatures that have seemingly infested the small 1990s Polish town Holstin is set in. It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. 
Check out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” 
There’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. 
Holstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

Around the turn of the millenium, 1GB sticks were commonplace, and by doubling that amount over time we've gradually worked our way up to 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sticks of DDR4 and DDR5 being common sizes. Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.
This new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.


The premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality. Intriguing, right?

A new trailer provides a new look at Gunbrella’s explosive, retro-inspired action. Players control a woodsman seeking revenge for the death of his wife, with players using their weaponized umbrella to blast apart foes or as a platforming tool. For example, you can use the umbrella to glide, swing, or slide around levels, among other uses.


We went hands-on with Gunbrella’s Steam demo and walked away impressed. You can watch us give it a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today. 
Gunbrella will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is out on PC as part of its Deluxe Edition September 1 early access perk, and players have confirmed that it doesn’t support Nvidia’s DLSS upscaling technology for better resolution and performance. Many had suspected as much when Bethesda announced an exclusive partnership with rival chip maker AMD, but…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've covered Arc A770 deals a few times as of late, as Intel's aggressive pricing makes these 1080p/1440p graphics cards often a better value than alternatives from AMD and Nvidia. So too is it today, where you can pick up an Asrock Arc A770 8GB card for just $240 when you use code SSCV2886 at Newegg. That's a $50 reduction from its normal price and a great value for the level of performance on offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything "nice" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole "heresy" thing too far.


I'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.

You slap on some masks, choose your loadout, then get to robbing banks or stealing things from crates. Often, it ends in absolute chaos as you mow through waves of coppers and rush to a getaway van. The number three might not signal a sweeping change to the formula, then, but that's arguably a good thing. It's a better-looking version of its predecessors that doesn't lose sight of the co-op silliness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Leftfield Collection is always one of my favourite areas to visit at EGX. Partly because it's regularly stuffed full of interesting indie games with often very neat and unusual controllers attached to them (which in previous years have included actual paper shredders and full-on Morse code machines), but also because they're often so new and hot off the digital presses that I've never even heard of them before, which is very, very exciting to me. It's a great little space to discover what will be the next talking points of video games-to-be, and this year's line-up looks to be no exception. Here are all the games you'll be able to play at this year's Leftfield Collection at EGX 2023.

Fans of the series have been asking for it for years now, especially since all the other mainline Borderlands games are playable on the console. Developer Gearbox Software is finally delivering and it's doing so on October 6. 
It's not just Borderlands 3 that's coming to Switch. Gearbox says it is specifically the Ultimate Edition of the game, which features all six content add-ons and a collection of bonus cosmetic packs. 
Here's what you get in the Ultimate Edition of Borderlands 3:

I felt it was so close, too close, to Bloodborne in everything from the cadence of the Chalamet puppet's jog, to the "duhhnng" noise of pickups, and the gothic sheen of its streets. At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.
But a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's "almost positive" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda "embraces chaos" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't "particularly fair".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally, it’s Lenovo’s turn to have a go at handheld gaming PCs with the newly-announced, Windows 11-powered Legion Go. It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.


These are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …]]></summary>

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

The announcement of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which acted as the grand finale of June's Nintendo Direct, caught many off guard. Not only is Nintendo moving away from the well-worn tread of the New Super Mario Bros. franchise for the 2D side of the series, but it is taking Mario in new directions with a larger roster of playable characters, unprecedented gameplay conventions, and all-new power-ups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't remember this at the time, but there were complaints about Skyrim's map when it came out, because it was just an extreme zoom out on the world. It wasn't dense with information; the map markers were often kind of an "it's in this area" guideline that were even less helpful if what you needed was in a barrow or otherwise underground. Starfield raises the bar by taking the bold step of having a map that is almost not a map.
I'm referring here to the planet surface map. The starmap is, like a couple of things I've experienced since being hustled through quite an accelerated inciting incident (Starfield's equivalent of Patrick Stewart dying in a sewer after he's charged you with saving the world), reminiscent of Mass Effect. You can select different galaxies, which have one or two solar systems in them, and then can zoom down and select specific planets or moons or whatever to warp to. Once you're wombling about on the surface being a naughty little space captain - or whatever, I don't judge what you're up to - well baby, I hope you like blue voids with a bit of topography.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is a massive, intimidating video game that, for better and worse, doesn't spend a lot of time tutorializing its gameplay and systems. It means the opening hours of the game can be particularly confusing, but the tips below, gathered by the Game Informer staff, should help alleviate at least some confusion you might be experiencing early in the game.
Stay On The Main Path, At Least For Awhile
Starfield lets you loose pretty quickly, and it is tempting to just start planet hopping right away, but you will do yourself a favor by sticking to the main path for at least a few hours. Our suggestion is that you play at least enough Constellation missions to find a mysterious temple. It may feel restrictive to hold yourself back, but you will be grateful to give yourself the time to learn…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brought to you by the teeming brains behind Snake Cave and Eat Shit With Divine, Starfield is an experience of almost bewildering scale that defies easy summary, but I will do my best. In this much-anticipated sci-fi action epic, you step into the spaceboots of Prince Starfield, a fully customisable, unvoiced protagonist who must battle a cosmic menace in the course of a familiar, but thrillingly woven narrative with unabashed political dimensions.
Not to be confused with NickTitle’s rather more contemplative game of the same name, to say nothing of Kenneth Nietfeld’s swashbuckling romance Rick Starfield: Hero of Space and Time, or indeed Starfield from Graek Tarmikos, an avant garde reinterpretation of Breakout, joeAmerica Gayms’ Starfield is a straightforward but engrossing blend of action and customisation elements. It’s the same heady brew of role-playing possibilities we’ve come to expect from the resourceful creator of Abandoned Bog.

Even in the increasingly crowded marketplace of big, expansive games, Starfield stands out. Leveraging the gameplay Bethesda popularized with The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, Starfield expands the breadth of exploration to a galaxy of solar systems, planets, and ships. It populates those environments with a rich palette of activities and missions that tap into the outer space fantasy. It’s a staggering span of content to wrap one’s head around. At times, that scope threatens to impair the focus and pacing, and moment-to-m…]]></summary>

The Mario Red Edition Switch OLED is coated in the plumber’s classic shade of red and the dock even includes a couple of Mario silhouettes and hidden coins on the backside, as you can see in the photo below. 
The console does not include a copy of Wonder, mainly because it hits store shelves a couple of weeks beforehand on October 6. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, meanwhile, launches on October 20. Still, if you're a passionate Mario fan looking for an excuse to upgrade to an OLED model, this version will set you back $349.99.]]></summary>

However, today's showcase was packed to the brim with gameplay reveals and new details, and now we've got a much clearer picture of what this game will look like. Wonder no longer: here's everything we learned from the Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct.


The game starts when Prince Florian, ruler of the Flower Kingdom, has his castle stolen by Bowser. After fusing with a Wonder Flower, the king of the Koopas is able to fly over this new land, populating it with his chaotic cronies. As always, it's up to Mario and friends to save the day, but this time around, he's got more buddies than usual. In addition to Luigi, Peach, and a pair of Toa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria is a survival game that certainly shares something in common with both Valheim and Deep Rock Galactic: you and a few buds sink pits and set out on expeditions to mine ore, batter monsters, and push further into the darkness. Having watched its game director Jon-Paul Dumont steer me through a 30-minute demo, I’ve come away with the impression it’s far more than just a cheap LOTR pretender. The game strikes me as a real competitor, with well thought out story beats and crafting treats to make Moria’s restoration a hearty adventure… or, if you'd prefer, the equivalent of a Powerwash Simulator.

When A.K.I. joins the fight next month, she’ll be the 20th playable character in Street Fighter 6, following the first DLC fighter, Rashid, who hit the game in July. Like Rashid and all future DLC fighters, players will encounter A.K.I. across all three modes of Street Fighter 6: World Tour, Fighting Ground, and the Battle Hub.

        <updated>2023-08-31T11:45:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged "cut content". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being "left out" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.


Developers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. "Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3," Gaider wrote on Twix. "BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts."

This is Holstin, a Polish survival horror experience in which you merrily rove an isolated town that, based on 14 minutes of fumbling around in exactly one very unwelcoming house, already seems a match for Silent Hill in terms of existential squalor. A public playtest is underway, and I've got a trailer for you through the jump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Officially unveiled at this week's Panic Games Showcase, Arco is a triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape. It's a part of the world we don't often get to see in games, and its stunning pixel art (and tiny cute little llamas) instantly caught my eye when I got to play an early mission from it at last week's Gamescom. Made by four developers spread across the globe, the official genres listed on its Steam page describe it as a tactical turn-based action adventure RPG where you guide four separate heroes in their fight against the ominous sounding Red Company. But just saying it's turn-based is doing Arco a disservice, I think, as it's also a little bit real-time, a little bit simultaneous turns, and all pretty brilliant, if you ask me. Here are some very early impressions of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will make use of Modulate's ToxMod AI to help moderate voice chat in multiplayer, Activision have revealed. The system won't detect offences in real time, nor will it be able to kick you from games for effing and blinding. It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.
You can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing. The tech is being beta-tested from today, 30th August in Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone in North America, with the English-language worldwide release to land alongside Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Ubisoft revealed Assassin’s Creed Mirage last September during a special stream celebrating the series’ 15th anniversary, the game was up to bat as the next in the long-running series. Set to hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC for $49.99 with a scaled-back approach and a much shorter runtime, Ubisoft indicated it was using Mirage to return to the series’ roots, serving as a spiritual successor to Altair’s adventure that started it all. 
However, Mirage wasn’t always its own game; it started as DLC to 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. 


“At first, we were working on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and the DLC, and the idea came up to create a specific expansion for Valhalla and go back to the Middle East,” Mirage creative director Stephane Boudon tells me in the Ubisoft Bordeaux office. “We want…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-30T16:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Sony announced the next slate of monthly games for the month of September. It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.
The PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.
On September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:
Essential - $79.99 (from $59.99)
Extra - $134.99 (from $99.99)
Premium - $159.99 (from $119.99)
You can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.
In the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.
The move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising. But if you’re looking to sign up for PS Plus or extend/change a subscription, now would be the time in order to save some money.]]></summary>

Enter the Chronosphere feels like one of those games. Devised by Melbourne, Australia-based Effort Star, it sees you assembling a crew of alien roughnecks to breach and despoil astral "gigastructures" in top-down view. These gigastructures consist of tightly-packed disc-shaped labyrinths with distinct colour schemes, vegetation and screwy spacetime dynamics. 


One of the PR bulletpoints calls on you to "choose between stabilizing your wounds, or reality itself." You'll also get to "plunder paradoxes" and kill people with wasps. Quite the spread! Let's have a look at the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Appropriately for third-person shooters featuring icky electric zombies, Invader's Daymare series has crept up on me. The second game, Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle, launches today. It casts you as Dalila Reyes, a special agent of Hexacore Advanced Division for Extraction and Search, aka H.A.D.E.S., and - wait a minute, I know this vibe! That annoying acronym? The washed-out, cadaver-on-concrete set dressing? The gimmicky ice-gun and scanner mode puzzles? The not-so-subtle undertones of Monolith and Midway? Characters with big glowy gadgets on their backs, so you can track them through poorly-lit warehouses?


For all the 90s setting, this looks to me like a homage to shooters of the early/mid noughties, when every action game took place in an office block, prison or garage, featured some kind of paranormal auxiliary ability, and owed a few cinematic chromosomes to the Matrix. Get a load of that trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a February 2022 Nintendo Direct, it was announced that the first three mainline Front Mission games would get modern remakes exclusively for Switch. Front Mission 1st: Remake hit last November, and now, nearly a year later, we finally know when Front Mission 2 will arrive.
That date is October 5, following a delay from it's previously announced June 12 launch. Front Mission 2’s revival is significant because it has never been released outside of Japan, originally hitting shelves in 1997. Set 12 years after Front Mission 1st, it stars Ash, an O.C.U. soldier who tries to escape the nation of Alordesh after its overrun by a revolutionary group, only to discover a broader conspiracy. Check out its story trailer below. 


The remake’s features include improved loading times (addressing a big criticism of the original version), free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new coloring/camouflage options, and additional language support. 
Front Mission 2: Remake will be available for $34.99. To keep up with every major upcoming remake, be sure to visit our complete list of them here.]]></summary>

I won’t pretend to completely understand what the exact measure of the game is, but I'm both excited to see more and a tad worried it could end up being a disjointed, overstretched mash of things that don't form a cohesive whole.

These remasters were revealed last September, packaged into the same collection and given a release window of 2023 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Destiny storyline opened following the collapse of a vast Terran civilization at the hands of an invading, amorphous Darkness and its various alien accomplices - an advance stymied only by a benevolent Big Dumb Object known as the Traveller. It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. 


Fast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, "episodic" - content "cadence" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far bet it from me to complain about Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The London Case introducing more incongruous eye candy, after my previous conniptions over Hot Hipster Poirot with his ankle-grazer trousers and his sexy egg-shaped head, but tick tock, it's himbo Hastings o'clock. Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).
Technically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.

Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.
"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out'," Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. "In fact, it was the opposite," he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced a few years back, the general response was "who on Middle-earth would want to play as Gollum". I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's "creative sequel" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the "what if" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield. Find a trailer through the jump.

The government-backed Cinema Fund says piracy carries “reputational risks” and that would be “inappropriate” right now. A furious cinema chief has accused the fund and government of protecting Western copyright holders. He says that Russia needs pirated copies of Barbie in cinemas, sooner rather than later.

These slapstick delights made it a cult classic, but rights-holders Ubisoft haven't done much with the game since.

Now a group of modders have been given a "completely blank check" by Ubisoft to do what they want with their efforts to build a modding SDK for the nearly 20-year-old game, and their ambitions include co-op and raytracing.

We traveled to France to speak with Ubisoft Bordeaux, a relatively new studio in the worldwide company’s massive stable of studios. After opening its doors in 2017, Ubisoft Bordeaux has worked mainly as a support studio to others in the Ubisoft umbrella. But after leading development on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s Wrath of the Druids DLC, the team was given a chance to create a full game.

Beginning at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET the Direct will run for about 15 minutes and, hopefully, peel the curtain back on Wonder’s new features and power-ups. The game's biggest change centers on the Wonder Flower, which transforms stages into trippy versions of themselves laden with mind-bending effects. More than anything, however, we’re excited to see more of Mario's new elephant transformation as well as the elephant versions of his friends.

The game is slated to launch on Switch on October 20.

A game that distills the best traits of classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI and injects them with a hefty dose of sports entertainment? Sign me up. However, what begins as a great idea on paper falls apart thanks to a botched execution that sees the game stepping on rakes any time it tries to pick up momentum.

While we were at Sega learning about Sonic Superstars, we had the opportunity to sit down with social media manager Katie Chrzanowski to hear the story of how this visual novel murder mystery came to be.

        <updated>2023-08-28T16:54:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is almost here. Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. 


Here are the PC specifications for Starfield: 
Minimum: 
OS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti
DirectX: Version 12
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
Recommended: 
OS: Windows 10/11 with updates
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080
DirectX: Version 12
Network: Broadband Internet connection
Storage: 125 GB available space
Additional Notes: SSD Required
As you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. 
Starfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. 
While waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. 
Are you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arleen Sorkin, veteran actress and the original voice and inspiration behind the popular DC character Harley Quinn, has passed away. She was 67.
The news was announced last night. Sorkin’s credits span numerous sitcoms and other TV series throughout the ‘80s, but her biggest break came in the launch of 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series. Creator Paul Dini wanted to introduce a new character to serve as the Joker’s one-off sidekick. After watching an episode of Days of Our Lives featuring a dream sequence of Sorkin playing a medieval court jester, Dini found his inspiration and contacted Sorkin with the intention of having her play this new villain for a single appearance. Her now-iconic portrayal of Harley Quinn resonated with fans, and she became the breakout character of the show. Harley…]]></summary>

Sea of Stars is like a great genre film by a skilled director. It looks and feels familiar; you basically know what to expect and can probably even predict the major beats, but it doesn’t hinder the experience. The intention is so well-executed that I was eager to soak it all in and, in this case, swim in the stars. I dreaded Sea of Stars’ conclusion not because I feared the worst but because I didn’t want to leave the world and stop playing.

On the first day of the new season this month, around 100 pirate service 'violations' were reportedly identified, but none were blocked. According to an inside source, Italy's "insane" blocking system isn't quite ready, but will "solve digital piracy" early October latest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 will feature a familiar face in actor Shawn Ashmore. While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. 
Ashmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. 
The brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx
August 25, 2023
“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment," says Ashmore in the video. "Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will."
Alan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest. You can watch the latest trailer from Gamescom 2023 here and read our impressions of a Summer Game Fest demo featuring Saga here.]]></summary>
