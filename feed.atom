Without a shadow of a doubt, one of the biggest and most exciting announcements of Summer Game Fest has been Atlus' reveal of Persona 3 Reload, a full remake of the classic 2006 PS2 RPG and a title for which fans have been pleading for the longest time — Unfortunately, however, the reveal came with some caveats that have left some in the community a tad disappointed.
First and foremost, Persona 3 Reload is a remake of the vanilla Persona 3 release. As such, it will not contain any of the updated edition content — such as story expansion The Answer, or the additional difficulty options. Reload will also not feature the content of Persona 3 Portable, which means no playable female protagonist, lovingly referred to by the community as "FemC". In addition, Persona 3 Reload will al…]]></summary>

Despite the promising debut trailer for Sonic Superstars, a niggling feeling of doubt had crept into our minds prior to our hands-on session with the game at Summer Game Fest. After all, this latest side-scrolling effort from Sonic Team really has two things going against it straight away. Number one; aside from the spectacular Sonic Mania (which was developed by Christian Whitehead, Headcannon, and PagodaWest), this is really the first pure '2D' Sonic game since the much-maligned two episodes of Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and number two; it's primarily being developed by Arzest, a team perhaps best known for co-developing Balan Wonderworld alongside Square Enix.

Oh, Diablo 4? It’s alright, yeah. Quite fun. But it’s recently taken a backseat to something far more illustrious. His name, the subtitles inform me, is Denysov, and he lives in Diablo IV's world of Sanctuary. He is a lone man, with a lone hammer, who, despite nightmare and terror unfolding all around him, come hell or harsh splinters, just works on his lovely door all darn day.

Diesel Legacy: The Brazen Age is here to fix that, mixing up the classic punch 'em up formula with three lanes for you to manoeuvre around during 2v2 fights. The result looks messy, but also interesting enough that you might want to try the currently-running free open beta.

Modus Games took to the PC Gaming Show to reveal Diesel Legacy: The Brazen Age, an all-new tag-team fighting game that will be making its way to Switch.
This is a genre that increases in size by the day, but Modus (also on development duties here via the in-house Modus Studios) is attempting to stand out from the combat crowd by focussing on 2v2 battles and introducing a three-lane system to lend the fights an extra strategic edge. Instead of taking place on a single line of action, the three-lane division will have you moving up and down the depth of the arena to either gain an advantage over an enemy who is preoccupied with your partner or get some space to breathe.

This also includes some notable gaming-related subreddits.
For those who are not in the know, the reason for the blackout has to do with recent changes that have been implemented. A recent thread gives insight into what the protest is about. In a nutshell, as of May 31, 2023, Reddit raised its prices for access to its API, the "application programming interface" that third-party apps use in order to build their own Reddit software.

It's coming from some veteran EVE devs, who place an emphasis on community, inclusivity and player agency. I suspect I will never play it, but will very much enjoy reading about those who do.

Remedy has been on a bit of a journey since the first Alan Wake.

With Alan Wake 2, it feels like Remedy is returning to the series with both new concepts and ideas built over the years since Wake's first venture.
In a hands-off demo of Alan Wake 2 at Summer Game Fest 2023, I got to see an extended look at just how that adventure will play out. The first big note is that Alan Wake 2 will feature two protagonists, with different viewpoints and sets of missions.

Elsewhere, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still hanging in there in the top 10, despite quite a few shuffles in the line-up this week. Minecraft has managed to climb another position, while Minecraft Legends is nowhere to be seen.

Square Enix announced the highly anticipated demo for Final Fantasy XVI will launch worldwide tomorrow on the PlayStation Store. A listing for the demo had appeared on the Store earlier this month for some users, but it was not available for download. While this news may confirm what some already knew, it's still incredibly exciting for those looking forward to Square Enix's hotly anticipated RPG.
The announcement states the demo will release worldwide on June 12th at 4:00 AM EDT. Here's a nifty map they posted to show what time the demo will be available for you.

The PC Gaming Show is never a stream I focus on as I don't really game on my PC. But with so many of these games jumping over to console, I decided to give it a go this year and I'm glad I did. Because had I skipped the show, I likely wouldn't have learned about Parcel Corps.
From developer Billy Goat Entertainment and publisher Secret Mode, Parcel Corps puts players in the shoes of a freelance bike messenger who must make their deliveries before time runs out. The game takes place on New Island where three delivery companies are just waiting to pay you the least amount of money legally possible to do your job. That's the gig economy for you, baby!
While making deliveries is the name of the game, players can also pull off some sick tricks on the halfpipes and ramps scattered across the city's nine areas, terrify rooftop pigeons, and, if they're in the mood, overthrow a totalitarian government.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sso5T3ovzmE
Cheesy trailer aside, Parcel Corps certainly has my attention with its colorful world, inviting gameplay, and anti-capitalistic messaging. I mean, the villain of the game is named Rich Villainé. That alone makes me want to play this just so I can knock that fucker down a few notches.
Like a lot of the games revealed today, Parcel Corps will arrive in 2024 on an unspecified date. When it does land, the game will release for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.

Vampire Survivors continues to be the indie gift that keeps on giving. After a stellar debut last year, in which it won Best Game at the British Academy Games Awards and the Destructoid award for Best PC Game, the developer is showing no signs of slowing down support for the game. So far, it's seen two paid DLC expansions and several free updates. Its next free arrives tomorrow, and it's packing in some great reason to return to the monster-infested fields of Italy.
Dubbed the "Overwhelming Update," Vampire Survivors version 1.5 adds new features, new levels, a new game mode, and half a new character. The new stage, Astral Stair, is a near-endless series of corridors featuring flying paintings and a new spinning wheel that'll trigger random events within the stage. The character Yatta Cavallo is getting a new form in the update, and the new relic GoldFinger will start a limited-time challenge where your character is powerful and invisible for a brief amount of time. If you care about achievements, the update is adding six of those to the game too.

Ignore what it says in the trailer about the update being available now. The Vampire Survivors Overwhelming Update will hit all platforms tomorrow, June 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bah fun(?)-bug
A Christmas Carol is a timeless classic that remains a staple of the holiday season, with producers in film and television taking advantage of its public domain status every couple of years to pop out another version of the story that'll never be as good as Scrooged or The Muppet Christmas Carol. I've seen plenty of productions of it during my near-40 years on this Earth, but I don't think I've ever seen the story tackled in a video game.
Perhaps that's why Ebenezer and the Invisible World was the most amusingly confounded trailer at the PC Gaming Show. From Orbit Studio and Play on Worlds, Invisible World tells the story of what happens after the ghosts helped Scrooge become a new man. I'm not sure if Dickens ever planned for a sequel, but I have to imagine if he did write one, it wouldn't have had the geezer down-kicking bad guys or using the power of the ghost of Haley Hall to pass through ethereal gates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmo07RJg2Aw
I'm not going to say I'm sold on the idea of reinventing one of literature's most famous tales as a metroidvania, but it's certainly a lot more interesting than just turning into a horror game. Plus, the holiday setting is charming, and the hand-drawn environments are scrumptious.
Ebenezer and the Invisible World is in development for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch. Hopefully, it can make it to storefronts before Christmas. A 15 GB demo of the game is now live on Steam.

You can also imagine my excitement when they said it would be out later this year, too. Not in 2024, or several years down the line, but in the next 12 months. Absolutely my favourite thing in the world, reveals like that. Can't get enough of them. So picture how I must be feeling right now, having just heard Shadow Gambit's actual release date at tonight's PC Gaming Show. Time to mark your calendars, folks. We'll be stealth murdering our way around its Lost Caribbean on August 17th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors just can't seem to die, but it's unclear whether that's due to its attentive development team or the immortal nature of vampires. Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.


The update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.
Vampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. For more on the game, check out why we gave it such a high review, or learn about its upcoming TV adaptation.]]></summary>

I adored the first one - and even picked it for May's RPS Game Club - but the prospect of a sequel seemed almost too good to be true. Happily, tonight's PC Gaming Show brought the news I was waiting for. After a dramatic animated trailer reveal, I'm happy to report that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is indeed a real thing, and I spoke to Damian Martin earlier this week to find out all about it.

Thirsty Suitors has been on my radar since its reveal a few years ago. It mixes a beautiful, unique, and saturated visual style, turn-based combat, great voice acting, and skateboarding. It’s a busy mix on paper, but after playing it for roughly 30 minutes during Summer Games Fest, I’m walking away excited for more. 
After a rough breakup, protagonist Jala returns home. But doing so isn’t easy because that former relationship created turmoil in her other relationships back home, including her parents, sister, friends, and more. Now home, Jala seeks to repair these…]]></summary>

Alongside a fresh look at the game's 1000 planets, combat and skill trees, we were given a closer peek at arguably the most important part of the whole game: its character creator.


Described as the "simplest character creator" the team have ever made, Starfield will let you dig into the finer details of your space captain's face, right down to their teeth for reasons I can't quite work out yet. An improvement on the creators found in previous Bethesda games, there's nothing here that looks particularly innovative compared to other open-world games of this ilk. What's interesting is that this time around, the team have used the in-game tool to create every last one of Starfield's NPCs.

Starfield features over 1000 planets to visit, each procedurally generated upon your approach but populated with handcrafted elements. Your "freedom" upon landing on these planets - many of which seem near-barren - is whether you spend your time doing some quests, 'surveying' the local flora and fauna, or shooting rocks with your space laser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After learning that the Citizen Sleeper team had another game in the works, we were excited to try whatever came next, whenever that was. Today's PC Gaming Show gave us an exciting update, and much sooner than we might have expected: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is currently in development.


The sequel takes place in the same world as the last, "some time" after the events Citizen Sleeper. As an escaped android with a malfunctioning body, you'll have to gather a crew, command a ship, and do what it takes to stay alive. If you want to keep an eye out for future updates, the game already has a Steam page.
If this game is anything like its predecessor, we're all in for a treat. We were big fans of the original Citizen Sleeper, with its inspired story and narrative mechanics leading to our reviewer calling it "a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." It also scored a spot on our Top Ten Games of 2022.]]></summary>

At the combined Xbox Games Showcase slash Starfield Direct tonight, Bethesda did a deep dive on a few aspects of their upcoming space RPG Starfield - including the companion system. Although, given that you assign them to different tasks on your ship and various outposts, it might be more appropriate to call them "employees". Although again, you can romance some of them, which is definitely an HR issue.

The good news is that you'll soon be able to do exactly that, as tonight's PC Gaming Show confirmed that Jumplight Odyssey will be getting a Steam Next Fest demo on June 19th. That's just over a week away at time of writing, and having played an early version of that demo myself, I'm pleased to report that it's shaping up very nicely indeed - even if my first attempt ended in catastrophic disaster after I was boarded by half a dozen crews of angry green alien lads.

We’ve known it is a sci-fi game about traveling between planets from the creators of Skyrim for some time, but during Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase, Bethesda pulled back the curtain in a big way.
Alongside showing plenty of gameplay covering everything from walking around densely populated cities to exploring unpopulated planets to combat inside and outside of spaceships, Bethesda detailed some of the game’s story and impressive customization options.

The new area of Dogtown is pretty sweet, too.

I’d drive around, shoot some enemies, and listen to Run The Jewels on the in-game radio. Satisfied with my V’s ending, I didn’t have a reason to return to the meat of the ca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clockwork Revolution made its debut at today’s Xbox Games Showcase via a trailer that set the stage for its steampunk-flavored RPG action.
The first-person adventure puts you in control of a woman hailing from the steam-powered Victorian-era city of Avalon who discovers a time machine, along with the revelation that the city – and its brutal oppression of the lower class – is the result of intricate time manipulation by the villainous Lady Ironwood. To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a butterfly effect on the Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. 


The game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. 
Clockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.]]></summary>

It's been a busy weekend of streams, and today was one of the big ones. Microsoft took to the stage in Los Angeles for its dual-header of the Xbox Games Showcase 2023 and its Starfield Direct. The first half is all about Xbox, between its first-party and third-party offerings, while the latter puts the lens squarely on Bethesda's impending RPG.
The summer may be a little off this year without E3, but today's show felt strong to me. Maybe it's the sheer variety, from new originals to first-party reveals. Or maybe it's that, even with some leaks, Xbox managed to get a few moments of surprise. As far as trailer-bonanzas go, I feel like it was a good one. A lot of the games are aimed towards 2024, though.
Still, with a big Cyberpunk update and the massi…]]></summary>

A little over two years ago, I stumbled across the Twitter account for Microbird, a game developer working on a quaint-looking action-RPG called Dungeons of Hinterberg. I loved the art direction, the setting, and the character design; it checked a lot of boxes for me. I told myself I'd try to keep the game in mind, but that didn't happen. I forgot about it until I saw the debut trailer for the game in today's Xbox Game Showcase.
Free from the awful Twitter video player, the game still looks outstanding and is once again checking all those same boxes for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-3NsH82HA
I don't want to get myself too hyped for it as that tends to bite me in the butt with indies. But consider this one of my most anticipated games of next year. Dungeons of Hinterberg will launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC next year and will be on Xbox Game Pass day one.

Mainly: bigger cities, more simulated cities, prettier cities. 

It also brought news of a release date: October 24th.

This carbon black version of the slimmer Xbox boasts roughly double the storage of its original white counterpart. That also means it’s more expensive, retailing for a hundred bucks more at $349.
As a reminder, the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive. It's also weaker than the $500 Series X, but even this new version remains a decent budget option for those looking to enter the current generation of gaming.

Though the Xbox Games Showcase showed off many follow-ups to well-established names, we've gotten some totally original titles too. A prime example of this is Clockwork Revolution, a new game from the creators of Wasteland.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDFuhaYxeMU
In a blog post by InXile Studio Head Brian Fargo, we fortunately find a few details to give this world some context. As the title might imply, Clockwork Revolution will focus heavily on time travel. Fargo promises both "dynamic time-bending combat" and a plot centered around the gimmick. It looks like players will find themselves traveling to the past and making choices that will affect the future in substantial ways.
The post notes the team is "pushing roleplaying reactivity to new heights" with this game, so we'll have to see how much player choice impacts the final product.
That said, don't expect to see Clockwork Revolution anytime soon. The post clarifies that the game is "still early in development," and that this is just a sneak peak. The trailer says the game will "come in due time," so we'll stay tuned to learn more.
At the very least, some of you may wind up with Clockwork Revolution whether you like it or not. The title will launch on Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will appear day one on Game Pass.

Now here’s something that I can get excited for. Cities Skylines 2 has gotten an actual in-game trailer and a release date for October 24th.
Oh, yeah. This is a good trailer. It shows off the upgraded visuals of Cities Skylines 2, and a UI which is a mix of familiar and new. There are exciting features like being able to build both roads of a divided highway at the same time. I don’t know how to make that sound exciting, but trust me, it’s amazing. It shows a number of other improved traffic-related upgrades. You can just make grids of roads now, but I hope you’re not an individual who just sticks to grid designs for cities. I expect better from you.
https://youtu.be/QZW39Yml3a8
Beyond that, the engine once again looks nicer, but absolutely familiar. However, if there’s one thing that gets my blood pumping, it’s weather effects. Cities Skylines had snow, but you were essentially just picking a snow-city map, and that was about it. Your city was just a snow-city. A brief moment in the trailer shows snow accumulating. Again, this might be something that a normal person doesn’t get, but it absolutely gets me excited.
I thankfully don’t have to wait too long. Cities Skylines 2 is coming October 24, 2024. As part of this, Microsoft has announced it is coming to Xbox Gamepass.

But for those who were wondering about the story missions the company showed off when it revealed the game in 2019, they can rest somewhat easy: Overwatch story still exists, and we got a new…

As part of today's Xbox Games Showcase, CD Projekt RED (and Keanu Reeves himself) announced that it is opening pre-orders on Phantom Liberty, the delayed DLC expansion for its rollercoaster release, Cyberpunk 2077. The DLC is available to pre-order now on all platforms, priced at $29.99 or local equivalent.
Anyone pre-ordering the Phantom Liberty DLC will receive a bonus item in the form of a snazzy muscle car, the Quadra Vigilante. This car will unlock at the start of the expansion and ensure that V is looking pretty damn ace as they whiz their way around Night City. The new DLC will open up a brand new district in the hazardous 'berg, and will also star Idris Elba as FIA agent Soloman Reed.
The Phantom Liberty expansion DLC was expected to arrive a little closer to Cyberpunk 2077's 2020 launch, but production was slowed as the developer instead focused on polishing the original release, which famously received one of the most notoriously disappointing launches (at least technically) in the modern gaming sphere. Cyberpunk 2077 has since launched on Gen9 platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is generally considered to be in a far cleaner, higher-quality state.
Cyberpunk 2077 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

As part of the Xbox Games Showcase 2023, Atlus has shocked the world by announcing Persona 5: Tactica both suddenly and abruptly. Surely, no one could have seen this one coming.
Persona 5 Tactica brings the turn-based RPG gang over to the world of turn-based tactics. It seems the Phantom Thieves have been sucked into a realm of grids and polite people who take turns with everything. Wow! Here’s a trailer!
https://youtu.be/6iPrNxNdmhk
This comes alongside the also very sudden and abrupt announcement of Persona 3 Reloaded. Atlus has proven themselves the masters of surprise by dropping these two completely unpredictable announcements completely without warning. Wow!
Persona 5 Tactica even has a release date that has never before been revealed. It’s November 17, and it will also be available on Xbox Gamepass. Who would have guessed!?

The trailer also came with a release date: September 21st.

Outlaws was revealed tonight at the Xbox Games Showcase with a trailer that had an extended opening metaphor bit about gambling that was trite enough for me to assume it was a trailer for the Quantic Dream Star Wars game. BUT. I do like the look of Outlaws (currently slated for 2024).

Overwatch 2 was originally created to add this exact new content to the beloved hero shooter, but months went by without any updates on story or PvE game modes. Last month, the developers updated the community with the news that they wouldn't be able to deliver the content initially planned, specifically the Hero mode with dedicated talent trees. Overwatch: Invasion is the first wave of the content that remains.

Look, let's all just look surprised, ok? It's no one's fault. As part of this afternoon's Xbox Games Showcase, Atlus revealed its long-requested remake of one of the most iconic and beloved RPGs of all-time, in the form of Persona 3 Reload, which you have never heard of before.
Persona 3 Reload is a full remake of the classic PS2 social-sim-cum-demon-catcher, which wowed western fans in 2006 and took the Shin Megami Tensei brand practically mainstream. The story concerns a party of school students who uncover a temporal anomaly known as "The Dark Hour". The students in question form the "Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad" (SEES), with the aim of getting to the root of the anomaly and the strange creatures that lay within.

Persona 3 was praised for its vivid visual style, attractive and likable cast of characters, and wild soundtrack. The marriage of dungeon-crawler with supah-anime social sim was a huge hit, and would lead to greater success in sequels Persona 4 and Persona 5, as well as an array of multi-genre spin-offs. Fans have been asking for a remake of P3 for many years, and this news will be 100 Christmases for those folks.
Persona 3 Reload launches early 2024. It will arrive on Xbox Game Pass day one.

To make matters worse, he’s completely naked, a fact the shocked beachgoers waste no time bringing to his attention. Your guess is as good as ours as to what trouble the lovable ex-gang enforcer has gotten into this time. 


Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth is scheduled to launch in early 2024 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Its Kiryu-focused prequel, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, was recently confirmed to launch on November 9.]]></summary>

The cheesecake video sees Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga washed up on the shores of what appears to be a Hawaiian beach, unfortunately lacking any clothing whatsoever. Cue a series of typical "Hide the Dick with Objects" jokes. Never gets old. This is clearly the best part of the showcase so far.
Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth is currently in development and will launch early 2024.

The crossover we’ve all been waiting for has finally been announced: The Lucasarts classic is coming to Sea of Thieves as part of its Legend of Monkey Island update.
The Secret of Monkey Island first launched in 1990, and is one of my favorite games of all times. Meanwhile, Sea of Thieves is one of those games that I’ve wanted to get around to, but absolutely haven’t in all the years it’s been available.
https://youtu.be/DOWILvQGVz4
The trailer for Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island shows a group of Scallawags arriving on Melee Island and quickly going on a tour of all the hot spots. They talk to the Voodoo Lady, Stan, and even Guybrush Threepwood himself. They even find their way to Monkey Island and the second biggest monkey head I’ve ever seen!
See that? I’m loaded with Lucasarts references.
Anyway, it’s being promised that “three tall tales” will be added to Sea of Thieves over the span of three months, starting July 20, 2023.

In fact, the official YouTube description reads "best viewed wearing headphones." Enjoy the binaural experience.

Though the new Hellblade 2 trailer provides a release window, it simply confirms the game will launch in 2024. In other words, we'll have to wait to find out when exactly this one will appear. At least we're slowly getting closer to the official debut of Ninja Theory's latest title.
Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will launch on Xbox Series X|S consoles and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Showcase gave us a first meaningful look at Avowed, the upcoming fantasy RPG on the way from the team at Obsidian. The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.
The new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.
Avowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.]]></summary>

Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind hit games like The Outer Worlds, Pentiment, and South Park: The Stick of Truth is taking players to the Living Lands next year in Avowed. During today's Xbox Games Showcase, a new trailer for the game debuted, and it actually managed to pull me in. I'm not the biggest first-person RPG fan, but something about this looks like a hoot.

As previously revealed, Avowed will take place in the same universe as the Pillars of Eternity series. Avowed will release in 2024 and, of course, it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.

The gameplay footage showed Senua exploring a cave of some kind while dealing with her invasive inner voices. If you've played the original game, its oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere is familiar. Senua entered a pool in the cave while the walls shifted in a kaleidoscopic fashion. The footage was impressive in both visuals and performance.
Unfortunately, no specific release date was offered, but it was given a 2024 release window.]]></summary>

The Empire is everywhere. It’s also in Star Wars: Outlaws coming from Ubisoft and Massive in 2024.
As part of the Xbox Games Showcase, we’ve been given a trailer that shows… uh, nothing. I mean, you play as a lady-rogue, who is young, spunky, and wanted by the Empire. She drives a speederbike and has something that looks like a furry axolotl. She also flies what is the ugliest looking ship I’ve seen in the Star Wars Universe, and in a galaxy full of space-pickles, that says a lot.
https://youtu.be/pTcvtSfDkCM
So we’re not given much to go on in terms of what kind of game Star Wars: Outlaws will be. It's apparently open-world. Wait "First open world Star Wars game?" That's absolutely stretching it, Ubisoft.
I’m choosing to believe that this is a crossover between Star Wars and the 1997 LucasArts FPS Outlaws. So, it will be a Star Wars western, which would actually make sense and fit the trailer.
Anyway, we know that Star Wars: Outlaws will be coming to Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2024.

Two trailers into the Xbox showcase and I'm already tired of reading the words "In-Engine Footage." We saw it in the Fable trailer and we saw it in South of Midnight, the upcoming title from Compulsion Games. The studio, best known for the highly questionable We Happy Few, put together a trailer that was 2:30 of pretty much nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Z-8Y8r5ss
It looks great. I love the art direction here and there aren't nearly enough games with a southern gothic setting. Or at least not nearly enough that I've played. But beyond that, what can I say about it? That trailer may be in-engine, but it might as well be pre-rendered for all it did to show us how this game would actually play.
South of Midnight will launch someday in the future, hitting Xbox Game Pass on day one.

A young woman pays a visit to inquire about a dangerous monster, which attempts to ambush her until she retaliates by weaving a seemingly magical web to subdue it. There's no gameplay, and the trailer's description describes South of Midnight as a "fantastical and macabre third-person action-adventure set in the American Deep South."

The Xbox Games Showcase is underway, and the show kicked off with a cinematic for the next title in the Fable franchise, titled, funnily enough, Fable. The trailer starred comedian Richard Ayoade as a vegetable-loving giant, defending his crop from a tiny hero, while musing on the subject of heroism itself.
Unfortunately, there was no gameplay footage, or a date, or much else at all, just in-engine cinematic.
Given the boasts of "in-game trailers", we'll see how the rest of the stream plays out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during the Xbox Showcase, we finally got a look at the open-world Star Wars game Ubisoft has been working on for the last few years. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio known for making The Division and The Division 2. The cinematic reveal trailer didn't show any gameplay, instead relying on cgi cutscenes to set the mood of the world, showing a young woman on the run from a bounty hunter. You can watch it for yourself below.


The description of the trailer on YouTube offers some more concrete details about the game.
"Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars game, set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi," the description says. "Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. Fight, steal, and outwit your way through the galaxy’s crime syndicates as you join the galaxy’s most wanted."
While the new title isn't out until 2024, we'll be learning more about it at Ubisoft's showcase tomorrow. For the full lineup of showcases this month, check out our streaming schedule.]]></summary>

The trailer (but not the full game, presumably) stars Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd fame as Dave commiserating about the age of heroes being over and the age of agriculture being the future. In a twist, however, it is revealed that Ayoade's character is a giant fending off heroes who are trying to invade his home.


From there an action sequence begins with a hero outrunning the giant Ayoade. It is revealed in the end that the hero has defeated the giant by show of them sitting on his shattered glasses. The trailer's description on YouTube shares that this new entry will continue to take place in Albion.

As Summer Game Fest continues, the black-and-green brand is preparing to take the stage, as Microsoft's Xbox brand prepares to regale us with all of the titles headed to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox Game Pass in the remainder of 2023 and beyond — The Xbox Games Showcase is set to kick off in about an hour from now, and we'll be on deck to bring you all of the hot news and updates from today's stream.
https://youtu.be/qGtYn7DCIYo
Xbox has had something of an inauspicious year so far, with the very disappointing launch of Arkane Studios' Redfall and... well, not a whole lot else. As such, Xbox really has to sort of knock it out of the park tonight, showing its best hand to its dedicated customers and hoping to encourage them to fill up their MS store wishlists. This isn't to say that there aren't plenty of fine multiplatform titles headed to the platform, but it would neat to see Team Spencer drop a couple of "Killer Apps" today, as they say.
You can also watch along with Destructoid's own Brett Medlock and Mary Stowe below!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsLS_0WI5kY&ab_channel=Destructoid
The Xbox Games Showcase starts at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST and is expected to run around two hours... They always run around two hours. You can watch the stream in the embed below, and Team Destructoid will be on board to bring you the headlines. Oh, and if you're looking forward to Starfield, then stay tuned after the main show, as Bethesda will be presenting a special showcase of the sci-fi epic.

Yet, the entirety of my time with Mortal Kombat 1 had me desperate for an equivalent to Street Fighter 6's modern control scheme: a simplified remap of the buttons which enables anyone to hop in and do cool moves.

Since Cocoon’s reveal last year, I’ve been excited to one day check it out. Coming from Jeppe Carlsen, a former lead designer behind Playdead’s Limbo and Inside, its reveal trailer in 2022 made splashes amongst fans of the games Carlsen worked on. During Summer Games Fest this year, I finally got to play roughly 30 minutes of this strange, sci-fi puzzle game, and I don’t think it could have made a better first hands-on impression. 
Immediately, Cocoon’s visual style is striking. Its minimalist sci-fi aesthetic feels right at home within the lineage of Playdead games, although it’s import…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can this really hold up on Nintendo's platform?
Against all odds, Mortal Kombat 11 turned out pretty well on the Nintendo Switch. Like many ports from the PS4 and Xbox One, there was always a concern that Netherrealm Studio’s cinematic fighter wouldn’t be able to cut it on Nintendo’s hybrid console. Still, with 60fps performance and all the content you could possibly want, it proved to be a more-than-competent option for Switch owners.
Its direct sequel and semi-reboot, Mortal Kombat 1, aims to crank everything up a couple of notches, boasting stunning visuals and an expanded combat system that lets you call in additional ‘Kameo’ fighters to assist you in battle. After the gameplay reveal at Summer Game Fest, we managed to go hands-on with Netherrealm’s latest effort for roughly 30 minutes and came away utterly gobsmacked. And, honestly? It makes us worried about the Switch version.

        <updated>2023-06-10T19:36:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy classic 3D platformers and games that let you creatively tinker with their worlds, you may want to put Ruffy and the Riverside on your radar. This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.
As Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. 


In addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bubbly fun
Foamstars feels a bit out of left field for Square Enix. A multiplayer shooter may not be all that strange; after all, the publisher did make a battle royale based on Final Fantasy VII. But this isn't a straightforward shooter. Foamstars features stylish fighters rather than grizzled warriors and suds instead of bullets.
We had a chance to play Foamstars at Summer Game Fest 2023, getting in a decent number of matches. The easiest comparison point for the game is Splatoon, and not just due to the vicious, viscous warfare waged on each of their battlefields. Both games look at territory as an important factor in winning the day and see the firepower you employ as both utility and knockout power. That said, some similarities are a little obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Future Games Show closed out with a new trailer for The Spirit of the Samurai, an eye-catching stop-motion 2D Metroidvania-style action game coming next year.


The game’s striking stop-motion presentation immediately stands out, paying homage to the classic model animation of Ray Harryhausen films, such as Mighty Joe Young, Jason and the Argonauts, and Clash of the Titans. Players guide three very different characters – a samurai, a Kodama spirit, and a cat – on a journey to save Japan from invading Oni. As the samurai Takeshi and the much smaller Kodoma, you’ll hack apart undead soldiers and supernatural foes from Japanese mythology. As the cat, platforming and stealth are the names of the game, as you’ll avoid enemies such as one, particularly toothy and terrifying-looking demon. 
The Spirit of the Samurai has been in the works for a few years by developer Digital Mind Games and arrives in 2024 for PC.]]></summary>

Having been out for the best part of a month now, we think it's fair to say that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is going to be one of those games where we never stop discovering new things.
In our playthroughs so far, these discoveries have had us grinning cheek to cheek on a pretty consistent basis, but that hasn't stopped the smiles from being wiped from our faces as we stumble across some game-changing mechanic at the 100-hour mark.

Unfortunately for the developer Ubisoft Montpellier (known for its work on Rayman Legends), Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown hasn't got off to the best start. VGC reports it has received a "mostly negative reception" online - with more 'dislikes' than 'likes' on the official YouTube video reveals combined.

If you're of a certain vintage you may just about remember being thoroughly impressed with the graphical prowess of Starbreeze Studios' Enclave when it first released on the original Xbox all the way back in 2002.
Starbreeze was about to have a great big Vin Diesel-shaped success in the form of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay — a game we'd love to see on Switch — but, before that, the developer brought us this third-person action RPG that gave players both light and dark paths to walk in two story-based campaigns set in the world of Calenheim.

Ahead of the launch of Sonic Origins Plus later this month, Sega has officially lifted the lid on the multiplayer platformer Sonic Superstars. It transports Sonic and his friends to a brand new mystical location known as the North Star Islands.
While the gameplay mostly aims to maintain the "classic" feel, the environments will be made up of various "never-before-seen" zones. Speaking to IGN recently, Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka elaborated on this, explaining how players won't be seeing iconic zones like Green Hill or Chemical Plant in this upcoming side-scroller.

Mortal Kombat 1 represents a clean slate for the long-running fighting game franchise just as the story does for its characters. After the cataclysmic events of Mortal Kombat 11 and its story expansion, Liu Kang has assumed the role of the all-powerful fire god. While he created the world with visions of peace, the Mortal Kombat characters do what they do best in relatively short order, and the blood starts splattering once again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. PS: we made a mistake in the Windows release; a 13.2.1 was pushed to address this issue. It is fully network compatible with 13.2, so no need to update unless you want to. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

Last year’s Sonic Frontiers brought Sega’s mascot some much-needed success in the 3D gaming realm, but outside of some segments in the 3D adventures and the externally developed Sonic Mania, the 2D side of the Sonic franchise has been grossly underserviced in recent years. Announced yesterday, Sonic Superstars hopes to give that corner of the Sonic gaming universe a shot in the arm, delivering gorgeous HD visuals, four-player cooperative play, and a bevy of unique Emerald Powers.
However, the announcement was met with a dose of skepticism, as, for many, it immediately conjured memories…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years wallowing in purgatory, 2011's Shadow of the Damned is getting another shot in the limelight via a remaster. On top of that, developer Grasshopper Manufacture is holding its own E3-style presentation next week.
Shadows of the Damned was the product of a collaboration between Grasshopper's Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), who wrote the game, and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami, who served as a producer. It's a third-person shooter about demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who must rescue his girlfriend after she's abducted by the forces of the underworld with the help of his trusty phallic-joke loving demon, Johnson. The game's bombastic, supernatural action and absurd sense of humor made it generally well-liked upon release (We scored it a 9.25 out of 10 in our review), but it has never been ported beyond its original platforms on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's about to change.


The humorous trailer doesn't reveal any details about the remaster, but we'll likely learn more at the inaugural Grasshopper Direct on June 14. The event celebrates the studios 25th anniversary and kicks off at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET, so fans in the U.S. will have to brew an extra cup of coffee if they want to catch the event live. 
Are you a fan of Shadows of the Damned or does this remaster entice you to give it a shot? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals feels like returning to a familiar place in a great way. I’ve known about the sequel for a couple of years – since Night School Studio announced it in 2021 – but it wasn’t until I went hands-on with it during Summer Games Fest that it dawned on me just how long it’s been since Oxenfree first came out. 
In that seven-year gap, I immediately notice that Oxenfree II is even more beautiful than its predecessor, an already pretty game thanks to its unique visual style. That aesthetic returns, but it pops even more on screen. N…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Internet provider RCN and several major music companies are exploring options to settle their piracy liability dispute. A mediator was assigned this week to help the parties reach a deal but the same can't be said about a lawsuit filed against the ISP by a group of filmmakers. That battle only appears to have intensified, with a new law firm and evidence provider joining the case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday the 13th: The Game is being delisted from storefronts at the end of the year due to an expiring license. 
A statement from the game's official Twitter account explains that the asymmetric multiplayer slasher title will be removed from retail and digital storefronts once the license expires on December 31st. However, the game will still be playable for those who own it through at least the following year, meaning up to December 31, 2024. Until then, the base price of the game will be dropped to $4.99, and each piece of DLC will cost $0.99.

Friday the 13th: The Game pits a team of players controlling Camp Crystal Lake counselors working together to survive against a player-controlled Jason Voorhees. The game didn’t arrive to the warmest reception when it launched in 2017, but it’s always a bummer to see games disappear, especially when it's at the mercy of IP licensing. Even before this final blow, the game had a rocky existence due to legal disputes with the film's original creators halting the distribution of DLC and, later, the eventual shutdown of its dedicated servers. 
What did you think of Friday the 13th: The Game? Will you be picking it up before it leaves storefronts? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

To my great surprise, it wasn't the Rogue, which is currently sitting at the top of our tier list. Rather, it's the Sorcerer, which currently sits at the bottom of our class rankings. Presumably, everyone loves watching ice shards and lightning bolts leave their fingertips. So, is the majority of Diablo 4's player-base wrong, or are we?

The satirical Soviet posters and propaganda reels are here, but used sparingly, and more convincingly than the usual "Russia, haha! Vodka! lol!" fare, and although all its parts are fairly familiar, Kvark feels distinct enough that I had a hard time actually putting it down.

The bomb itself looks like a fruit — or maybe a Pikmin that's still buried — and when it dissolves in the water, you'll find one of five Pikmin in the centre. You'll need to save it from drowning, then! Unless it's the Blue Pikmin, of course...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like lots of people in the RPS Treehouse right now, I've been squeezing in bits of Diablo 4 around the various Summer Game Fest streams happening this week. I'm having a decent, if mildly monotonous time so far, mostly because I haven't unlocked all my Druid's abilities just yet, but I'm keen to keep going with it, mostly because I just like turning into a bear and a wolf every three seconds to whack some evil skelly boys, innit. When I was logging off the other day, though, I had a fleeting glance at Diablo 4's shop. Not to actually buy anything, I should stress. I'm not one for cosmetics in any shape or form. But I just wanted to see what ludicrous things it was trying to sell me for real human money. And one item for sale was, of course, some fancy horse armour, and it cost six English pounds and thirty nine pence. £6.39! For a mangey rope bridle and a bone dagger on its side! (You can see it in the header image up top there). Ridiculous, I exclaimed, and promptly shut down my PC. 
The next morning, I was talking about this daft bit of armour with the RPS Treehouse when Alice0 suddenly introduced me to the weird and wonderful world of cheap horse games on Steam. After all, why spend upwards of £6 on a pointless cosmetic item when you could feasibly put that money toward 6 whole horse games that have actually dozens of horses in them? So join me as we discover how many horse games you can buy on Steam for the same price as Diablo 4's horse armour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's impossible to determine just how long ago 2014 was. Wisdom would dictate it sits around the 9 year mark, but no one truly believes that. Endless Legend? That was no more than two years ago, and I'll throw hands if anyone suggests otherwise. But apparently enough time has passed that just about every 4X game that came out that year has now been superceded by a newer title in the series. Civilization: Beyond Earth, Galactic Civilizations 3, Age Of Wonders 3, and Endless Legend made 2014 an incredibly strong year for strategy games, but nowadays, who really still plays these older entries?
I don't mean to sound derisive. It's a sombre truth. At 233 hours, I've put more time into Endless Legend than any other 4X strategy game in my Steam library, and loved every minute of it. To this day it's still the best in the genre when it comes to sparking the imagination of my chronically fantasy-loving brain. The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly. It's a simply splendid game. The question is whether it's still worth playing today.

Wave one of this sale is now live, with the second wave set to add even more games on 15th June. There are over 1,500 titles seeing a discount in this period, so we can't do as we usually do and list every available discount as you would be scrolling forever. What we have done, however, is pull out some of the biggest titles currently on sale and listed them below.

In 2018, it was caught up in the dispute between the original film's producer and writer, causing publisher Gun Media to halt all DLC plans. In 2020, the game's dedicated servers were killed, but online play limped on via peer-to-peer matchmaking.

I always lose interest at some point and start a new civilisation because I mostly want to try out new weird ideas for a new weird empire, not actually rule that empire and fight its endgame wars. That makes me mighty interested in Stellaris Nexus, an upcoming turn-based spin-off which aims to offer a full multiplayer 4X experience in under an hour.

You wear clothes that expose your unchristian knees and you eat a lot of ice cream, for which you should self-flagellate, and so on. Fittingly, sequel to unabashedly Catholic-y Metroidvania Blasphemous is out on August 24th, as revealed in a trailer at tonight's Summer Game Fest. Blasphemous 2, which was only revealed back in April, looks to be similar to the fist game, i.e. it's a side-scrolling Soulslike drenched in the most bloody and grim Christian imagery you can think of. Category is: Holy See.

In this week of oh so many announcements, you can't blame anyone for getting carried away and jumping the gun. Unfortunately for Persona developers Atlus, it seems they accidentally announced two games earlier than intended. Eagle-eyed fans say Atlus's Instagram today posted trailers for Persona 3 Reload, a remake of the 2006 RPG, and grid-based tactics spin-off Persona 5 Tactica. While they're no longer on the Insta, folks say they've saved the trailers so you can see them too.

Quite frankly, it was an hour or so of straight bangers ranging from mind-bending puzzlers to Pokémon-likes to emotionally charged shepherders.
While there's some familiar names in the pack like Hyper Light Drifter and Cocoon, there's a whole host of surprises in there. And that's thanks to the folks over at Double Fine Productions, iam8bit, and PlayStation's indie champion Greg Rice who put all of this together for us to enjoy each year. Below, I've rounded up all the announcements so you can absorb them through your eyeballs and let them rattle around your head until launch.

Chaotic puzzler Human: Fall Flat is getting a sequel and it looks to be just as much of a riot as the first one. Aptly named Human Fall Flat 2 (minus the colon), it looks like this follow-up will take place on different construction sites - the safest of places on Earth for slapstick and silliness to run free. There's not much we can glean from the short trailer that debuted during the Devolver Showcase at this year's Summer Game Fest, but you can have a watch for yourself below.

The idea of being the sovereign of a kingdom and having to make difficult decisions makes me crumble quicker than a piece of shortbread in a cup of tea.

Announced during this year's Summer Game Fest, this follow-up looks equally as tense and you can feast your eyes (or cover them in horror) on the trailer below.

It seems to have been one of those things where a few years back a bunch of devs all noticed that there hadn't been one for a while, but didn't realise they weren't the only ones to have noticed until the games all started coming out. Anyway, Saber Interactive revealed John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, to be published by Focus Entertainment, at tonight's Summer Game Fest. It's an 80s-inspired FPS for up to four players, and you shoot a bunch of zombs.

Coming in that old favourite release window of "fall 2023", Free Range Games' Dwarf 'em up brought its first gameplay trailer to Summer Game Fest tonight, and we saw not only some examples of the building you can do on your quest to - hear me out - Return To Moria, but also the monsters that can emerge from the deep to stop you doing it.

This year's Summer Games Fest-adjacent live stream was no exception with updates on titles we're already excited about (like Hyper Light Breaker), new game announcements from developers with impressive resumes (like Beastieball), and completely new experiences that we can't wait to get our hands on (like Helskate). You can see everything that was announced and shown below.

Beastieball
Beastieball has a simple premise: what if, instead of battling, Pokémon just wanted to play volleyball? In this turn-based RPG, explore an open world, befriend monsters called Beasties, and recruit them to your Beastieball team. Beasties have relationships with each other as well, gaining acc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past three months, I've been gasping to tell someone about the next game from the makers of Mutazione. I got to see a sneak peak of it back in March at GDC, but I've been sworn to secrecy ever since. But at long last, Saltsea Chronicles has made its debut at tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, and I can finally unburden myself and let out 90 days' worth of fizz pop excitement for this gorgeous new adventure game. 
Set on a flooded, post-apocalyptic Earth, creative director Hannah Nicklin described it to me like this: "What if you were watching Star Trek, but you get to choose where they go, who's on the adventure and what they get to say?" It's a tantalising premise, especially when it's all packaged up in the same crisp, pastel colour palette as the perpetually stunning Mutazione. The Star Trek reference isn't just for show, either. You might only be visiting different islands rather than whole planets during the course of Saltsea Chronicles, but it does have a natty, Alexander Courage-grade theme tune that plays between its chapters. The most exciting thing about this oceanic trek, however, is its incredibly cool save system that lets you dip in and out of different story branches to explore different paths and opportunities as you see fit. Let me tell you all about it.

Seeing him back in action in a new trailer for the upcoming Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, aw, I wish Sega had let Kiryu retire. My poor dad earned it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time back I made fun of the preview for Immortals Of Aveum because a) it was quite a silly hands-off preview and b) Immortals Of Aveum is very clearly a game that needs to be played to properly get to grips with it. It's out on July 20th, so not too far away. Have I played it yet? No! Of course not! But we're getting closer to a hands on, and after a six-minute video of the magic FPS in action last month, tonight's Summer Game Fest threw us a big, bombastic boss fight on top of a steampunk Jaeger, or something. I dunno, it was hard to tell over the light show. Those sure are a lot of magical fireworks going off. I like it. Jangle some more keys in front of me, games man.

The video itself is, uh, well, it's not long, and it's quite choppy. While I enjoy a good setpiece, my concerns remain the same as before, i.e. the magic shooting, despite the different flavours of magic broadly corresponding to a different kind of gun, looks pretty weightless, and the enemies look bullet spongey. I do like the colours and the traversal, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest concluded with the first big look at Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the next chapter of Final Fantasy VII Remake. A lenghty trailer gave us some good looks at its gameplay, story, as well as a much-anticipated release window. 
The story sees Cloud and the gang explore beyond Midgar to stop Sephiroth’s plans, and we see looks at the grander Final Fantasy VII story, likely to be laden with new twists. In terms of new faces, get to see Elena join Reno and Rude in the Turks, and Yuffie, the fiery Wutai ninja introduced in the Intermission story expansion, officially joins the party. 


Perhaps the most surprising revelation is that Rebirth will come on two discs. Given how much storage a single Blu-ray can hold, that suggests that Rebirth could be a mammoth-sized experience, which is wild given that it’s only Part 2 of a planned trilogy of games. We also now know that Rebirth is coming in early 2024 exclusively to PlayStation 5.]]></summary>

Lake told us a little bit more about said agent Saga Anderson, leading into a first glimpse of "raw gameplay" (as opposed to cooked?) that showed her in action. I have to say, my first impression is that Saga is a terrible FBI agent who is going to ruin the chain of evidence if this ever goes to court because this woman will not put on gloves to handle a goddamn thing.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2023/2023/06/08/heres-your-first-look-at-like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name"/>
        <updated>2023-06-08T20:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Summer Games Fest, we got our first extended look at gameplay for Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
As previously revealed, Gaiden takes place between the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon, filling in the gaps of what longtime series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma was up to after faking his own death in the former before reappearing in the latter. 
From the looks of it, Kiryu, now being called "Codename Joryu," has been running jobs for a mysterious someone. As you might expect, this mainly means he's beating the holy hell out of dudes in the street. The trailer shows a variety of large-scale fights, as well as Kiryu's new fighting abilities, which include a rope-type weapon he can use to bring items and people closer to him.
Check out the trailer below:


As pointed out by Gematsu, Gaiden gameplay details actually leaked yesterday on the PlayStation Store. Here are some of the key details:
"Dynamically switch between the Yakuza and Agent fighting styles in visceral melee combat.
"With the Yakuza style, strike fear into enemies by unleashing wildly aggressive moves powered by Kiryu’s unparalleled strength and flair.
"Or up the ante with the Agent style by delivering blows with absolute speed and precision, while using an array of high-tech gadgets like electrified bind wires to stun enemies then send them flying.
"Strategically adapt to the situation and leverage both styles to dominate and destroy hordes of enemies."
"Whether you’re brawling in the secret Castle arena, singing a new karaoke song, enjoying a drink at the live-action cabaret club, or racing in the pocket circuit, the world offers a variety of immersive experiences.
"An intriguing informant named Akame also provides thrilling sub-missions, drawing you into an epic showdown that unfolds the more you explore and enjoy Sotenbori, Yokohama and the mysterious Castle."
Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will be released on November 9, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sick of losing cubes in Marvel Snap? This newest game mode might be the solution to your problems. Today during Summer Game Fest, Second Dinner's Chief Development Officer Ben Brode took to the stage to announce that Conquest, Marvel Snap's newest mode, will launch on June 13. The news was accompanied by a promotional skit featuring SungWon Cho, who you might recognize as Ratatoskr from God of War: Ragnarök. You can watch the trailer below.


Conquest Mode works similarly to Marvel Snap's Battle Mode. Two players are matched up for a series of games, each with ten units of health. Instead of wagering cubes, the currency players use to gain levels in the standard ranked mode, Conquest will have players wagering health. Unlike Battle Mode, which ends as soon as one player runs out of health, Conquest has players progress through tiers of competition, requiring longer winning streaks the higher they get. As a reward for making it to the top, players will receive exclusive cosmetics.
“It’s just insane how good players have gotten at Marvel Snap since we launched in the fall," Brode said in a press release. "For our most competitive, high-skilled players, we wanted to give them the ultimate challenge with Conquest. Players can now find out who truly is the best of the best and worthy of ultimate Marvel Snap glory!! What’s also super cool about Conquest is that the Proving Grounds can double as a great way to try out new decks, as Conquest has no impact on a player's Marvel Snap season rank."
Marvel Snap recently started its "Spider-Versus" season, which will introduce new cards such as Ghost-Spider, Spider-Ham, and Silk. The game is currently available on PC and Mobile devices and made it onto the list of our top ten games of 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoenix Labs, the studio behind Dauntless, unveiled a much different project in the form of Fae Farm last year. As the name suggests, it's a cozy farming simulator that adds spellcasting to the mix, and a new trailer premiering during Summer Game Fest revealed it is launching on September 8.
Fae Farm takes place in the magical realm of Azoria, which requires your green thumb to help restore it to its former glory. That means tilling the land to grow crops, gathering resources by exploring, and decorating your homesteads both inside and out. You can farm alone or enlist help by inviting friends in online multiplayer (as well as locally on Switch). Check out some of the activities the game offers in the gameplay trailer video below.


Fae Farm will be available on Switch and PC via Steam and The Epic Game Store.]]></summary>

While we didn't get any new gameplay footage, we got two new pieces of concept art featuring the game's main villains, Kraven and Venom.
Venom was revealed in the original trailer for Spider-Man 2, but we didn't see anything more than his face at the very end. This art is our first look at Insomniac's take on the character. When asked about his identity, Intihar would only say that it was not Eddie Brock, leaving the man inside the symbiote a mystery. But if you've played 2018's Spider-Man, you've probably got a good guess as to who's inside. For the full interview, check out the video below.


Additionally, we got an official release date. You can check out a map twice as big as the last with twice the web-slingers when Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launches on PS5 on October 20, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios clearly wanted another easily detestable bad guy for Baldur’s Gate 3, so it turned to Harry Potter’s Lucius Malfoy to play one of the game's newly revealed antagonists. 
That would be actor Jason Isaacs, who portrayed the father of Harry Potter rival Draco Malfoy in the films. Isaacs will take the role of Lord Enver Gortash, designer of the Steel Watchers, magical warriors tasked with protecting Baldur’s Gate after Duke Ravengard vanishes. Players will bump heads with this powerful enforcer as they find themselves in the middle of a power struggle engulfing the city. You can see his introduction in the trailer below. 


"It was a thrill to join the Baldur’s Gate universe but I fear that the magnificent Lord Enver Gortash is being mischaracterized as a villain," says Isaacs in a press release. "In a brutal world of betrayals and butchery, he’s learned to lie better and backstab first. The joy in voicing him - apart from the obvious pleasure in getting to look so glorious - was that the creative team and I got to play loose enough to find ways that he could enjoy the ride and make the players hate him more!"
Isaac isn’t the only famous name players will encounter. J.K. Simmons (Portal 2's Cave Johnson, Spider-Man's J. Jonah Jameson) was previously revealed as General Ketheric Thorm. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 launches on August 31 for PlayStation 5 and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld has always seemed too good to be true, given its vibrant world and amazingly absurd premise of inserting guns and survival features into a Pokémon-inspired open-world game. After a long wait, fans will finally get to try it for themselves early next year.
Developer Pocketpair revealed during Summer Game Fest that Palworld is launching in Steam Early Access in January. A long wait to be sure (especially since the game was last slated to enter Early Access this year), but we'll take any proof that this game is a real thing because it continues to look bonkers. 


Palworld takes place in a world where players can catch and befriend cute, legally-distinct monsters called Pals. The game features an open world that supports multiplayer (up to 8 players) where you can have Pals give a helping hand in battles or in exploration, put them to work making resources in your factories, sell them off, or just eat them. Combat unfolds as a third-person shooter with players wielding assault weapons and other guns to blast enemy Pals and other threats, or you can use Pal’s unique abilities to get the job done. In multiplayer, you can explore together, trade Pals, or steal each other's monsters and items in battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 got its first unedited gameplay showing during Summer Game Fest, with Remedy head Sam Lake divulging more details on the upcoming survival horror title.
Sam Lake offered further details on previously revealed factoids about Alan Wake 2. The game lets you play as Alan and newcomer FBI agent Saga, who each sport separate but connected campaigns. Players can switch between the two at any time, with Saga exploring the pacific northwest while Alan tries to escape the Dark Place. Since players can change characters freely, this opens up a plethora of storytelling differences; you can even play the full game as one character if you choose. 
The sequel’s shift to pure survival horror is shown off with the game’s heavy Resident Evil vibes as Saga riddles a terrifying killer with bullets while dodging his attacks. The trailer ends with some investigative gameplay, but we don’t get a long look at this part of the experience.


Alan Wake 2 launches on October 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via The Epic Game Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Summer Game Fest gave us a first look at Sand Land, the new game from Bandai Namco, based on a manga by celebrated artist, Akira Toriyama.
The new game boasts a gorgeous art style that is unmistakably rooted in Toriyama’s style, and seems to mix action, vehicles, and fighting game mechanics together to tell a story set in a mysterious desert world.
It’s unknown at this point if the game will follow the same thread as the original manga. If it does, the story will follow a former general named Sheriff Rao as he tries to overcome a corrupt king with the help of the demon prince Beelzebub and his friend Thief. The three work together (including stealing a tank) to bring water back to a parched world.
There’s still much to learn about the video game adaptation, but the announcement trailer looked beautiful. Sand Land is headed to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but no word yet on release date.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-08T19:41:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Sonic Team have announced Sonic Superstars, a new 2D adventure starring the company's Blue Blur. Though Sonic is the star, as the name implies, there are plenty of supporting cast members. In this reveal trailer, we also see Tails, Knuckles, and Amy appear as playable characters, each with their own unique abilities.
For the first time since Sonic Adventure, original Sonic the Hedgehog designer and artist Naoto Ohshima returns to the franchise. As the original designer of the Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman characters, he will bring an all-new character to the franchise through Sonic Superstars. 
Sonic Superstars also introduces seven different Emerald Powers. In the trailer, we see Sonic create clones of himself and climb waterfalls, but the press release also teases "powering up." 
Taking place on the North Star Islands, Sonic Superstars purports to deliver never-before-seen environments, hinting that, despite the compilation-style name, we will be speeding through all new levels instead of the usual suspects like Green Hill and Chemical Plant. The press release teases enormous creatures and evil plans from Dr. Eggman, while Fang the Sniper (AKA Nack the Weasel) from Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic the Fighters, and other games seems to appear as a secondary enemy.
In the trailer, we also see what look to be Special Stages that borrow from the rotating Special Stages from Sonic 1, plus a 3D Special Stage. The modernized HD graphics look great in motion, but the proof will be in how it plays, particularly following how disappointed many in the community were by Sonic the Hedgehog 4. If Sonic Team is able to nail the physics, momentum, and overall feel, Sonic Superstars could do for the 2D Sonic series what New Super Mario Bros. did for the 2D Mario series.
Sonic Superstars releases both digitally and physically for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC this fall, and will start at $60.]]></summary>

"This trailer is literally insane," Keighley warned. Looks like Mortal Kombat to me, though I'm honestly I'm quite curious about this semi-fresh start, especially after heading that Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as the series' moviestar murderman, Johnny Cage. Have a look, though, you know, be warned: literally insane.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
