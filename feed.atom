Most of us have some childhood memory of games – be it Pokémon Blue, Tetris, or Super Mario Bros. When we dust off those old consoles, the games often trigger memories of our lives outside the screen too.
In his heart-wrenching series of poems, If All the World and Love Were Young, Stephen Sexton put this idea poetic into practice. Published in 2019, the book ties one of his most difficult experiences, his mother’s illness and passing, to his favourite game, Super Mario World.

Never has a bad game asked me for so much commitment.
Blame The Industry’s Chris Moyse. It was his suggestion. Considering he’s the leading expert on all things fists, I trust him when he tells me a fighting game is going to be bad. And Fighter Maker is… Well, maybe not bad, but it’s extremely misguided.

Summer has finally hit Blighty, bringing with it a face-melting heatwave and those Sticky, Sticky Nights that Kiss never sang about. I'm here for it, frankly, as it saves on heating bills and helps my body shed the excesses of meat. Of course, it makes sitting in the office writing about games a little uncomfortable, but as long as I have an excuse to eat ice-cream, I'll take it.
And speaking of Summer, we have reached the end of Summer Game Fest, just in time to start gearing up for Gamescom. Because now E3 is no longer around, these things roll out for weeks, and weeks, and weeks.

After this week, we think it's fair to say that showcase season is well and truly upon us.
Coming off the back of Summer Game Fest, a collection of our brilliant writers came together to give their hands-on impressions of a boatload of games coming to Switch including the excellent Metroidvania Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, spooky sequel OXENFREE II: Lost Signals and the much-anticipated Sonic Superstars — which we reckon is "exactly what Sonic 4 should have been".

At the Xbox Games Showcase, Atlus announced two new Persona games. Just days later they were confirmed for multiple other platforms. A Switch version of Persona 5 Tactica was included in this reveal, but at the time there was no mention of Persona 3 Reload for the hybrid platform.
Fortunately, there still might be a chance. After a placeholder box art for a Switch was discovered last weekend, it seems another listing for Nintendo's hybrid platform has now popped up, this time via the online retailer Playasia - with an image of a "preliminary picture". This was highlighted by a fan via the Nintendo Switch subreddit:

It felt like we weren’t going to see a sequel to 2021’s Fuga: Melodies of Steel. For starters, it ended rather conclusively. It also only sold modestly, and it feels like Cyberconnect has been trying unsuccessfully to get the Little Tail Bronx series to take off since Tail Concerto in 1998. Yet, here we are, with Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2.
I couldn’t be happier. The original Fuga was a surprisingly well-executed design that got a lot of mileage from what could be considered very simple mechanics. So, how do you expand on that? What can you do to improve what has already been polished to such a gloss?
Not much, I guess.

Getting into the Metal Max series has been one of the most exciting experiences to come my way in this hobby recently. I picked up Metal Max Xeno Reborn on a whim, and the next thing I know, I’m hungrily trying to consume everything from the series I could get my hands on. That’s unfortunately not a lot. Most of the series has never left Japan. While there are some fan translations landing for some of those titles, there was only one official release for the series in North America before Metal Max Xeno. That was 2005’s Metal Saga on PS2.
Don’t let the name fool you. This isn’t some spin-off. Metal Saga is a whole-fat entry in the series. There were some trademark issues resulting from Data East going bankrupt, so the developers at Crea-tech couldn’t actually call it Metal M…]]></summary>

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

The first Remnant: From the Ashes felt like a surprise. Its strange mix of Souls-like framing, Eldritch horrors, and third-person action-shooter made for something a bit different that kept players going back for more. Gunfire Games is trying to do more of the same with Remnant 2, and from what I've played, it's working.
If you've played the first Remnant, then Remnant 2 will feel very familiar. It's still a third-person shooter set in strange worlds, inhabited by aggressive horrors. You can run it solo or with a friend, and randomization keeps things fresh. In my demo at Summer Game Fest 2023, I got a little cocky; some of the early areas felt easy, compared to what I'd played of the first Remnant. As a solo runner, I blasted through them.

Bethesda didn't have a whole lot going on beyond Starfield at Summer Game Fest this year, but we did get a brief look at Fallout 76's next update: Atlantic City. Although the trailer noted that it was "coming soon," there's more coming to Fallout 76 in the form of smaller content and quality of life patches. In a new Inside the Vault blog post, we have more info on the lead-up to that bigger Atlantic City update.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj0ealG9ftI
Next up for Fallout 76 is Season 13 and the Once in a Blue Moon update
It feels like forever ago that I covered the first Fallout 76 season in mid-2020, but here we are, awaiting lucky Season 13.
Bethesda confirms that Season 13 is titled "Shoot for the Stars," and is slated to contain the following:
New CAMP items like the western movie set, director's chair, and studio camera
New armor paints including "stuntman" marine and secret service ensembles
A new ally named Joey Bello, who is a "wise-cracking stand-up comedian from Atlantic City" (this is the part I'm most interested in)
Of course, bug fixes (that address issues added in the last update no doubt) are coming too.
On June 20 at 9AM ET, the Once in a Blue Moon update will launch in tandem with the Season 13 kickoff, which adds more quests, enemies, rewards, and Daily Ops.

Here's a roadmap for everything Fallout 76 related from June to September
The other big part of the blog post involves a new roadmap for June through September, which contains the following big content highlights:
June - Patch 44: Once in a Blue Moon (Season 13, Community CAMP Creations: Fortification)
July - Patch 45 (Community CAMP Creations: Movies)
August - Patch 46 (United We Stand, CAMP Creations: Summer)
September - Community Camp Creations: Shelters

I've experienced many joys throughout my life, but playing Halo in high school and making my own LAN cable is a top 10 moment. When Infection (humans vs. zombies) was introduced to the series, it came close. Now it's coming back in Halo Infinite, and the development team over at 343 Industries has given us a lot of info to chew on while we wait for its return.
What is Infection mode in Halo?
Introduced in Halo 2 and carried on throughout the series (well, until the launch of Infinite), Infection is a two-team mode that pits humans against a team of zombies. This quick summation from 343 does a great job of explaining why it was such a hit:

For a certain sort of Elder Scrolls player, it’s the only way to travel through a fantasy open world - perma-crouched, bow stretched lazily across the lower third of the screen. And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.
“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one. I’m pretty sure what goes into these.”

Based on a French novel by Boris Vian, this tells a strange and surprisingly dark story about a famously handsome young himbo who gets caught up in a sinister plot in 1950s Los Angeles and has to adventure, talk, fight, and - horrors - reason his way to the truth. It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.

In case you're wondering: yes, this entry is also called Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade. As it arrived in 2003 on the GBA, Blazing Blade was the first entry that was localized outside of Japan and helped put the series on the map worldwide. As such, it had that bit of weird '90s localization nomenclature, and was brought over as "Fire Emblem."

The Phantom Limb from Venture Bros. explained to someone that “The Mona Lisa isn’t a better painting, merely a more famous painting.” It’s a quote that is an effectively concise way of explaining that something being mainstream is not necessarily an indicator of its quality. In the realm of video games, it is particularly useful, as the hyper-commercialized nature of it ensures that the cream doesn’t always rise to the top. Year after year, my favorite games are rarely the ones that are considered the period’s “big releases,” and that isn’t because I’m a snob. Sorry, I mean, that isn’t solely because I’m a snob.
2021’s Fuga: Melodies of Steel is an example of that. I personally overlooked the game for a couple of reasons. The first is that it didn’t get a whole lot …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious players can get their hands on Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders for the first time via a closed alpha later this month. 
On June 29, the PvPvE extraction shooter will get its first test out in the wild, so to speak. You’ll have to sign up on Steam to participate in the alpha, and a new trailer provides some fresh (pre-alpha) gameplay clips. 


ARC Raiders made its big debut at The Game Awards in 2021 and was originally pitched as a co-op PvE experience about players working together to battle invading alien machines. It had been slated to launch last year before Embark delayed the game in order to focus on finishing up its other upcoming free-to-play team shooter, The Finals (which has a second playable beta running now until June 21). Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. 
Embark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Did 2020's summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It's probably a horror game set in space. Doesn't that look great? Now let's take a look at the first game by a new studio comprised of ex-Bioware devs.


Yep, that's right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I've commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.
The tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.

Sometimes it's difficult to know what's going on at Twitch at any given time. On one hand, the streaming platform has made attempts to remove hate groups. On the other, it's also been embroiled in a series of controversies. This is especially true when it comes to the streamers themselves.
However, there is some good news on the horizon, as it turns out that the Amazon-owned company is increasing its revenue split, returning to the old 70/30 divide. The new program is being referred to as "Partner Plus." But before you start celebrating, there are a few provisos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has announced Absurd Ventures, his new studio. 
Houser was Rockstar's vice president when he announced in 2020 that he was leaving the company behind franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. At the time of the announcement, Houser revealed that he had taken an extended break starting in the spring of 2019. His last day at Rockstar, which he co-founded with his brother Sam Houser in 1998, was March 11. 
Now, three years later, Houser has revealed Absurd Ventures. This studio is focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts."


It sounds quite ambitious and while Absurd Venture's official website features all kinds of visuals showcasing its style, there's nothing official in terms of projects announced at this time.

Unlike Carn's Barbarian, Quin69's Druid wasn't level 100 yet, but he was pretty darn close at level 91. His Druid had 172 hours and 50 minutes of play time. That's more than a week's worth of playing and the game's only been out for 10 days (or 15, if we're including early access).

Back in 2020, Dan Houser left Rockstar following a long hiatus. Being the driving force behind the stories of Grand Theft Auto 5, both Red Dead Redemption games and Max Payne 3 means his absence could lead to some changes for future titles from the GTA developer. That said, seeing as the company has yet to release a new game since his departure, we can't really know for sure.
However, Houser is back with his new company, Absurd Ventures. According to a report from Polygon, this outfit will give the writer and producer a new outlet for some upcoming projects. In a press release, Houser said that he and his team are "building Absurd Ventures to create new universes and to tell great stories, wherever and however we can."
https://youtu.be/n5-9SeQjAEc
Just what the studio actually has in mind will be the topic of much discussion going forward, no doubt. You can have a look at the Absurd Ventures website for some faint clues, though there's very little there to say about what's in the pipeline. There's also a video promoting the company, but it's a series of bizarre imagery that really leaves more questions than answers. We'll just have to wait to see what the studio conjures up, but given the name that's attached, it's going to be of interest to a lot of people.
Along with his brother Sam, Dan Houser is responsible for one of the biggest franchises in gaming history via the Rockstar brand. Grand Theft Auto began life in 1997, with Dan being credited as either writer, co-writer, or producer on pretty much every entry since the London 1969 expansion from way back in the day.
To many fans, it will be a little strange not seeing his name in the credits for GTA 6, when that actually comes out. However, there's no doubt that what he has planned for Absurd Ventures will turn heads, especially with the words "is it OK to dream again?" seen in the promo video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game coming to Nintendo Switch Online is Fire Emblem. 
More specifically, Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance version of Fire Emblem, otherwise known as Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, is coming to its subscription service for all Expansion Pack subscribers next week on June 23. This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. 


A prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. 
Fire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week. While waiting for Fire Emblem to hit the library on June 23, read Game Informer's review of Fire Emblem Engage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory can be a fickle thing. For thirty-something Mimi, everything before her thirteenth birthday is a blank. What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.

Toaplan, a shooting game developer that flew high in the '80s with titles like Twin Cobra and Truxton, possesses a formidable resume. Batsugun, the company's swan-song shooter, and one of its most historically significant works, spearheaded an evolution of the genre that remains prevalent today.
Programmer Tsuneki Ikeda joined Toaplan late in its life cycle. His first project, 1992’s Grind Stormer, acts as a bridge between traditional shooting game motifs and an emergent ‘manic’ gameplay structure. A year later, Batsugun cemented the concept and established the ‘bullet hell’ style — a formula that would underpin everything Ikeda and several other ex-Toaplan staff would go on to achieve at Cave Co. Ltd.

Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro — whose most famous films include Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, Hellboy, and this year's Best Animated Feature winner Pinocchio — has praised The Super Mario Bros. Movie for "moving things" in the animated movie world.
Del Toro was speaking a the Annecy animation festival on Tuesday, with The Hollywood Reporter (via GoNintendo) in attendance. The director spoke about his love of animation and revealed to the audience that after a few more live-action films he wants to focus "only on animation", following the success of his stop-motion adaptation of Pinocchio for Netflix.

It was back in August 2022 when we first heard that the brilliant Moving Out would be getting a sequel — creatively titled, Moving Out 2 — and we then got another sneak peek at the game just last week when a teaser appeared at this year's Future Games Show Summer Showcase. Now, Team17 have provided a little more information about the title, including the fact that it will be heading for Switch on 15th August.
The news was accompanied by a brand-new trailer which is all about gameplay — a nice change from the recent cinematic teaser. From what we can see, expect much of the same chaotic couch co-op, as you and your friends attempt to navigate a series of whacky environments, moving everything and the kitchen sink from point A to B.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pivot!
Get packed, Team17, SMG Studio, and Devm Games have announced that Moving Out 2, the sequel to their backbreaking furniture moving simulator, is coming out on August 15.
Picking up after the end of the volcanic climax of Moving Out, Moving Out 2 sends the Furniture Arrangement Relocation Technicians (FARTs) to cosmic new places. While this does still mean you’ll be lugging couches around, there also appears to be more abstract stages where you’re loading up delicious confections.
https://youtu.be/BfaDFovJ_2M
Moving Out 2 looks to be more of the same, honestly. There are new levels and more movers to jump into the pants of. However, it’s not like Moving Out was nothing more than moving refrigerators and color TVs. There were more challenging conditions in between, and that seems to be the case again in the sequel.
That’s fine with me. Moving Out is one of my favorite couch co-op games to play with my parents and husband. It’s slightly less stressful than Overcooked, which means there’s less chance that my mother will stab my father. I’m looking forward to another chance to push them closer to the edge.
Moving Out 2 will be dropping on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on August 15, 2023.

There's a certain feeling a good 2D Sonic game can elicit. The sense of zipping through levels at a pace that seems way too fast, as even the scrolling screen struggles to keep up with how fast the blue blur is moving, is a core memory for those who grew up around a Sega Genesis. And it's a feeling I got when I was playing the newest Sonic entry, Sonic Superstars.
Sonic Superstars is, to put it frankly, a classic Sonic game. It's 3D in models but 2D in design, though there are plenty of twists to change that up. The base foundation is familiar: you run, left to right, across the screen to hit the goal. Every so often, Dr. Robotnik / Eggman will roll in with an increasingly complicated machine you'll need to bonk your head against a few times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Head exec says he doesn't know where the Zelda movie rumors came from.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a smash hit, leading it to become the second highest-grossing animated movie ever. After such success, making a The Legend of Zelda movie would seem like a logical next step.
A recent report claimed that Illumination, the studio behind the Mario movie, is already working with Nintendo to make an adaptation of the Zelda series. The rumor spread like Internet wildfire, but there's one problem with this story. TheWrap talked with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri to ask about a Zelda movie, and it looks like Link's story isn't on the table for the studio. Meledandri even adds that he has no idea where these rumors are coming from. Outside of blind guesses from fans, that is.
"I mean I can understand how people would surmise all sorts of things because obviously, we’ve had a great experience working together," said Meledandri. "My relationship with Nintendo now includes being on their board of directors, so I understand how people can surmise these things. But in terms of the specifics, that was just something that I’ve been hearing lots of reports. This is just about what’s next between Nintendo and Illumination.”

Rumors every week
Benjamin Renner, a director at Illumination currently working on Migration, also chimed in about the issue. He says that he sees "one report every week" of what their team is working on next, and this one just so happened to be Zelda.
Illumination, the studio behind other hits such as Sing and Despicable Me, has already fast-tracked a Mario sequel. That could prove to be a reason why a Zelda movie might not see the light of day just yet.
Still, the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie has earned Meledandri a seat on Nintendo's board of directors. We'll have to wait and see if Illumination will take on other Nintendo properties in the future.

Since its release, it's been hard to talk about Cyberpunk 2077 without discussing its launch. It's one of the more notable examples of a rough start in recent memory. With every update since, fixing bugs and adding features as well as versions for newer generation consoles, the question of whether Cyberpunk 2077 is going to realize its original vision gets brought up. And after playing some of its expansion Phantom Liberty, I think it's finally there.
Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077's first, and only, expansion. CD Projekt Red has a good reputation for its expansions, after two phenomenal additions to The Witcher 3. From just a small slice, Phantom Liberty already feels like it's living up to that legacy. The story and setting are excellent, and it delves into some ri…]]></summary>

Naughty Dog announced today via Twitter that an exclusive The Last of Us experience will be a part of the Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios. Not much information is available so far, but it is listed as a haunted house on the Halloween Horror Nights 2023 event listing. We also got a brief announcement video featuring some clickers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79JVUnQToU4
The event page claims that "you and your squad will join Joel and Ellie and encounter the haunting and overgrown world in a brand-new terrifying way as you make your way through an abandoned Pittsburgh." The announcement tweet also says we should "prepare to encounter Clickers, Hunters, and more."
From gaming to television to amusement parks
This attraction continues the multimedia spread of The Last of Us following its highly successful TV adaptation. The hit show has a second season on the way.
Meanwhile, fans eagerly await the upcoming The Last of Us multiplayer game. The project was delayed with no new time frame last month.
Even though we don't have many details, this could be a cool experience. The cordyceps fungus has an odd way of being artistically beautiful and terrifying at the same time. An immersive haunted house experience—if done right—could be the perfect medium for The Last of Us.
According to the event website, tickets for Halloween Horror Night range from $79.99-$299.99. Fans will be able to experience this haunted house at both Universal Studios locations in Hollywood and Orlando.

2011’s Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective feels like it’s always been a bit of an oddball. The DS title was Ace Attorney director Shu Takumi’s shot to create something new, a “different kind of mystery” from the courtroom battles of Phoenix Wright and friends.
Though received well, sales seem mixed; it was a best-selling Nintendo DS game in Japan the week of its release, but Capcom would later note it struggled. All of this helped build, at least in my perception, a cult-classic vibe around it. It wasn’t the most popular DS game, but those in the know who dug the DS highly valued it.
So that's where we find Ghost Trick now, as it's getting a revival on modern consoles. A demo is currently available, containing the first two chapters. And alongside a chance to play that section a…]]></summary>

If you've been waiting to play the remake of The Last of Us Part I on Steam Deck, you're in luck. The latest update for the game now makes Naughty Dog's masterpiece compatible with the Valve handheld.
Update 1.1.0 for the game also comes with a ton of tweaks and changes. Looking at the patch notes on Steam shows a healthy list of fixes. Chief among these are important optimizations for CPU and GPU performances, improvements to texture loading, as well as a number of glitch repairs and bug fixes.
When The Last of Us Part 1 was released on PC back in March, the game was plagued with more than its fair share of issues. This led to a series of negative reviews on Steam, as players were understandably upset about the state of the anticipated remake. Several updates have been released since launch, fixing around 40 bugs and glitches, so it's in much better shape these days, at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxVyuE2Nn_w
Easily considered one of the best releases of the PS3 era, the original The Last of Us was a tour de force in video game development and storytelling. A slick remaster was released for PS4 in 2014, while the smash-selling sequel launched in 2020. The Last of Us Part II did split the crowd somewhat, but it was still an impactful game from Naughty Dog.
Despite the series' reputation, some were skeptical that the studio was remaking something that was barely a decade old and already looked stunning even on previous-gen hardware. That said, the remake enjoyed a positive reception, and the HBO adaptation was highly praised indeed. In short, The Last of Us, as a brand, is doing very well for itself, and now you can even play Part I on the go!
The Last of Us Part I is available now on PS5 and PC.

After spending half an hour with Oxenfree II: Lost Signals at Summer Game Fest, there's an immediate sense that the sequel is shaping up to be a much bigger, bolder, and indeed stranger experience than its predecessor.
As it probably should be. In speaking with developer Night School's founder and director, Sean Krankel, he confirmed that while the original Oxenfree was completed in 16 months, the sequel has taken the studio a full three years to craft. You can definitely see the fruits of the studio's labour, too, with this entry so far proving to be a much more accomplished piece of work in every facet: character models are much more detailed with enhanced animation; environments are brought to life with beautiful colour and lighting; the gameplay feels much smoother and more fluid than before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I forgot this was a thing!
Remember when studio Feral Interactive announced in 2021 that the Lara Croft Collection was coming to Switch in 2022? Me neither! Confirmed as a "collaboration" between Feral Games and Crystal Dynamics, the collection (which consists of two spinoff games featuring Tomb Raider hero Lara Croft) was delayed, seemingly indefinitely. But now it's back.
The latest news comes straight from a new trailer released by Feral Interactive, which definitively announces a June 29, 2023 release date. While the Switch version won't have any major extra features, it does still have four-player local co-op, among all of the other benefits of playing on Switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlq-VxMgza0
What even is the Lara Croft Collection that's coming to Switch?
As a reminder, this collection deals with the two isometric action romps:
Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light (2010)
Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris (2014)
We have reviews for both! And yes, one of them is over a decade old at this point. If you have local folks available, $24.99 isn't a bad price point for what will essentially amount to a weekend of isometric action fun. Each game will last you roughly five hours.
Comparison shopping for the Lara Croft Collection
You can find the collection on the Nintendo eShop now for $24.99.
You can pick up both of those games, as well as "every other Tomb Raider title ever released on PC" on Steam for $28.43 until June 26.
On Xbox, the Temple of Osiris + the season pass is on sale for under $5, and on the PSN the Temple of Osiris is available for $19.99.
Given the delistings of either game on some platforms (including iOS), the Switch port is making strides in the preservation department.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This game is going to have such a long tail
We're still writing about Zelda: Breath of the Wild news on occasion despite the fact that it's over six years old at this point, and Tears of the Kingdom's reach just might outlast it. Amid all of the frankly insane devices and creations we've seen the community come up with, this new wave of videos showcases another creative element: music.
How the community is creating music in Tears of the Kingdom
What the community is essentially doing is using stakes and lasers [beam emitters] (or other things) to create musical notes, which are then strung together through specific stake placements and item manipulation. Given how easy it is to head to a Zonai device dispenser, amass stakes, and save/quit in a field while experimenting, anyone who is willing can give it a shot.
Check out this short tutorial from Twitter user bran8bit.
https://twitter.com/bran8bit/status/1667539615413334017
Since then, the community at large took this knowledge and ran with it. Take this invention from Twitter user kabukichi00: they use an existing in-game platform to perfectly recreate the ever-present "Song of Storms" track.
https://twitter.com/kabukichi00/status/1668898001165877255
Another clip from kody_botw shows off how players can manually create music by lifting a laser cannon up with Ultrahand, and even play along with the background track.
https://twitter.com/kody_botw/status/1668587177973026817
Then there's this clip from noteabletony, who goes a step further and gets a minecart involved.
https://twitter.com/noteabletony/status/1668350921158320159
Welp, I still have more Street Fighter 6 and Diablo 4 to play, but this is my evening sorted! I suspect in just a week's time we're going to see a clip of an entire symphony recording out of this game somehow.

At the Annecy International Animation Festival, Meledandri told TheWrap "I don't know where that came from" regarding the rumour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the year’s best (and most literal) surprises, Hi-Fi Rush, is getting a free update that keeps the beat going with the addition of new modes and content. 
The “Arcade Challenge! Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. 


The first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. 
This update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. 
Hi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can read our review of the game here.]]></summary>

Following on from yesterday's confirmation that Persona 3 Reload is also headed to PlayStation and Steam platforms alongside its Xbox and Windows brethren, publisher Atlus has now let fans know that the intriguing — and pretty rad looking — Metaphor: ReFantazio is coming to the same platforms.
The port announcement was spotted by the eagle eyes of Gematsu over on the Korean Twitter of publisher Sega, though it seems both the tweet and the accompanying trailer including the port reveal have seemingly vanished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btHGCpUPjPk
Announced during the weekend's Xbox Games Showcase and developed by Studio Zero, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand-new fantasy franchise based around the concept of mirroring realities. While not all that much is known regarding the narrative and gameplay mechanics, the title coming from the producers of Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5 suggests that we'll get a wild, highly stylized adventure starring a cast of easily shippable and cosplay friend characters, and mucho dungeon crawling.
It's definitely one of the most surprising and exciting reveals of Summer Game Fest, and while its development probably means Persona 6 is on the back burner for the time being, Metaphor: ReFantazio is already turning heads with its dynamic, action-packed, and legitimately breathless trailer. I'm looking forward to Atlus lifting the curtain on this cool-looking universe.
Metaphor: ReFantazio is scheduled to launch in 2024 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

You might remember at the start of the week we realised that it was possible to make music in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by hitting a Zonai Stake with a beam, the pitch varying based on how deeply the stake is buried in the ground. In our original coverage, we predicted that "it will only be a matter of time before we see the concept pushed further" and sure enough, it has taken a mere three days for some players' creativity to amaze us all over again.
The first demonstration of the in-game build-your-own xylophone managed to get a little jingle up and running, but some players have since managed to use it to recreate some iconic Zelda tunes.

We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. "It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.
And yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest, Not-E3, Keigh3... whatever you want to call this festival of hype, its annual takeover of the game industry’s collective headspace meant there was only ever going to be one topic for the Electronic Wireless Show podcast this week. Alice even made up for her recording absence by pre-emptively tying Nate to a chair and forcibly making him watch trailers, like that bit in A Clockwork Orange but with "WORLD EXCLUSIVE" flashing up every thirty seconds. Still, we keep it light by focusing on the games we actually like the look of, from The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria to Starfield, Nova Roma to Dungeons of Hinterberg.

It normally retails close to its $159.99 MSRP, but today you can pick one up for $103.99 at Best Buy when you bring in any old peripheral for recycling - a pretty great deal for a brand new mouse of this calibre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, self-proclaimed "unconventional ARPG" Everhood 2 was revealed as part of IGN's Summer of Gaming, and yep, it's looking like a suitably weird follow-up to its 2021 predecessor. According to a press release, the sequel is due out in early 2025, so about a year and a half away as it stands, and you'll of course be able to pick it up on Steam when it does. Come and watch its reveal trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard not to!
We Love Katamari might be the perfect video game sequel. Dialing just about every beloved mechanic and detail from the first game up to 11, all while ditching some of Katamari Damacy’s less beloved aspects, it’s no surprise that this entry is the fan favorite. For better and worse, its re-release, We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie, asks you the question, “If it ain’t broke, why fix it?” With a handful of remixed levels, crisp HD graphics, and a smattering of quality-of-life features, Reroll + does its best to avoid stepping on the original’s toes while bringing the nearly 20-year-old game into the present day in clean, vibrant HD.
That new facelift might actually be We Love Katamari Reroll’s most significant addition. That’s not to say that the game didn’t look great back on PS2. In fact, its visuals have aged remarkably well compared to many of its contemporaries. It’s just that compared to modern consoles the PS2’s color palette and graphical capabilities lend a dim, washed-out look to even the brightest, most vibrantly multicolored games. Anyone who played the original back in the day might be shocked to hear that, but even a cursory search or glance at a Let’s Play might surprise you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are old games that are plain too hard to get into now, even I have to concede. Ancient ruins of a house to be admired and contemplated, but not fit to live in. The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. 
It's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.
What I'm saying is: it's still worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dambuster Studios have offered up a rough roadmap of what we can expect from the pair of upcoming Dead Island 2 story expansions. The first of the two expansions, titled Haus, asks the question, "How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?" and answers that with "a techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore!". Sounds about right. This first expansion has quite a vague release window, expected to launch some time between October and December this year.

It's another slowish week, as the main games Nintendo is highlighting this week are of the live service variety.
Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3 dropped recently with its Optimus Prime-flavored season pass, and there are more updates for Disney Dreamlight Valley (The Remembering), Rocket League (Season 11), Overwatch (Season 5), and Disney Speedstorm (Season 2). Wait, Disney Speedstorm just dropped Season 2?
It really is the "early summer of live service" so far, post-Zelda. One of the next big releases is Final Fantasy XVI on June 22 on PS5, which will end the streak. In terms of Switch games from AAA publishers, Crash Team Rumble is next on the slate on June 20.

I'm exceedingly pumped for Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown - and so is Prince Of Persia creator, Jordan Mechner. When I visited Ubisoft Montpellier at the end of May, one of things game director Mounir Radi told me about during my visit was how relieved he felt after showing Mechner a very early prototype. And in speaking to Mechner earlier this week about how he feels about The Lost Crown now, he tells me that "what I've seen so far of their modern 2D Metroidvania take on [Prince Of Persia] has got me excited and very eager to play."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take note...literally
Valve's biggest money spinner, Steam, is consistently being tweaked, and this latest update brings some visual changes to the client, as well as some new features. Whether you use the PC gaming storefront on desktop, mobile, or Steam Deck, you'll have noticed a few differences lately.
A short video highlights the new features that have been implemented. In a nutshell, the general layout has been given a "fresh coat of paint." Not so much that it doesn't look like Steam anymore. But is a bit different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8jv24NjOWQ
Valve has also made notifications "richer and more useful." Make of that what you will. You'll also notice the in-game overlay has been tweaked and now boasts more options for "better customization". One of the newest things to be added is a Notes feature which, as the name suggests, allows you to take notes during play. You can even pin it so it stays on top of your game in case you need to refer to it. There have also been some improvements to controller experiences as well, which adds a gamepad overlay and additional "virtual menus".
If you use Steam on Mac or Linux machines, the new update also enables hardware acceleration for these versions of the client, which should lead to a more responsive experience. That's according to the video, at least.
This latest update has been rolled out to all versions of Steam, including the official app. If you want to take a deep dive into the laundry list of changes that have been made recently, you can check out the full patch notes on the Steam website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much as I adored Theme Park, it's a bit of a weird game to have inspired so many descendants. The latest is Park Beyond, and for the most part it's exactly what you'd expect. Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.
That's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.

Essentially, the big thing it lets you do is build your own unique voxel structures by, essentially, painting them in the air. Think of it as a sort of paired back, voxel-focused approach to a piece of 3D modelling software like Blender.

Life in the world of Mortal Kombat 1 sure moves fast — It was only a few weeks back that NetherRealm Studios revealed the latest release in the gory fighting franchise, and already we're entering the playable beta stages, with the game launching on PC and console platforms just three months from now.
And if the recent gameplay footage from Summer Game Fest whet your bloodthirsty appetite, you monster, then you could get the opportunity to play Mortal Kombat 1 for yourself next week, with the koming of a new "Online Stress Test", designed to put pressure on the new sequel-prequel's servers ahead of the launch period. The testing period will run from June 23-26 and will offer up one-on-one online action and limited Klassic Tower battles, obviously with something of an abridged roster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV175rgyH0k
If you want to throw your name in Kung Lao's razor hat, then head on over to the official website and register today. Interested parties will need a Warner Bros. gaming account, (you can register at the time if necessary), and the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test is only open to PS5 and Xbox Series X users in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Brazil. Lucky Kombatants will then receive access kodes to download the beta client at some point next week, ahead of the head-ripping khaos.
Mortal Kombat 1 launches September 14 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Our own Eric van Allen has already played a build of the exciting-looking scrapper, and you can read his thoughts right here.

The speedy hog is forever occupying a booth and starring in some new-fangled thing, which oscillates between a 2D sidescroller laser-targeted at old-school fans, or 3D ones like Frontiers that try their utmost to push the series forwards.
So, I've gone and played another Sonic haven't I? This time I spent around 15-minutes with Sonic Superstars at this year's Summer Game Fest, a new 2.5D sidescroller that seems to successfully combine the feel of Sonic Mania with a modern art style and some new tricks. If you like old Sonic games, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love it. If you don't, there's no doubt in my mind you'll think it's agony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space-Ships
A mysterious new logo is being shared online this morning, purportedly an as-yet-unannounced new project in the popular fantasy franchise, Star Ocean. As reported by RPGSite, a banner for a "Star Ocean The Second Story R" was first discovered on the support site of IP owner Square Enix.
Originally released for PlayStation in 1998, Star Ocean: The Second Story is, as the name suggests, the second entry in the action-RPG series, which won over fans with its sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, myriad paths and conclusions, and very heavy emphasis on dating mechanics between multiple characters, allowing players to essentially dictate both narrative and gameplay through the pairing (or not) of relationships.
The "R" in the new banner suggests that this popular release may be in line for the remake/remaster treatment, though obviously, Square Enix is yet to speak on the discovery. Back in 2019, the publisher released the similarly titled Star Ocean First Departure R on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, which was itself a remaster of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the first game in the series. Thus, a continuation along these lines is very likely, and very good news for Star Ocean fans.
Of course, we will be sure to keep you updated should Square Enix be forthcoming with any news.

Valve announced the desktop update back in April, where the new version has been in beta for some Steam users to try out. In Valve's post from yesterday announcing the update is available for all, it did note that the "most impactful changes in this update aren’t immediately visible," as a lot of the work put into the update was today with how it "[shares] code across the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck." According to Valve, these changes should mean that future features should be more quickly implemented and iterated upon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Damned if you Don't
As part of yesterday's Grasshopper Manufacture 2023 live stream, the studio announced that its recently-revealed Shadows of the Damned: Remastered is "probably" going to be released on "all current platforms."
A typically tongue-in-cheek promo re-introduces us to Mexican demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who is not only "More terrifying than any demon", but is also "the most determined, devoted man in the world". So form a queue, ladies. The preview then describes Shadows of the Damned as "A nonstop-action love story taking you straight through the deepest depths of Hell". Sweet.
"Coming to all current platforms," concludes the preview, before adding "Probably."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THS60cC3768&t=270s&ab_channel=GrasshopperArchives
Elsewhere in the Grasshopper Direct, community manager James Mountain seemingly returns from the dead, while fellow CM Maddie Copp turns up cosplaying as No More Heroes' notorious Bad Girl. It also looks really hot under those studio lights. Of course, "Suda51" himself puts in an appearance, dazzlingly dressed in a lucha mask and green suit, reminiscent of Saints Row villain Killbane. Suda seemed a lot bigger and much more American than you may recall, but that's just your brain playing tricks on you, as it was definitely him. Even though he had a different face.

The show closed with a fleeting glimpse of the studio's next game, with viewers treated to what appears to be the in-game menu for the mystery project. While little can be divulged from the sneak peek, I did notice an "Emerald Flowsion" gauge, at least confirming that Goichi's love for pro-wrestling will continue to make its mark on all of the studio's output.
Shadows of the Damned: Remastered is currently in development for all platforms. Probably.

Remnant: From The Ashes entered the looter-shooter space in 2019, defining its core loop with procedurally-segmented levels and Dark Souls-inspired mechanics like a stamina-based dodge roll and limited-use health consumables. Remnant’s fresh take on the shooter genre attracted praise, including Game Informer’s review which states, “Strong systems and a satisfying gameplay loop give Remnant: From The Ashes a powerful foundation, even if the experience is mired by repetitive and uninteresting bosses and environments.“

Now this is a premium option, with a normal price point of £999, but today with the 48HR20 code it's a slightly more palatable £799 at the Samsung UK store.

They have two PS1 titles on offer: Worms and Herc’s Adventures. This is alongside the PSP’s Killzone: Liberation. I mean, those games are something. They’re not nothing. You might consider Herc’s Adventures a hidden gem if you’re being generous.
Here’s a list of the games they’re headlining because they think no one cares about older titles:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rogue Legacy 2 is one heck of a roguelike that only Xbox, Switch, and PC fans have enjoyed since it launched in 1.0 last year. Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.
Developer Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. 


We awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, "Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells joins the growing list of video games getting animated series adaptations with a show based on the popular action roguelike slated to arrive next year.
This series comes from French animation studio Bobbypills, which is also animating Netflix’s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired Captain Laserhawk. Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. 


Dead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. 
For more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.]]></summary>

For him and his team, it's first and foremost "a whole new chapter" in the series, although you could call it a prequel, if you really wanted to. Whatever you do, though, don't call it a reboot. Oops.

Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?
Having seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.

So I put the question to art director Jean-Christophe Alessandri and game director Mounir Radi after my demo session.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It sounds like Xbox really wants Starfield to be as bug free as possible, as apparently every QA staff member is working on the game. This comes from Giant Bomb, who spoke with Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty and Xbox boss Phil Spencer. The two spoke about a range of topics to do with Xbox as a whole, but Booty notably claimed that Starfield would be the Bethesda game with the least amount of bugs the developer has ever shipped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a proper look at Starfield (which my brain autocorrects to "Garfield" every single time I read it) on Sunday thanks to a dedicated 45 minute long presentation that showcased the game's various systems, planets and characters in granular detail. 45 minutes is a long time to devote to one video game, you could argue. Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? 
Anyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it? Who needs Todd Howard when you can listen to me, a tired man wearing an unironed t-shirt, telling you about the game instead.

The developer announced the news that the much-delayed game would be receiving a beta alongside a… sea shanty, which is obviously fitting given the whole it being a pirate game thing, but is maybe the funniest way of doing such an announcement for a game that seems like it's never coming out. You can currently sign up to potentially join the closed beta on the game's website, with the test set to take place August 25-28.

Embracer own 138 studios and have over 16,500 people working for them, and it's not clear how many will remain afterwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.
The collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.


The Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.
Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

A brief update during the Capcom Showcase confirmed the game's release was slipping out of 2023 and into the unknown.


The video shows the enigmatic, glowy-eyed little girl (apparently named Diana) innocently drawing as her decidedly adult astronaut(?) guardian fends off mechanized attackers before he whisks her away from danger. We then see her doodle is a cute vehicle to break the bad news, followed by a more formal message from the development team stating...
It is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release of Pragmata.
Our team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.
Thank you for your continued support.
-The Pragmata Development Team
Pragmata was first announced in 2020, and we still know next to nothing about it. So far, we've seen that some kind of catastrophe has befallen Earth, and the game unfolds in a "near-future dystopian world on the moon," according to Capcom. The game was originally slated for 2022 before getting delayed to 2023. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

We got some hands-on in with the game while visiting Los Angeles for the Summer Game Fesst festivities, and we are only more eager for the game's full release after spending 20 minutes with the game.

There were swift apologies from its developers and pledges to improve the experience, a process which started today with the release of Redfall's 1.1 patch. It offers "incremental improvements" to combat, AI and visuals across the open world vampire shooter, alongside a commitment that there will be more updates to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that last-gen graphics cards are getting huge discounts at the moment, as pent-up demand has been sated and next-generation models are starting to be released from both Nvidia and AMD's lineups. We've covered more mid-range models before, but today we have something a bit different: a truly mainstream graphics card that delivers excellent 1080p performance at less than £200, plus nice extras like ray-tracing hardware, FSR 2 image upscaling and a modern media encoder for streaming and recording gameplay. 
I'm talking about the AMD Radeon RX 6600, which is available in the popular Sapphire Pulse configuration for £180 plus £8 shipping over at Overclockers UK - with a free copy of the Resident Evil 4 remake. This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago. Nice!

It's an open world racer set in O'ahu, Hawaii with street, track and off-road races structured around a festival. Given how good Forza Horizon games are, I am fine with all of these similarities. At tonight's Ubisoft Forward, the third game in The Crew series got a couple of trailers and a relese date: September 14th.

Since the reveal of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2021, I’ve been curious how The Division developer Ubisoft Massive will take on this property, one of the most financially successful movie franchises in the world, and translate it into a video game. Knowing Ubisoft’s pedigree, I imagined what Frontiers of Pandora might look like: something between Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry. After a special behind-closed-doors presentation during Ubisoft’s summer gaming event, I can say I was spot on. 
Most interesting to me, instead of controlling an Avatar, which is meant to resemble Pandora’s native Na’vi,…]]></summary>

I am a man who understands only that there are lanky Smurfs who live in a world you'd get if you mashed Halo and Viva Piñata together. So, having seen roughly 30 minutes of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, I can give you the unfettered lowdown of a person who's analysed it with a cold, hard stare. In brief, the game looks rather lovely! If… too lovely. I worry there's a big catch somewhere and I can't put my finger on it.

There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a "true" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake.

The demonstration starts with Kay trying to make her way out of a deadly situation. While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Ubisoft's Foward event, we got a new look at gameplay from Assassin's Creed Mirage – a throwback of sorts to the long-running series' roots. 
In the footage, we see a few assassinations, a chase, and our protagonist Basim taking on missions. There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.
Check out the gameplay footage below.


Notably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.
You can also check out a new trailer for the game below.


Assassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.]]></summary>

We next saw footage of gameplay from Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade, the free-to-play mobile title set in ancient China that was announced last September. The brief montage showed off shots of the detailed open world and the signature assassin’s gameplay.

Players will explore the city of Honolulu, drive up volcanic rocks, and along beachsides. It seems clear that The Crew Motorfest has drawn at least some inspiration from the destination-focused gameplay of other racing games like Forza Horizon.
The game is also embracing the focus on car collection, including an option to import your car collection from the prior Crew game.
The Crew Motorfest is targeting a beta in July, so players should be able to get a better sense of the racing action in just a few weeks. The game is out on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-12T17:44:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a series of closed beta periods, XDefiant is ready for public testing. Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
XDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.

        <updated>2023-06-12T17:00:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora kicked off Ubisoft Forward with a new trailer providing our best look at the game yet.
Frontiers of Pandora follows the narrative blueprint of the films in that you control a Na’vi to protect your world from militaristic human invaders. The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.


The game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. 
We also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes all you need from a video game is a bit of bloodshed with your pals. And sometimes, all you need from a sequel is the first one, but a bit bigger and bit better. Having spent a few hours with third-person co-op shooter Remnant 2, I reckon it's shaping up to be exactly those two things. It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care. From what I've played, it's more about being the looter shooter for those who care about fine-tuning the consistency of the numbers they're able to extract from their foes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you missed it, yesterday’s Final Fantasy XVI Pre-Launch Celebration event delivered the announcement of a playable demo for the upcoming action RPG that you can play right now.
Dubbed the Playable Prologue, the demo consists of two big slices of the game. The first section is the 2+ hour-long opening prologue, in which your save data will carry over to the full game when it launches later this month.
The second segment is a  2-hour long action-focused mission centering on Clive’s infiltration of a fort. While the progress from this section will not transfer to the final game, it does provide a hefty sample of the game’s stylish-action-inspired combat. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. The game graces Game Informer’s cover this month, and you can read a month’s worth of exclusive features about the game by visiting our coverage hub.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me tell you, being at an Xbox Games Showcase in-person is quite the experience. I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.
The countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, "five, four, three!", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of "Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.

During Summer Game Fest 2023, I had a chance to get a behind-closed-doors look at Alan Wake, the highly anticipated sequel 13 years in the making.
The road to Alan Wake 2 was full of speed bumps involving publishing rights and finding the right ideas, hence the 13-year gap. "We've been trying and now finally everything just clicked into place," co-director Sam Lake says. "We got the publishing rights of the original game back, so we were in a position to create a remastered version for the PlayStation audience as well as a wider audience. And we were trying to d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of the launch of its Steam Next Fest demo next week, I've been playing a substantial early build of Mimimi Games' latest stealth strategy game, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. 
As you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th.

It's coming from some veteran EVE devs, who place an emphasis on community, inclusivity and player agency. I suspect I will never play it, but will very much enjoy reading about those who do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors just can't seem to die, but it's unclear whether that's due to its attentive development team or the immortal nature of vampires. Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.


The update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.
Vampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. For more on the game, check out why we gave it such a high review, or learn about its upcoming TV adaptation.]]></summary>

Today's PC Gaming Show gave us an exciting update, and much sooner than we might have expected: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is currently in development.


The sequel takes place in the same world as the last, "some time" after the events Citizen Sleeper. As an escaped android with a malfunctioning body, you'll have to gather a crew, command a ship, and do what it takes to stay alive. If you want to keep an eye out for future updates, the game already has a Steam page.
If this game is anything like its predecessor, we're all in for a treat. We were big fans of the original Citizen Sleeper, with its inspired story and narrative mechanics leading to our reviewer calling it "a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." It also scored a spot on our Top Ten Games of 2022.]]></summary>

We’ve known it is a sci-fi game about traveling between planets from the creators of Skyrim for some time, but during Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase, Bethesda pulled back the curtain in a big way.
Alongside showing plenty of gameplay covering everything from walking around densely populated cities to exploring unpopulated planets to combat inside and outside of spaceships, Bethesda detailed some of the game’s story and impressive customization options.


Like past Bethesda games, you will find plenty of stories off the main path, but during the 45-minute presentation, we learned about an organization called Cons…]]></summary>

Despite an extremely rocky launch, I enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077 a lot. I beat it around its release in 2020, and I’ve checked in a few times to see how the CD Projekt Red’s post-launch work has improved the game, but those check-ins were always a few hours. I’d drive around, shoot some enemies, and listen to Run The Jewels on the in-game radio. Satisfied with my V’s ending, I didn’t have a reason to return to the meat of the ca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clockwork Revolution made its debut at today’s Xbox Games Showcase via a trailer that set the stage for its steampunk-flavored RPG action.
The first-person adventure puts you in control of a woman hailing from the steam-powered Victorian-era city of Avalon who discovers a time machine, along with the revelation that the city – and its brutal oppression of the lower class – is the result of intricate time manipulation by the villainous Lady Ironwood. To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. 


The game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. 
Clockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.]]></summary>

This carbon black version of the slimmer Xbox boasts roughly double the storage of its original white counterpart. That also means it’s more expensive, retailing for a hundred bucks more at $349.
As a reminder, the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive. It's also weaker than the $500 Series X, but even this new version remains a decent budget option for those looking to enter the current generation of gaming.

Overwatch 2 was originally created to add this exact new content to the beloved hero shooter, but months went by without any updates on story or PvE game modes.

The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.
The new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
