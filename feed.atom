        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Turn10's new Forza Motorsport is already on the horizon with its October 10 release date, that's not stopping the Forza Horizon 5 developer Playground Games from pumping all-new content into its flagship open-world racer. Indeed, Forza Horizon 5 will receive a substantial new content creation update via EventLab 2.0, giving players even more features and functionality to use in custom events and races. While there's a bunch of other content also making its way into the game, like new aftermarket body kits, EventLab 2.0 is the biggest draw here.
Playground Games announced EventLab 2.0 mere days ahead of its release on September 14 as part of the Horizon Creatives update. While the fact that almost two dozen new Vorsteiner rims are being added to the mix sure is neat, EventLab 2.…]]></summary>

Abriss has you destroying brutalist architecture in a futuristic cityscape using rockets, wrecking arms and laser pinwheels of your own design. Whatever you construct, the result is a glorious physics spectacle. After a little over a year in Steam Early Access, it hit 1.0 earlier this week.

It has been an entire year since Splatoon 3 was released (don't worry, we're just as shocked as you are) so, naturally, our minds are beginning to drift towards what comes next.
The correct answer is that mysterious 'Side Order' DLC — which is meant to show what would've happened if Team Order had beaten Team Chaos. But what about after that? The third entry in the splat-and-swim series was a huge success on launch and with the Inklings now popping up in Smash Bros. and Mario Kart, we think it's fair to say that the series is here for the long run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only Up!, the brutally difficult platformer that took Twitch by storm earlier this year, has been voluntarily removed from Steam by its creator.
Only Up! was created by SCKR Games, a studio consisting of just one person known as Indiesolodev. In a final update on Steam, they state that the game has been a source of stress over the past several months, and they now want to put the game behind them.
Indiesolodev will take the time off to grow as a developer, and they shared plans for a new game in the works called Kith.
“‘Kith’ - it will be a new experience and a new concept with realism, a completely different genre and setting, and the emphasis is on cinematography. This time I hope the project will be created by a small team. This is a challenging project on which I want to significantly improve my skills in game design.”

This is not the first time Only Up! was removed from Steam. It was taken down briefly back in late June amidst controversy regarding stolen assets. Indiesolodev quickly removed the problematic assets, and the updated game was back on Steam in a matter of days.
There has also been pushback to NFT artwork being featured on some assets in what many players saw as an advertisement for NFTs.
Despite the controversy and janky controls, Only Up! was quite popular on Twitch for a time, attracting the attention of let’s players and speedrunners. With the sudden increase in scrutiny, it’s no wonder the developer felt stressed. 
I’m glad Indiesolodev is taking some time for themselves. Hopefully, with the support of a team behind them, the development of Kith goes much more smoothly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never watched the original Gargoyles animated series, but I've been on the internet for long enough to know that it's a cult favourite for being a Disney show with surprisingly dark themes. I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

Haver makes, among other things, comedic rotoscoped animations riffing on science fiction and video game tropes. 

It makes sense that Bethesda would have tapped him up to take the mick out of Starfield, then, given it combines both those tropes into a mockable whole.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder will continue the trend of simultaneous multiplayer platforming in the world of Super Mario and this time it's rolling with quite possibly the biggest roster ever, made up of not only Mario and co, but also a number of extras.
Nintendo recently asked fans on social media what character they would be picking first in this new Switch exclusive when it arrives next month, so we thought we would ask a similar question to our community here on Nintendo Life, and add a poll while we're at it to see who might even end up being the most popular character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's Sing 2024 is continuing the karaoke party with an all-new story mode and avatar customization, as announced on Thursday. Your avatar will show up on the screen singing alongside you. Publisher Plaion is packaging pop hits like Lizzo's "About Damn Time" and BTS' "Dynamite" into this year's editions. The game will feature "all-time" classics in the songlist, too.
Plaion and developer Voxler plan a "full-fledged" story (career) mode for this year's iteration that will "keep [us] rocking for hours and hours" that will take us from "amateur singing lessons to absolute stardom." The publisher says you'll "master songs and specific challenges while you meet unforgettable characters on your way to fame."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Fallout 3 launched, my roommates and I all retreated to our separate rooms to play the intro. When we emerged, we all had different stories. One snuck by the overseer. The other talked to them. As is often the case with me, I shot first and apologized afterward.
Bethesda’s open-world games seem to swing between spectacular introductions or less inspired ones. Morrowind had you fill out paperwork before kicking you out into the world so you could watch a hapless mage plummet from the sky. Daggerfall drops you into a very beginner-unfriendly dungeon. Fallout 4 leaves you to witness the end of the world. Then there's Starfield.
Starfield asks you to look at some rocks. Then it kicks you into one of the greyest vistas we’ve seen since the late aughts, just to prep you for more tutorials.

Not because of nostalgia for Final Fantasy 7, though I have fond memories of that game. Rather, it was because I have seen virtually this exact same game on mobile devices for the past seven years now.
Despite what Square Enix’s frankly confusing marketing might leave you to believe, Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is just a gacha game. Calling it “another possibility for a remake” maybe isn’t untrue, but it's a bit misleading. Games like Genshin Impact or even Square Enix’s own Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent have really raised the bar for mobile games, so I don’t blame anyone for thinking Ever Crisis would be more than it is. But rather than reaching for tho…]]></summary>

There aren’t enough games where you play as people with butts that are also horses. I’d have to think very hard to name a single one, which is why it’s unfortunate that it’s taken me so long to find Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder.
I’m familiar with the Golden Axe series, but I mostly know them from the games on Sega Genesis. My cousin and I used to play the original quite a bit, though we preferred Streets of Rage. I later discovered that the Japan-only Golden Axe III let you play as a ripped, shirtless panther-man. So, that’s pretty great.
Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder is a bit unique, however, in that it was arcade-exclusive. It has, to my knowledge, never b…]]></summary>

More specifically, they're asking who we want to see. The new FFXIV survey inquires about all the important personal details, like favorite mounts and minions, how you describe the game, and so on. Then there's a question at the end about which characters you'd like to see receive short stories. And y'all, I love those short stories.
On my end, Square's survey prompted a flurry of frantic Discord and Slack messages urging everyone within direct messaging distance to go answer. Some of those con…]]></summary>

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.
When I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke. More than a few parents back then truly believed that D&D was tantamount to actual demon worship, and they wouldn’t want t…]]></summary>

In Factorio: Space Age, every Item, Entity, and Equipment will now have five possible qualities. The qualities use familiar names: Normal, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Each successive quality after Normal increases the bonus you get from the higher tier quality. Uncommon will grant a 30% bonus, Rare a 60% bonus, Epic a 90% bonus, and Legendary a 150% bonus.
The intended goal of adding Quality to Factorio is to balance Horizontal versus Vertical growth in the core gameplay. In the current version, players have the challenge of building more mining outposts and production facilities—which is the Horizontal growth. But, also, have to consid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything comes full circle as Jean-Claude Van Damme prepares to join the lineup of Mortal Kombat 1. The inspiration for Johnny Cage is now a skin for the character, and he's on display in a new trailer. Van Damme provided his likeness and voice for the skin, which lets him fire off quips with the klassic kast. 
After trading blows that make Bloodsport seem tame, Van Damme closes out the clip with a brutal finisher. It's only appropriate that said finisher is delivered to Johnny Cage. Quite the gruesome price to pay for a life in the copycat spotlight. The video is age-restricted on YouTube, so you'll need to click through to watch. 
[caption id="attachment_403105" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot via NetherRealm Studios[/caption]
Splits Decision
The very existence of the Mortal Kombat series can be traced back to JCVD. Co-creator Ed Boon wanted a fighter with Van Damme at the center of it, but the action film star declined. Thus, the notoriously gory, original fighter that still has us all double-checking our spelling of combat was born.
The Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage will be available as part of the Kombat Pack. As previously detailed, you can get that pack in the Premium Edition and Kollector's Edition versions. Van Damme will be released alongside six new early access DLC characters, including Quan Chi, Ermac, Takeda Takahashi, Peacemaker, Omni-Man, and Homelander. There will also be five new Kameo Fighters, all of which will be available post-launch. The Van Damme skin will be usable at launch, so start practicing your splits now.
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 14, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been nearly a year since Splatoon 3 launched to much applause and fanfare. To celebrate, Nintendo is preparing to launch a truly contentious Splatfest — who among the members of Deep Cut would be the best leader? 
Starting at 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 8 and extending through 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 10, players must decide who would be the best leader: Shiver, Frye, or Big Man? It would seem as if the sides are evenly matched, at least based on the Twitter replies. “Who else is joining Team Big Man?” asked YouTuber Zack Scott, who received nearly 40 responses at the time of writing, all of which appealed for a different member of Deep Cut to take home the win. 
But, it would appear some folks fear the possibility of the majority ignoring the prompt in favor of making this Splatfest more of a popularity contest. “Remember guys, the question isn't about who your favorite Deep Cut member is, it's about who would make for a better leader out of them,” said one user on Twitter. They go on to admit their preference for Big Man, while also admitting their opinion that none of them would make good leaders. And then you’ve got the users who make it no secret that they’re not a fan of any available option. “Worst possible theme they could've done,” said one user. 
In any case, who are you rooting for in this anniversary Splatfest? Don’t forget to vote in-game at the Pledge Box!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Preorders have opened at Target for the Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector MEGA Building Set.
The Xbox 360 Mega Building Kit is 1342 pieces that assemble into a 3:4 scale model of the launch model of Microsoft’s 2005 console. I was there when the Xbox 360 launched. It was a pretty exciting time when it came about. Then, the hardware issues started happening. This was commonly known as the “Red Ring of Death,” named because of the error code that was displayed on the light ring around the power button.
The issue was caused by components heating up then cooling off quickly, which would cause connectors within them to break. It apparently wasn’t caused specifically by the console reaching a high heat, but rather the rapid cooling afterward. Uh, wait. What were we talking about? Blocks?
The Xbox 360 Mega Building Kit has you construct the console itself, a controller, and a disc case for Halo 3. It even comes with a detachable hard drive. Isn’t that cute?
It’s interesting that this isn’t being done by Lego. No disrespect to Mega Bloks, but it’s hard to beat the prestige of the Lego brand. Nintendo had their NES immortalized, and Atari brought around a 2600 set.
The Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector MEGA Building Set is available for pre-order (if it isn’t sold out) for $149.99 USD. It ships out starting October 8, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Superstars is one of many big titles scheduled to release in October. In the lead-up to the game, we've slowly been learning more about what Sonic Team is preparing. There's a new rival called Trip who's going to have an interesting backstory. Although Sonic Superstars is ditching the pixel art style of Sonic Mania, it'll retain the gameplay of classic Sonic titles.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1699814792448577813
With only weeks away from the game's release, Sega has revealed the music for the Pinball Carnival Zone. The track, which is composed by Rintaro Soma, is a smooth yet energetic tune featuring plenty of retro polyphonic beeps and a beat that's sure to get you pumped to go fast. This isn't the only music we've heard from Sonic Superstars, as we also got a snippet of the Bridge Island Zone's music in a gameplay stream from Sega.

The importance of music in Sonic
It's no mistake that a song reveal is being used to hype fans, as music has been an important part of the franchise's identity since its beginning. To celebrate Sonic's musical history, Sega has a Sonic Symphony World Tour kicking off this month that features an orchestra recreating some of the beloved soundtracks from throughout the decades.
https://twitter.com/TeeLopes/status/1678963998866194435
The soundtrack is in good hands, as the main composer is Jun Senoue. Franchise fans will be familiar with this name, as he has worked on the music of a few series titles including Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic Heroes. He'll be assisted by Sonic Mania composer Tee Lopes, who has excitedly assured fans that Superstars will feature an even better soundtrack.
Sonic Superstars is scheduled to release on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.

He announced this today on Twitter, stating that after working in the games industry for nearly 25 years, he is retiring to spend time with his wife and family. 
Most notably, Mustard served as the head of Fortnite, responsible for leading its storytelling and creative decision-making behind the game as a battle royale. Epic Games has not announced who will be taking over the role after Mustard retires, nor has it specified what the future of Fortnite looks like, although hundreds are working on it, and things will likely continue as usual. 
Here’s what Mustard posted on Twitter:
After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as Chief Creative Officer at Epic this month.

Xbox has struggled to get a massive hit for the Xbox Series X and S platforms. Halo Infinite ran into issues as players found the progression system lacking. Meanwhile, titles like Redfall failed to hit fan and critic expectations. Starfield garnering over six million players is likely some much-needed positive news for the Xbox team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.
Per Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. 
"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it," Baird tells EW. "It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story."
Stray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video games and parents often do not go hand in hand. They are often put on the back burner, if their existence is acknowledged at all. Sure, sad-dad games like The Last of Us or God of War (2018) received acclaim, but they're the exception.
Parents who aren't the protagonists of a contemplative journey with a younger person get an even more raw deal. Protagonists often have seemingly absent parents who are likely to leave them orphaned. This applies even to the recent Final Fantasy 16, where protagonist Clive's parents are quickly taken out of the picture.
This is where Starfield breaks some ground because Bethesda's latest popular RPG lets your parents be around. They can be out there somewhere, in a space as expansive as Starfield's, and they deserve a visit.

The last time this happened was the 2010 WoW expansion Cataclysm. According to Hazzikostas, the development team would learn lessons from Cataclysm which got a lot of negative criticism for deleting parts of the 2004-era WoW that many players loved. The goal would be to use modern solutions to preserve currently existing pieces of the game.
"We are definitely open to it at some point," Hazzikostas told GameSpot. "It is a shortcoming, if you take a step back and think about World of Warcraft as an ongoing living world, if we've kind of painted ourselves into a corner where we have all these iconic locations but we can't really use them because…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast 2TB NVMe SSDs are continuing their downwards slide towards affordability, with Crucial's popular (and fast) P5 Plus PCIe 4.0 SSD reaching a new low of $88 at Newegg today. That price is courtesy of a $10 discount when you use code SSACW527 and runs for today only. 
The P5 Plus is a drive that we've covered many times over on the RPS Deals beat, as it comes very close in performance to the top options in its category - your Samsung 990 Pros and your WD SN850xs - while often costing much less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has announced a digital broadcast set to air during Tokyo Game Show this month. The presentation takes place on September 21 at 2 a.m. PT/5 a.m. ET.
According to Xbox Wire, the event will feature “progress updates from Xbox and Bethesda Softworks and see a creatively diverse collection of games from creators predominantly located in Japan and across Asia.” The event will also reveal new titles for Xbox Game Pass.
The most likely game to appear is Final Fantasy XIV, which is heading to Xbox next spring ahead of its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which last popped up during this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, could also reappear. Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it's always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year. 
Tokyo Game Show runs from September 21 to 24. Publishers like Capcom, Atlus, Sega, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix, among others, will air dedicated livestreams throughout the event.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys with dreams of wrestling greatness.
If you’ve ever had the oddly specific dream of rising through the ranks of a toy-based wrestling world, then you’re in luck. WrestleQuest enters the ring with a deadly combo of late-'80s wrestling nostalgia and mid-'90s JRPG mechanics, celebrating both while not quite managing to deliver the three-count at the end. However, if you grew up in those very specific eras, you should find enough here to power through to the championship fight.
Mega Cat Studio’s latest offering builds a fascinating world right from the start. The populace of a children’s toy box has become obsessed with professional wrestling, idolising the likes of Macho Man Randy Savage and Jake the Snake. Life in the toy box revolves around wrestling and every conflict is settled in the ring with flashy moves and high-stakes action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first clocked the mysterious-looking OU when Japanese indie collective Asobu did their pre-Bitsummit showcase stream in 2021. It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.

However, since the current CEO Wade Rosen took the helm, they’ve been making a huge push at reconnecting with the past glory of the company. They’ve even gone as far as publishing new games for the Atari 2600, which is something that AtariAge has been doing for a long time now with their homebrew scene.
Currently, it sounds like everything is going to remain the same in terms of the forum and storefront. Atari isn’t going to suddenly own everybody’s homebrew projects. Some homebrew developers are curren…]]></summary>

I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it "diverting" rather than "entertaining", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.

Scrolling through social media channels, you’ll find that players have hammered away at their own unique designs while also creatively remaking other iconic vessels from Mass Effect, Star Wars, Halo and, of course, our friend Thomas The Tank Engine. There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once the hype around Starfield dies down a bit, discussion will once again turn to the next Elder Scrolls game. Nearly twelve years after Skyrim, the next installment is now finally said to be in the early stages of development. As such, Xbox head Phil Spencer has been asked whether the elusive RPG will be an Xbox exclusive.
In a recent interview with Bloomberg Technology, Spencer is asked a question about exclusivity. In particular, journalist Caroline Hyde is curious about what platforms The Elder Scrolls 6 may be on. Spencer answers by saying that the company looks at things "on a case-by-case basis."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-yYmq35E3I&t=83s
He adds that Xbox wants to make sure that the games made by the studio are "available in many different places." However, he specifically mentions the Xbox consoles, PC, and "via cloud," with no mention of any other platforms.
Too early to say, really
It kind of sounds like Spencer is circling the bit when it comes to The Elder Scrolls 6 and potential exclusivity. Consider that Starfield being an Xbox Series and PC game only seems to be working out nicely for the tech giant.
As such, it's not above the realm of possibility that Xbox may keep Skyrim's follow-up for its own platforms. However, we can't say for certain, but Spencer's response to the question does seem rather vague.
As for when it's actually coming out, speculations suggest it might be another five years until we see TES6. By that point, we'll be on the next generation of consoles anyway. Great. More money to spend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the sheer length of time Mario has been around, it's not surprising that people are able to beat the original Super Mario Bros. in record time. Speedrunning is a huge part of the gaming community, and the iconic Nintendo game is close to having the perfect run.
Over on YouTube, runner Niftski has set a new world record, beating Super Mario Bros. in just 4:54.631. Watching the challenge itself is quite spectacular, but if you're curious as to why they're so elated when they finish the game, it's due to how near-perfect the run was.
https://youtu.be/Khu9BB2g4Ks
You see, according to Niftski, someone just needs to shave off 0.366 seconds (or 22 frames) for it to be the absolute fastest – the literal limit – anyone can beat the classic platformer. Until now, this time was deemed impossible for human hands. But now a "new era" has begun for the speedrunning community.
Heart-pumping stuff
According to GamesRadar, this particular run is impressive because of something called "framerule." This is, as the report says, the "hidden in-game timer that checks every 21 frames to see if you've completed a level."
There's a 45-minute breakdown of how this works from YouTuber Summoning Salt, if you're interested in learning more. Suffice it to say, Niftski's record sets a new bar for others who want that perfect speedrun.
Speedrun.com has validated this latest run, which puts it just 0.233 seconds ahead of second place. Things are only going to get tighter, and it's going to be interesting to see who can come along and essentially do a frame-perfect run of Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let Mii entertain you.
The times are a-changin' for Nintendo, it seems. Nobody would doubt that the company has been video game-focused for the past few decades, but with theme parks, movies, and mobile apps popping up all over the place, it seems that the Big-N is moving in a slightly different direction.
This was echoed by Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser in a recent interview with the Washington Post, in which he stated that Nintendo is now "evolving into being an entertainment company with gaming as a nucleus of the overall business model." This will come as no surprise to many of us — you can't walk through town without seeing Mario DVDs, toys, and LEGO sets at the moment — and having put all of its hardware eggs in one basket by uniting its handheld and home console lines with Switch, diversification into arenas beyond the creation of video game systems and software makes sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confession time: if you've been keeping up to date with Colossal Order's feature highlight video series for Cities: Skylines 2 over the last couple of months, you're probably not going to learn a huge amount from my experience of playing it at Gamescom a couple of weeks ago. I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facepunch Studios' brutal online survival game Rust has been going (and going) for years. Its punishing gameplay seems to entice the most sadistic of players, and updates continue to add to the world. Now, the most recent patch implements enough new stuff to match a Schwarzenegger flick.
A recent video uploaded to the Rust/Facepunch YouTube channel gives a good idea of what you can expect the next time you log in. Among other things, the developer has now added an attack helicopter, which comes complete with a gunner seat. There's also a homing missile launcher to take down said helicopter, and also an armored hot air balloon because why not?
https://youtu.be/gTKll4bk968
One other thing that's been included in this latest update is the weapon rack. As the name suggests, this gives you a handy place to store all those guns. And while you're at it, have some parachutes as well, which allow you to "travel silently over long distances." More details about the new patch can be found on Steam.
Not rusty yet
If you're a newcomer to Rust, you'll know how tough it is to make it through those first few days. When it's not the threat of starvation or the wildlife that's keen on gnawing your bones, it's the other players who are, quite frankly, trigger-happy.
Still, it's worth it if you can thrive in this harsh environment. The game's been out for several years now – originally releasing to early access in 2013 – and Facepunch Studios seems only too keen to keep improving its survival IP. Plus, now you can literally "Get to the choppa!"

Since the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 in 2021, we’ve known Venom is a major villain in the game. And while that reveal teased what many thought to be Kraven the Hunter, it wasn’t confirmed to be him until later. Since then, we’ve learned that the game shares a tone with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and that Peter Parker will get a Venom Symbiote suit.

Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.
So, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.

The FFXIV Patch 6.5 art accompanies its special site launch, detailing features headed to the game in early October 2023. Most of the patch features we already learned about during the Live Letter in July, but the key art is new and gives us a little of the tone heading into Growing Light.
It's not like there's a ton of official Zero art out there since she made her debut not long ago, so I'll take it. There's also the precious angel Varshahn, the love-of-my-life Estinien, and Alisaie looking the happiest she's ever been around these people.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

It’s the experience finally rekindling my love for games as lengthier affairs without feeling like a drag. I can't get enough of the cast, the environments are enchanting, and the dialogue is spot-on. I've played it a little every day since launch with no signs of slowing down.
And looking at the rest of 2023, I don’t see anything dethroning the RPG, not even a messy glitch here or there, but oh god, did I ever break BG3 last night. Something’s definitely gone horribly wrong with my install, or right, as a glass-half-full kind of gal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been two years since bullet hell roguelike Ira launched in Early Access. Now it's almost ready to blast off outta there with Nicalis setting a PC launch date for October 3, 2023. Ira will be available for $19.99 on Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. 
Ira puts players in the role of a girl named Yeon, who channels an ancient god's powers to battle the forces of Chaos. Korean studio ABShot is behind this one, which mixes anime-style art with bullet hell shooting and roguelike game design. You can see a sample in the PC release date trailer below.

Bringing a bow to a laser fight
If you're a fan of the bullet hell brand of shooters popularized by developers like Toaplan and Cave, you'll be right at home in this colorful maze of lasers. In addition to godly powers, Yeon wields a bow in her quest to locate the scattered remnants of the Ira crystal. Over 150 different bows can be found throughout the game along with various active and passive power-ups. Some might say 150+ bows is overkill, but can you ever really have enough? There are 150 unique relics and 43 bow+relic combo synergies on top of that, and Yeon can summon five Apostles to perform ultimate skills and trigger passive perks. 
As for the roguelike elements, Ira's six stages consist of procedurally generated maps and weapon drops come at random. Early Access feedback seems mostly positive on Steam, where folks have been providing feedback since August 31, 2021. We'll find out how the final version shapes up soon.

However, in a tucked-away corner of the show floor sat an unassuming display featuring a well-loved NES system and a small board signifying its role: demoing a brand new title called Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon made an unexpected appearance on the popular interview show Hot Ones to talk about Mortal Kombat 1 and the series as a whole. As Boon sweats through increasingly spicy wings, we also get a glimpse at the previously announced Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage. 
For the unfamiliar, Hot Ones is a 1-on-1 interview show in which celebrity guests are asked questions while devouring wings that get gradually spicier as the interview progresses (usually to humorous results). Boon’s discussion delves into his entry into the game industry, Netherrealm's decision-making process when selecting cross-over fighters, the studio's approach to storytelling, and other topics. Boon is one of, if not the first, video game developer to appear on the show, and watching him share his fighting game knowledge while simultaneously fighting for his life is an entertaining treat. 


During the discussion, we get the first clip of Johnny Cage's Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin, which you can see in the photos below. It will be purchasable in the Kombat pack that will be included in the Premium/Kollector's editions of the game. 

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. For the latest roster reveals, check out trailers for Nitara, Sindel/General Shao, Ashrah/Havik, and Smoke/Rain.]]></summary>

ClayFighter was initially released in 1993 on SNES before receiving ports on other consoles. It received a 16-bit sequel, ClayFighter 2: Judgement Clay, in 1994 before moving to the N64 with ClayFighter 63 ⅓.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, My Nintendo rewards can drop without warning. Although Super Mario Wonder is tenuously linked to this new "Mario shopping bag" reward, it doesn't really have anything to do with Wonder specifically and could have arrived at any point in time. Still, it exists, and you can snag it!
[gallery link="file" size="large" ids="402718,402722,402723"]
It'll cost you though. This bag is 800 Platinum Points, which is a decent chunk of fake money. That said, it is in line with prior bags, including the Animal Crossing Dodo Airlines reward from 2020. The dimensions for this Mario bag are 18" x 14" x 3.2 ", and here's the rundown from Nintendo:
"This colorful bag features a selection of Super Mario characters on one side and the classic Super Mario series logo on the other. You can also fold it into an iconic 'Question Mark Box' pocket that makes it compact and easy to throw in your bag and take Mario and friends wherever you go!"

To this reward's credit, it does fold into a Question Mark box, so it has that going for it.
Need Platinum Points?
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked

A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.
Gargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few things are inevitable in life. Death and taxes, of course. And then there's Bethesda games having weird, physics-y ways of getting around its systems, as Starfield players are currently doing to steal their way across the galaxy.
On social media, various Starfield players are popping up with examples of using the physics of Starfield to steal some good loot out from under guards and NPCs. Usually, when you pick up an item in Starfield that you're not supposed to (noted by the red icon in the corner of its pop-up description), guards will be alerted. And, in my experience, they respond pretty quickly and violently.
While some games have let you get away with picking up the object and relocating it somewhere where no one can see, that doesn't always work in Starfield. Picking up an obj…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess Disney isn’t done spelunking through their 16-bit catalog since it just announced the 1995’s Gargoyles Sega Genesis platformer is getting a full remaster. It’s coming to Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 19, 2023.
Do you remember Gargoyles? I caught the odd episode as a youngun and really enjoyed it, but I was more into watching Warner Bros cartoons. I thought about watching it when I was older, but everyone says the show takes a sudden and abrupt dive in quality at some point. I’m not sure why that bothers me, plenty of shows are good until they’re bad, but that doesn’t mean they’re not worthwhile.
https://youtu.be/OYUJXoWh1yg?feature=shared
The Gargoyles game debuted in 1995 exclusively for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was fine. Some would define it as a game that doesn’t suck. I put it more in the camp of 1995’s Toy Story. It’s a licensed game, so you should set your expectations there, and you might be pleasantly surprised.
Unlike Disney’s previous 16-bit re-releases, Gargoyles Remastered is getting a full art style update and soundtrack upgrade. It looks pretty good, but it’s obviously built over the old game and does some awkward things with perspective and animation. However, if you don’t like it, you can simply toggle it back to 16-bit mode.
It’s, uh, a bit of a weird choice for a remaster, but I welcome revisiting any, so bring it on.
Gargoyles Remastered is coming to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. It is scheduled to be released on October 19, 2023, for $14.99 USD. There will also be a physical version available via Limited Run Games.

The company stopped short of revealing who is taking over the role, although it did say we’d find out in the upcoming release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which does not feature Martinet as Mario. 
Now, Nintendo has released a new video featuring Martinet and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto discussing their history together, the role of Mario, and Martinet’s new role, Mario Ambassador.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 was canceled back in March, and PAX organizer ReedPop was in charge of organizing the event, the first of a multi-year contract. However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.
According to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. 
“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”
ReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its reveal earlier this year, Mortal Kombat 1 has been unveiling its star-studded cast, one big name after another. Between J.K. Simmons reprising the role of Omni-Man from Invincible to John Cena being confirmed as Peacemaker, the roster is looking to be fierce in terms of both fighters and their actors. Warner Bros. Games revealed one more member of the cast in September: Megan Fox, of Transformers (2007) and Jennifer’s Body (2009) fame will be playing the role of Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. 
For those who haven’t touched a Mortal Kombat game since Deadly Alliance, Nitara is a winged vampire who hails from a realm called Vaeternus. It’d appear she’s up to the same old antics, as the Nitara trailer showcases the vampiress fighting against Ashrah, Kung Lao, and more. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,” said Fox. “It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.“
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah8VyRhiWiE
Again, Deadly Alliance was the last time fans of the series have been able to play as the winged vampire until now; though she was mentioned or referenced in Mortal Kombat: Deception, Mortal Kombat X and Mortal Kombat 11. Nitara was also present in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film, where she was played by Mel Jarnson.
Mortal Kombat 1 releases on September 19 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. "Irresponsibly large"? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe... less game?
We all know that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the gift that keeps on giving — even without additional content. But with how many juicy new skills and items, and with what Breath of the Wild's DLC delivered, yes, we are indeed still hungry for more.
But in a recent interview with Famitsu, Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma seemed to suggest that there were "no plans" to release more content for Tears of the Kingdom, saying "we've done everything we can to create fun in that world."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space will neither save nor free us. Like Starfield, it will not be glamorous or exciting. As billionaire jebends plot to establish their own corporate fiefdoms amongst the stars, our descendents' potential spacelives are looking as miserable as collecting 5 spacewolf livers. But I find some hope in spaceship salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, both in the overt plot about unionisation and in the small satisfaction of doing a job well. Head down, shut up, and focus on dismantling this spaceship carefully and efficiently. It's an attitude that won't save the world but can get you through one more day, and sometimes that's enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

While the first licensed UFC title was somewhat disappointing due to the underwhelming feature set and the series trying to find its footing as an all-new franchise, it was a solid first attempt.

We got code late due to an unknown random happenstance, but we've now put a bunch of time into playing it so can have a blimmin' great chat about Bethesda's space RPG. I sound like I hate it, but don't. James actually likes it. Nate has not played it but he asks us about it.
As you might imagine, the field of stars also makes up the bulk of our What We've Been Playing this week, although Nate is considering whether to start that or Baldur's Gate 3 - we give conflicting answers... Plus, some interesting recommendations, and Garfield.

PAX organiser ReedPop is parting ways with the Entertainment Software Association and will no longer be the production company behind future E3 events (thanks, gamesindustry.biz).
While plans for E3 2024 have not been cancelled for the time being, the ESA has informed the Los Angeles Convention Centre — the host venue of prior E3s — that the show will not take place there. This does not necessarily mean that the 2024 event will follow the same path as its 2023 and '22 predecessors, but a location change will certainly be in order.

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like "spam", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, a game sits at such a cross section of my interests that it almost feels made specifically for me. In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of "reverse tower defence", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of "I think I could just about afford that one day" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to "what [he's] been through" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think "this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to think that I'm above the lure of Cool Violent Thing in Videogame these days, but when I see a lanky robot parry a nuclear shockwave with a katana as though swatting a wasp, I find myself Enthused.
The videogame in question is Pyrolith's V.A. Proxy, which I've had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It'd be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

Are they just collections of sealed-off maps that fake the presence of landmarks such as named cities beyond their invisible boundaries? I just don't even know any more, but Starfield mod creators are looking into it. One intrepid soul, Draspian, has tinkered with the code to disable said invisible boundaries, and in the process, revealed that planetary maps do, in fact, join together, though as you might be expecting, Starfield doesn't take kindly to being treated this way.

        <updated>2023-09-06T22:49:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.
Nitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. 
Megan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game," Fox says in a press release. "It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. 


Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my cover story trip to Ubisoft Bordeaux in France, my hands-on time consisted of Baghdad exploration and contracts. The former was good fun – Baghdad feels almost like a 2023 spiritual reimagining of Jerusalem in 2007’s Assassin’s Creed, with plenty of rooftops and parkour paths to hit from objective to objective. But the latter was the highlight of my experience. 
I completed three contracts during my hands-on time, each at different levels of progression for protagonist Basim Ibn Is’haq. Contracts are essentially mini-missions that task you with eliminating a target, obtaining an item, or doing something like moving a boat to a specified location. You must scout an area out, find your target, determine the path of least resistance to them or it – Basim is all about stealth and spe…]]></summary>

And according to Starfield director Todd Howard, the game’s no-show status on PlayStation is actually a good thing, as it made Starfield “a better product.”

It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.

Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. 


An immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say "playing", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade. Let's dig in!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has garnered critical acclaim since its release in theaters last month. As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. 
Publisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.
In terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. 
The TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-06T14:04:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tilting Point has revealed Cypher 007, a new top-down action game starring James Bond, coming to Apple Arcade on iOS devices later this month. It launches on September 29 and takes players into "The Mind Trap." 
Because it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. 
Check out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond," the game's description reads. "This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program." 
Because it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. 

Cypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.]]></summary>

I compare this project, which seemed pretty much doomed at the time, with the globe-straddling free-to-play battle royale/concert venue/art gallery/Olympic sport/all-swallowing multiverse Fortnite has become, and I feel extremely old. My sense of time's crushing burden is not alleviated for learning that Epic are staffing up for work on "a new experience in the Fortnite ecosystem", which sounds a lot like a Fortnite open worlder. What fresh hell is this, Epic? When will enough be enough?

Despite that success, though, it seems the company is moving on from this Hyrule as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma has revealed there will be no DLC for the game. 
That’s what he told Japanese magazine Famitsu in a new interview, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Based on his comments, the team behind TOTK might be moving on to a new Zelda game in a new Hyrule, too. 


“We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world,” Aonuma told Famitsu, according to Genki. “This …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. 
But even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.

And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.
There is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

A large portion of '90s kids look back on Rugrats with great fondness. As one of the defining cartoons of both the decade and the network of Nickelodeon, Rugrats spawned its fair share of licensed video games, but last week's announcement of a new one still came as a shock. That game, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland, doesn't just feature retro sensibilities – it's an actual all-new retro game built in 2023. Though the first Rugrats video game didn't release until the late '90s, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland gives you the full retro experience, paying homage…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a "game engine" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?
You'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using "the same engine" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.

For context, that ties the best price we've seen for a 2TB NVMe SSD, although this option comes with a heatsink and is therefore a better choice for many PC and all PS5 owners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.
In a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. 
“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man," Pieces writes. "We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”
The studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. 


Alone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed three new Switch bundles releasing next month. One is a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes a standard Switch model and the other two are special Animal Crossing: New Horizons-themed Switch Lite consoles that include the game. All three bundles will be released on October 6. 
The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle includes a standard Switch console, a digital version of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and a three-month individual membership for Nintendo Switch Online. You can check it out in the image below: 
As for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch Lite consoles, there’s Isabelle’s Aloha Edition, which is a pink Switch Lite with Animal Crossing leaves on the back of the console, and Tommy’s Aloha Edition, which is a teal Switch Lite with the same leaf details on the back of the handheld console. Both bundles will cost $199.99 and include a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Isabelle edition is exclusive to Target and the Tommy edition is exclusive to Walmart. 
You can check out both bundles in the gallery below: 

These three bundles come just days after Nintendo announced a new Mario Red Switch OLED console, which will cost $349.99 and releases on October 6 as well. Nintendo revealed this console during its Nintendo Direct for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which we went hands-on with to preview. 
While waiting for these new bundles, read Game Informer’s Mario Kart 8 Deluxe review and then read Game Informer’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons review.

From the Stray Demons of Dark Souls through Bloodborne's Cleric Beast to the dragons of Elden Ring, you must learn not to be awed by creatures who look they could kill you with a sneeze. You must learn to run towards that titanic knight with the enormous shield, rolling between its colossal ankles, using its stature against it. You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a "land on every planet" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a "land on no planets" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? 


What if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

In the 22 years since Shenmue’s debut, I’ve played the game 23 times. Twenty-three times I’ve lived the life of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, watched his father die, and navigated his world and experiences. Each time I’ve realized something new about the game, the people who made it, or something new about myself.
Playthrough 23 was the most poignant of them all. I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.
More than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.

I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, "It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay." After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.
Breaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer. Players explore an area called the Overgrowth, collect weapons and gear, and fight off monsters. And though the…]]></summary>

Retro love letters are a dime a dozen these days. From titles that veer too close to the source material to games that take the kernel of an earlier game's original concept and expand it into previously unforeseen realms, nostalgic experiences are everywhere in the games industry. Yacht Club Games emerged as an early leader of this trend with its smash hit Shovel Knight, which took the 2D action-platformer genre and gave it several fun twists despite keeping the core gameplay and visual styles faithful to the 8-bit graphics with which many of us grew up. Similarly, Yacht Club's next game, Mina the Hollower, looks like a …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't have any firsthand insight to share on Void Stranger, which surprise-released on Friday, but when I read words like "forgotten labyrinth" and "traps that defy reason", I find myself reaching for my pen and inkwell, and when I encounter visuals that remind me of the nastier Zelda dungeons on Game Boy, I start vibrating gently in my chair, and when I see monochrome anime story scenes set to howling guitar and fuzzy chip tunes - well, here we are.
Void Stranger is the work of Finnish indie System Erasure, whose vertically scrolling shmup/mystery game ZeroRanger was one of Dominic Tarason's (RPS in peace) best games of 2018. The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People have talked about Baldur's Gate 3 going a bit wonk in the final chapter when you reach the titular big city. It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.
Spoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined.

While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.
I've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers. Let's put this proc gen through its paces.

That's right, this month's RPS Game Club pick is the alternate-reality detective adventure Hypnospace Outlaw!


Released in 2018 and developed by Tendershoot, Hypnospace Outlaw takes place in a warped version of 1999 where accessing the internet is done via a headband you wear while you sleep. You play as an enforcer - a moderator of sorts - tasked with keeping the users of Hypnospace in check by reporting any violations you discover on their personal web pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. 
But that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as "a giant interactive board game" that "lent into action RPG" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.

In the years since Sam Fisher’s last outing, 2013’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist, he’s made a handful of cameo appearances and even shown his battle-worn visage at a conference or two. And there is a remake on the way – of which we’ve only seen concept art. But by most measures, the franchise has been dormant for a decade.
Nonetheless, Fisher was once the lead of a game momentous enough to compete for sales with Halo, have Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid team taking notes, and find itself referenced as the graphical and technical benchmark of the early Xbox years. With two decades of distance, it’s hard to see the defacto mascot of novelist Tom Clancy’s video game offshoot brand as anything other than the embodiment of its ethos; the avatar of Clancy’s own stabl…]]></summary>

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving. So, it's a good game to check out on Game Pass, or at least flick through the opening chapters.

It’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.

Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”
It’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is a relentlessly horny videogame, Alice B wrote back in August, and that certainly describes the shock I felt when noted Githyanki grouch Lae'zel abruptly informed me that she was down to clown, a whole three hours in. "Ms Lae'zel, I happen to be a graduate of BioWare Sex University," I told her sternly, adjusting my robe. "If I'm going to have a torrid liaison in an RPG it'll be 60 hours from now, just before the final battle, and let's face it, I'm more likely to get scared of alienating party members and end up friendzoning everybody."
Lae'zel proved persuasive, however - "I like the way you stink," was how I think she phrased it - and one risque fade-to-black later, we were triumphantly entwined in post-coital bliss. Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem. According to Larian CEO Sven Vincke, Baldur's Gate 3 characters were accidentally encoded to have very low standards at launch. Haha, I certainly can't relate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the bigger Discourse torpedoes aimed at Starfield's glittering hull over the past month has been its strict division between planetary surfaces and outer space. Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. 


Players and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly "to" and perhaps even "between" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!

I’ve started to get some answers to the world’s intriguing questions and now that I see the end in sight, I’m not sure I’m ready to roll credits (although, like any Bethesda Game Studios RPG, the game continues after credits with faction questlines, side missions, and more). I could have last night, but my wife and I decided to watch a movie instead: Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol (one of the best in the series). I’ve seen it but she hadn’t, so I picked up my Backbone controller device for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and booted up Starfield to continue playing.

This time, however, he would the playable protagonist. His journey in Mirage takes him from street thief to Hidden Ones order initiate and eventually to the master assassin we see in Valhalla. 
Basim getting his own game is the first time in the franchise’s history that a character who already appeared in a different Assassin’s Creed gets their own mainline game as protagonist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newcomer studio Sonka has released a new gameplay trailer for its horror game, Holstin. This new trailer reveals a fun twist on the game’s shooting mechanics and comes alongside word that there’s a demo now available on Steam. 
The trailer is short, running less than a minute, but it showcases the game’s terrifying ambiance, throwback visual style, and zombie-like creatures that have seemingly infested the small 1990s Polish town Holstin is set in. It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. 
Check out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” 
There’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. 
Holstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

Around the turn of the millenium, 1GB sticks were commonplace, and by doubling that amount over time we've gradually worked our way up to 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sticks of DDR4 and DDR5 being common sizes. Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.
This new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.


The premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality. Intriguing, right?

A new trailer provides a new look at Gunbrella’s explosive, retro-inspired action. Players control a woodsman seeking revenge for the death of his wife, with players using their weaponized umbrella to blast apart foes or as a platforming tool. For example, you can use the umbrella to glide, swing, or slide around levels, among other uses.


We went hands-on with Gunbrella’s Steam demo and walked away impressed. You can watch us give it a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything "nice" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole "heresy" thing too far.


I'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having spent around 45 minutes in a three-player Payday 3 sesh at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm it's very… Payday. You slap on some masks, choose your loadout, then get to robbing banks or stealing things from crates. Often, it ends in absolute chaos as you mow through waves of coppers and rush to a getaway van. The number three might not signal a sweeping change to the formula, then, but that's arguably a good thing. It's a better-looking version of its predecessors that doesn't lose sight of the co-op silliness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Leftfield Collection is always one of my favourite areas to visit at EGX. Partly because it's regularly stuffed full of interesting indie games with often very neat and unusual controllers attached to them (which in previous years have included actual paper shredders and full-on Morse code machines), but also because they're often so new and hot off the digital presses that I've never even heard of them before, which is very, very exciting to me. It's a great little space to discover what will be the next talking points of video games-to-be, and this year's line-up looks to be no exception. Here are all the games you'll be able to play at this year's Leftfield Collection at EGX 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Borderlands 3 is coming to Switch, four years after the game's original launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and it's hitting the Nintendo console next month. Fans of the series have been asking for it for years now, especially since all the other mainline Borderlands games are playable on the console. Developer Gearbox Software is finally delivering and it's doing so on October 6. 
It's not just Borderlands 3 that's coming to Switch. Gearbox says it is specifically the Ultimate Edition of the game, which features all six content add-ons and a collection of bonus cosmetic packs. 
Here's what you get in the Ultimate Edition of Borderlands 3:

I felt it was so close, too close, to Bloodborne in everything from the cadence of the Chalamet puppet's jog, to the "duhhnng" noise of pickups, and the gothic sheen of its streets. At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.
But a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's "almost positive" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda "embraces chaos" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't "particularly fair".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally, it’s Lenovo’s turn to have a go at handheld gaming PCs with the newly-announced, Windows 11-powered Legion Go. It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.


These are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …]]></summary>

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

The announcement of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which acted as the grand finale of June's Nintendo Direct, caught many off guard. Not only is Nintendo moving away from the well-worn tread of the New Super Mario Bros. franchise for the 2D side of the series, but it is taking Mario in new directions with a larger roster of playable characters, unprecedented gameplay conventions, and all-new power-ups. The result provided us with a trailer that not only garnered a massive reaction online when our favorite Italian plumber turned into an elephant, but also had us watching the footage on repeat in an attempt to ascertain as many details a…]]></summary>
