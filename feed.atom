It seems you can't swing a Joy-Con around (with the wrist-strap carefully applied, of course) today without hitting upon a celeb promo for the Switch. The latest to appear is from Nintendo of America, recruiting performer Christina Aguilera and her family for another 'My Way' commercial promoting the system.
It sensibly doesn't pretend that the singer communicates with her family through the Switch Online App voice chat, instead showing video and voice calls on her phone. There's a bit of online co-op, single player and local multiplayer all thrown in, along with an OLED model - consider all the marketing boxes ticked!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Happy Home Paradise DLC is out following a surprisingly packed Animal Crossing-centric presentation last month. This paid DLC, which Nintendo says will be the last for New Horizons, offers players a chance to take up a new profession as a vacation home designer. The experience costs $24.99 on its own, but if you pick up a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Happy Home Paradise comes bundled in for no extra cost. So, is the design life worth the Bells?
With several hours, multiple happy vacation home clients, and even a promotion under my belt, my biggest takeaway is that this expansion holds little for you if you don’t love designing spaces. If you are drawn to Animal Crossing to gather museum displays or strike it rich in the Stalk Market, Happy Home Paradise might not be for y…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Tina's Wonderlands' impending release next year means not only will Borderlands fans have a new game to dive into, but they'll also have plenty of new merch to pick up and collect. Those who are partial to the Dungeons and Dragons-inspired Borderlands 2 DLC, Assault on Dragon Keep, and the expanded vision of that aesthetic in Wonderlands will have plenty to look forward to, such as this lovely piece available for pre-order now.
Mighty Jaxx is now taking pre-orders for the Tiny Tina & Butt Stallion (523 Edition) collectible. This "suuuper beautiful" 8" figurine depicts Tiny Tina decked out in her witchy regalia, riding on the back of the infamous diamond pony herself, Butt Stallion. In true Borderlands fashion, there's also plenty of loot that comes along with the purchase of this resin statue.

For the asking price of $199.99, you'll also receive a handful of additional items, including an Epic Games Store code to download Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, five character cards, two 4" Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Mighty Jaxx mini-figures, and 3,000 Mighty coins (a currency used through the loyalty program on the collectible maker's website). These bonus items won't come in the box with your fanciful statue, however. You'll have to verify your Tiny Tina & Butt Stallion figurine via a QR code through the Mighty Jaxx app to receive the game code, order the extra figures, and collect your coins. 
Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is scheduled for a March 25, 2022 release. While the game key provided with this figuring will only benefit PC users, the game will also be available for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.]]></summary>

Animal Crossing: New Horizons has had its major version 2.0 update, which includes a bunch of freebies and also the paid DLC option of Happy Home Paradise. A number of Team NL have been enjoying its charms, and a topic that kept coming up was the new content's ability to bring back lapsed players. It's also brought back daily play for some, which would have ended a good while ago for a number of islanders.
So, two of our team that have been buried in the game over the last week - Tom Whitehead & Kate Gray - gathered at The Roost for a virtual cuppa to talk about the update, DLC, and why time travel is a dangerous game to play.

You brought this upon yourself, you cheese-loving fool!
Ms Larson has teamed up with Nintendo so many times that we've had to create an entire tag just for the Captain Marvel actress: She's been on adverts for the Switch, played Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and even had a fangirl moment over Doug Bowser, of all people. Now, she's appeared in another advert, this time for Metroid Dread, but it's a lot more low-key than the last one, with the actress curled up in her trailer between shoots, we'd guess.

And you have to undertake it several times! The packing, the unpacking, the stuffing of old newspaper in gaps between fragile plates: it's all hell. And comes with the creeping realisation that your life has as much meaning as can be physically stuffed into a few cardboard boxes.
An extra special high-five, then, to Unpacking, which not only makes this stressful event a delightful puzzle, but also demonstrates that your life and things actually have incredible meaning.

This tool will allow developers to create their own "real-world metaverse" applications by using a real-time 3D mesh map to read the surfaces and topography of the world surrounding the user. Other APIs in the toolkit can help apps understand elements of an environment, while up to five players can be synchronised as part of the same AR multiplayer session.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could we see another Wii – or another Wii U?
Nintendo isn't a company that likes to stand still for too long. It has often innovated and driven the entire industry forward, such as when it popularised motion-control gaming with the Wii and touch-based interfaces with the DS. However, this desire to experiment hasn't always worked out; the Virtual Boy was a notable failure, while the Wii U effectively squandered the massive audience the company had built up with its previous home console.
Nintendo is thankfully back on track with the Switch, which has now sold over 92 million units and is highly likely to overtake the Wii to become the company's most popular domestic system (although debate still rages on that topic – is Switch a handheld, home console, or simply both?). The robust commercial performance of the machine has given Nintendo reason to consider an expanded lifecycle for the Switch, so we could see it remain the company's sole focus for the next five years.

However, Hidetaka Miyazaki’s Bloodborne often sticks out to me the most. The Victorian architecture, gothic time period, and nightmare-inducing monster design are fascinating but haunting. Even a character as bubbly as Pinocchio couldn’t change Bloodborne’s moody atmosphere, and this couldn’t be any more evident in Lies of P, a soulslike with some serious visual inspirations from Bloodborne that chronicles the journey of a vicious, sword-wielding Pinocchio. 
No, I’m not making this up! Just take a peek at the gameplay teaser below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back-to-school days have never been this weird.
There are few joys in life greater than a good mystery, but a mystery surrounding cute anime girls? That is even better. Blue Reflection: Second Light is the sequel to 2017’s Blue Reflection from developer Gust and publisher Koei Tecmo. This game sees a fresh cast of characters thrust into a new world, trying to unravel the mystery of where they are and how they got there.
Blue Reflection: Second Light is a largely standalone sequel, so you don’t need to know much about Blue Reflection to dive in and enjoy yourself. There are some elements that will spark the memory of returning fans but none of it is necessary to follow the story. This game focuses on a group of young women who find themselves trapped in a school over the summer term. The world beyond the school grounds is nothing but a vast, blue ocean. As if that wasn’t bad enough, they have also lost their memories of the outside world and must delve into the dangerous world that they call The Faraway in order to find supplies.

The Type 100 is currently overlooked a bit in favour of the higher-damage MP-40, but I'm here to strongly recommend you give it a go. Don't be dissuaded by the Type 100's low damage-per-shot: with the sright attachments, this gun's one real downside can be turned into its greatest strength.
Below we'll walk you through how to put together the very best Type 100 loadout in Vanguard, going into detail about what each attachment does for you and how everything works together to turn the Type 100 into one of the most formidable weapons in the game. We'll also talk about great weapons to pair it with, and the ideal perks and equipment to use in the perfect Type 100 loadout.

We enjoyed it in our review, highlighting that the original content is blended with all sorts of modern-day conveniences like better AI, shiny HD visuals and online play.
Online play is there from day one in this latest release after its belated arrival in Super Mario Party, and a trailer posted by Nintendo UK (above) highlights that nicely with four charming individuals playing online before meeting up for a rematch in person. It's standard fare for a Nintendo game advert, and that's ok.

The Tomorrow Children was released five years ago as a free-to-play game set in a unique world that tasked players with building villages and stocking up on supplies to stop incoming attackers. It features a flair of Soviet Union-influenced post-apocalypse dystopia to it, too. According to Q-Games, a “large number of fans worldwide [clocked] up hundreds of hours each,” but The Tomorrow Children was taken offline just one year after its launch.

The Automaton has an effective damage range that rivals the BAR, but its overall damage is much lower. However, to make up for the lower damage, it has a fast fire rate that makes it a strong Assault Rifle at any range. This Call Of Duty: Vanguard Automaton loadout will sacrifice some of that speed to increase the damage range, accuracy, and control, making it more effective at medium-long range.

It's been almost two decades since we got a new F-Zero game, which really should be a crime, or something. Still, if Nintendo isn't going to make a new F-Zero, then perhaps we should be looking elsewhere – for example, solo developer Aaron McDevitt is currently putting together an F-Zero-style racer by the name of Aero GPX, and it certainly looks like it could build on the good work seen in the franchise's N64 iteration, F-Zero X.

This is a familiar World War 2 funfair, where you’re steered through artillery strikes and down swathes of enemies like its whack-a-mole.

You don't have to be a genius or an 'insider' to figure out that Nintendo is planning more movie-style content beyond the Illumination-developed Super Mario film due in late 2022. From appointing Illumination founder Chris Meledandri to Nintendo's board as an Outside Director, to persistant rumours that more projects are in development - most recently with Donkey Kong - it's clear that a strategy is in place to further enhance key brands.
Throughout Nintendo's recent investor Q&A certain phrases are repeated a lot, one of which is 'visual content' to reference the upcoming movie and more. Asked about the company's plans to go further in this area, Shigeru Miyamoto was understandably careful to avoid detail but did highlight that it's an important area for the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to know the best Volk loadout in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? The Volk is one of the best Assault Rifles in Call Of Duty: Vanguard, but you’ll need some attachments to unlock its full potential. At first, the recoil is sharp and it is only effective at short range. With this loadout, we drastically improve the accuracy and recoil control of the Volk, whilst also slightly increasing its effective damage range and fire rate to make it capable of ripping through enemies at short-medium range. Of course, as Call Of Duty: Vanguard season 1 draws closer, we expect the meta to change significantly, so this guide will receive regular updates with any new info about the Volk.

For this level of quality to successfully cover such a massive and ambitious game world is a monumental achievement and should be celebrated with some kind of festival. A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.

How long is a console lifecycle? It really depends on the system, but conventional wisdom seems to suggest that it's around five years – although there are exceptions, of course, such as the original Game Boy.
Going by that accepted wisdom, the Switch should be entering the twilight years of its lifespan as it will be five years old in February 2022 – but Nintendo has repeatedly stated that it sees the machine at the mid-point of its commercial existence.

Sega has filed a trademark for the name 'Sonic Frontiers', which has triggered speculation that this is the final name of the upcoming 2022 Sonic title.
The new game – which was teased in May this year and is coming to Switch – is rumoured to be an open-world adventure in the same style as Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Sega had previously used the name 'Sonic Rangers' for this outing, which may (or may not) be a placeholder title.

Deep Rock Galactic got its biggest ever update last week, for example, which adds a battle pass with 100 levels to advance through and new items and cosmetics to unlock. 

There is a twist, at least: the battle pass is 100% free, and there's a new robot-battling mode included in the update, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wii sequel is darn good, too.
Sin & Punishment is a Nintendo 64 game well known among Nintendo enthusiasts, but there are also likely to be a number of Switch owners that see the logo for the game in the N64 app (for those that opt to get the Expansion Pass) and won't have that flash of familiarity. It's no wonder, too, as despite Nintendo co-developing it with Treasure it remained a Japan-only title when it launched in 2000.
It would be 2007 before players outside of Japan (and non-importers) could officially enjoy the game via the Wii Virtual Console, and later on the Wii U Virtual Console. The VC version drew in plenty of curious players, and then we had the brilliant Wii sequel Sin & Punishment: Star Successor in 2009. Sadly the series is now seemingly dormant, with Treasure's only recent output being the port of Ikaruga that was published by Nicalis on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft's Netflix-like video game subscription service and its library continues to grow with each passing month. This November alone, the service is gaining Forza Horizon 5, It Takes Two, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition, and more. However, the usual monthly announcement of Xbox Game Pass titles isn't always the only slew of games we learn are coming to the service. 
Every now and then, Xbox likes to tease some surprise additions and today, the Xbox Game Pass Twitter account began to tease...something. 
Things are going to get a bit...orange this week
November 8, 2021
This immediately got our minds racing: what could this game be? Our first thought was Valve Corporation's game collection, The Orange Box. Originally released in 2007, The Orange Box included Half-Life 2 and its two episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. This collection was first released on PC and Xbox 360 before making its way to the PlayStation 3 two months later. While it's playable on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles today via backward compatibility, it's not currently on Xbox Game Pass. Today's tease seems to indicate it might be joining the lineup soon, though. 
But what if it's not that? Well, we have some other ideas in mind too. Maybe it's the newly-released Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, a Smash Bros.-like fighter starring characters from Nickelodeon TV series. If Nickelodeon is known for one thing (other than slime, of course), it's the color orange. It joining Xbox Game Pass would be a great way to beef up the player count and grow the excitement around the fighter. 
Another famous "orange" in video games is Crash Bandicoot. Perhaps  Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is coming to Xbox Game Pass. 
That's enough from us, though. We want to hear what you think this bit of orange coming to Xbox Game Pass sometime this week is. Do you also think it's The Orange Box? What do you hope it is? Did we miss a classic orange in the world of video games? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

You might consider yourself to be a really serious Pokémon fan because you own all of the games, as well as a few plush toys and a (totally unironic) Ash Ketchum cap, but if you're truly dedicated to the brand then you'll have to up your game to the tune of $25,000 because The Pokémon Company has teamed up with the French crystal manufacturer Baccarat to present a trio of special collectable items to mark the 25th anniversary of the monster-catching series.
At the lower end of the scale, there's a 5.7 inch Pikachu figure for $440, as well as a crystal Poké Ball which is 2.7 inches tall and will set you back a cool $410.

Are you looking for a fight, mate? Are you looking for a fight? Sounds like the threatening enquiry of a ne'er-do-well, but it’s the height of decorum compared to the typical inhabitant of a scrolling beat 'em up. Tunche is no different, as its assorted jungle pests don’t stop to ask how you feel about being licked, whomped, or banana-targeted – they just dive straight in and gnaw the HP off you.
The whole game doesn’t hang around to onboard the player either. There is a lot happening from the get-go, with Andrex-length scrolls of lore and instructions, a home camp screen that soon fills up with playable and non-playable characters, multiple collectible currencies, and stalls where you shop calculatedly through skill trees for multiple character profiles. That’s not to mention the in-play pick-ups and the constantly expanding movesets of each of five playable characters. For better or worse, it’s a far cry from the pick-up-and-play roots of the genre like Streets of Rage or Ninja Warriors (both excellently modernised for Switch in recent years).

Not all of them, fortunately, but Intel has listed over 50 games that might suffer compatibility issues across Windows 10 and Windows 11 when using an Alder Lake processor. These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

Combining the stopping power of a sniper rifle and the close-range dominance of an SMG, Shotguns in any FPS are mostly ranked based on their capacity to one-shot-kill enemies.

Below we'll walk you through the very best Shotguns in Call Of Duty: Vanguard and what makes them so great compared to the competition.

And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game."

Unfortunately, fans might have a hard time playing the classics, albeit for a limited time.  Metal Gear Solid 2, 3, and the HD collections containing them are being temporarily removed from digital storefronts. 
According to the Metal Gear portal on Konami’s official website, a long list of Metal Gear games will be inaccessible. The info reads as follows:

But after 16 years at the company, the studio director wanted to try something new, and is currently working on a free educational game named PowerZ.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s 24 million registered players weave a tale of hard-fought success considering the original game’s shaky release before the reupholstered A Realm Reborn launch. Since then, Eorzea has grown with multiple expansions: Heavensward, Stormblood, and Shadowbringers, each introducing new areas to explore, more character jobs, and exciting story beats to bolster the already compelling central narrative. Endwalker is the next large-scale addition. The pandemic affected the fourth expansion’s production, and now producer and director Naoki Yoshida has announced a short two-week delay alongside a new Endwalker launch trailer (seen below).

The multiverse Spider-Man threequel is set directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home, with Tom Holland turning to Benedict Cumberbatch’s Dr. Strange for help with the whole “the entire world knows I’m Spider-Man and that’s affecting not just me, but my friends and family too” dilemma, as seen in the first trailer released. Dr. Strange uses a special spell to re-conceal Peter’s identity, but this is an MCU movie, so things don’t go according to plan, and the multiverse opens.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/07/the-new-mass-effect-teased-for-n7-day-with-an-image-loaded-with-hints"/>
        <updated>2021-11-07T23:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[November 7 continues to be the gaming holiday where BioWare fans celebrate their favorite space-faring RPG franchise, Mass Effect. This year, BioWare released a blog post full of looking back at the series impact and this year's release of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
The blog also details new products fans can buy, sales on the games, and even new Mass Effect-themed Steam emotes. A giant infographic runs down the numbers on big choices Mass Effect Legendary Edition players went with, revealing 15% of people did not recruit Garrus, an option 85% of us can't calibrate our brains or our hearts to leave that precious boy behind. However, there's nary a mention about the future until the end of the post, which says, "We are, of course, hard at work on the next adventure in the Mass Effect universe." We knew that, though, after a teaser trailer premiered at The Game Awards last year.
It looked like that's all there was to this year's N7 Day. That is until the image below was posted on Twitter:
Speculations are flying left and right, with thoughts and theories about every detail in the picture, from the type of ship parked at the lower half to the crew walking away from it (one looks Krogan, while the rest are humanoid, like most playable Mass Effect species). The crater located at the top of the image looks suspiciously like the head of a Geth, the synthetic beings potentially wiped out by one of the endings in Mass Effect 3. Now, I'm no expert on the series, but the similarities are certainly there.
We'll have to wait a little longer for confirmation on what exactly we're looking at here, but until then, we'll have fun watching ecstatic fans comb for any bits of information.
What do you see in the teaser image? Are the Geth for sure back in the ME universe? Does the art have any hints of how BioWare will tie together the original trilogy with Andromeda? Are there other space races you can pick out of the starship lineup? Please give us your best guesses in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first season of Game Informer's Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. This week we're tackling Samus' acclaimed Game Boy Advance outing, Metroid Fusion.
Metroid Fusion launched on November 17, 2002 – the same day as Metroid Prime. Developed by Nintendo R&D1, it stars Samus as she explores a space station overrun by shapeshifting parasites called X. Worst of all, Samus is hunted by an X parasite that has mimicked her appearance and abilities: the SA-X. Metroid Fusion served as a return to the 2D gameplay of Super Metroid with modern improvements such as faster movement and traversal and a ledge grab. Fusion was critically acclaimed as one of the best GBA games ever made; some fans even consider it a rival to Super Metroid as the best entry in the series. Chronologically, Fusion served as the final chapter in the Metroid saga for decades until 2021's Metroid Dread. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest Digital Eclipse editorial director Chris Kohler (@kobunheat) as we explore Metroid Fusion's lore, development history, and lasting impact.

Immediate answers might include punchy phrases/words like “gun feel” or “kit customization.” Even so, it’s hard to define the gratification that comes with securing that coveted victory in ranked multiplayer or surviving a seemingly never-ending onslaught in single-player horde mode. A good shooter tends to contain a smorgasbord of enticing components – gripping atmosphere, weapon/ability balancing, enjoyable arenas, etc. Regardless of style (e.g., FPS, third-person, top-down), the aforementioned features tend to mesh well with polished gameplay, sweeping narratives, and new or improved mechanics. If you feel at home sprinting through multilayered environments, mowing down adversaries with precision and cunning, then the ten games on this list are definitely wort…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Animated adaptations of video games generally receive more faith from players than their live-action counterparts. That’s understandable; most games are animated in one form or another, so it’s easier to replicate an aesthetic than to find actors and build sets that match the source material exactly. On top of the myriad of live-action shows based on games, there’s an equally sizable, if not larger, slate of animated series on the horizon. If you’re a fan of animated takes on the medium, here’s a snapshot of every upcoming TV series to keep an eye on with trailer links where applicable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skyrim’s 10th anniversary is upon us and Bethesda is re-releasing it, yet again – this time packaged as the Anniversary Edition. 
This new edition includes every piece of Creation Club content ever released, including additional quests, armor, and gameplay modes. It also comes with a new-gen patch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S players. When the Anniversary Edition was announced back in August, Bethesda revealed that the new-gen update would be free to all who own the Special Edition of Skyrim, which was released during the previous generation of consoles. 
However, those Special Edition players would need to pay in order to get the Creation Club content. A price for both this upgrade to get the new content and the actual Anniversary Edition was not announced at that time, though. Thanks to a new Anniversary Edition FAQ released today, we know the price to both, as reported by IGN. 
“The MSRP for the Skyrim Anniversary Edition on digital storefronts will be USD $49.00… at launch,” the FAQ reads. “If you already own Skyrim Special Edition, the MSRP for the Anniversary Upgarde on digital storefronts will be USD $19.99… at launch.” 
Physical editions of it will be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems, according to Bethesda, and prices and availability may vary from retailer to retailer. In terms of what to expect with the new-gen upgrade, Bethesda says “the upgrade will be free and optimize the game with enhanced graphics, faster loading times, and more.” 
All trophies and achievements will transfer over from the Special Edition to the Anniversary Edition, as well, except when upgrading from the PS4 version to the PS5 version. The Anniversary Edition will be released on November 11.

In a new interview with IGN, Infinite Head of Design Jerry Hook and Lead Progression Designer Chris Blohm discussed how the game’s approach to battle passes will work in the free-to-play multiplayer. They said it's aimed at keeping all kinds of players returning to it.

“We wanted to be able to say, ‘Hey, look, when you put 10 bucks in, you keep that 10 bucks’,” Hooks told IGN. 
That’s alluding to the fact that battle passes in Infinite never expire, meaning if you don’t finish a given battle pass before its associated season is up, you can still work on it in the next season. According to Hook and Blohm, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of a week in which publishers Square Enix publicly expressed disappointment with how Marvel's Avengers went down, the game has some good news: one of the most popular Marvelmen will swing in later this month, Spider-Man. Oh. But he's exclusive to the PlayStation version. Oh no. That's not feel-good news to lift spirits at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA CEO Andrew Wilson recently said non-fungible tokens and blockchain games are the future of the video game industry during a recent company earnings call. He also said he’s unsure of how. 
This news comes by way of PC Gamer, which reported on Wilson’s NFT-related statement during the earnings call. In a bit of a cart before the horse situation, Wilson made the bold claim that NFTs and “play-to-earn” games, aka blockchain games, are the “future of our industry” before adding that “it’s still too early to figure out how that’s going to work.” With that being said, it’s unclear what makes him so sure. 
“I think that in the context of games we create and the live services that we offer, collectible digital content is going to play a meaningful part in our future,” Wilson said, according to P…]]></summary>

Dr. Wu is Jurassic World's Dr. Frankenstein – a mad scientist who creates new life by sewing together the DNA of different dinosaurs. His hybrids are more capable hunters, better suited to handle harsh climates, and are far more terrifying than the Tyrannosaurs rex. In Jurassic World Evolution 2, we see Frontier Developments taking a cue from Dr. Wu. The dinosaurs players interact with are more aware of their surroundings, can find their own food, and even learn to hunt in packs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is reportedly happy with the upcoming CG Mario movie being made by Despicable Me and Minions studio Illumination, and according to Shigeru Miyamoto, more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported on the latest Q&A session section of Nintendo’s recent financial results briefing. In it, Miyamoto told investors that the upcoming Mario movie is basically done and that Nintendo is feeling very positive about it. 
Don’t get too excited just yet, though – Nintendo doesn’t plan on releasing the movie early despite it being essentially done. It’s still planned for Holiday 2022. Miyamoto reportedly said that Nintendo really wants to meet fans’ expectations with this Mario movie and that as a result, it will use the extra time to continue polishing the film ahead of its release next year. 
Elsewhere in Miyamoto’s discussions about the movie, he said that Nintendo is planning ot make more movies based on its other properties, citing a desire for people to experience said properties in a variety of ways (rather than just video games). He said Nintendo will make each movie one by one, though, so as not to have multiple in production, which could affect each’s quality. 
These comments come just days after rumors of a Donkey Kong movie headed by Seth Rogen, who is voicing Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, began to swirl around, as noted by VGC. Only time will tell what the next Nintendo movie is, but considering Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, who will be voiced by Fred Armisen, have already been cast, a Donkey Kong movie sounds like a safe bet. 
While waiting to learn more about Nintendo’s movie plans, check out the full cast list for the upcoming Mario movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale set in Midgar, will be released this month. 
Square Enix had previously stated The First Soldier would be released in November, as reported by IGN, but thanks to the new opening cinematic that debuted on YouTube today, we know the exact release date: November 17. That’s less than two weeks away and what better way to get excited about the dubs you’ll hopefully be getting in the battle royale than by watching the new opening movie for The First Soldier. 
Click here to watch embedded media


Set 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy VII, The First Soldier is about, well, the first soldiers that the Shinra electric Company began using on the outskirt battlefields of Midgar. As expected, the opening movie is completely CG and it doesn’t really feature anything to do with the actual battle royale aspect of The First Soldier, save for the last few seconds that show some characters jumping out of a helicopter in a very battle royale fashion. 
You can pre-register for the battle royale now and doing so could get you some pre-registration rewards, determined by how many people actually pre-register: 
300,000: Chocobo Egg
500,000: Shinra Mask Skin
770,000: Shinra Bike Skin
1,000,000: Shinra Utility Vehicle Skin
2,000,000: Shinra Helicopter Skin
The 75-player Final Fantasy VII battle royale will be released in 12 days on iOS and Android devices on November 17. 
While waiting for that, check out the latest details we learned about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier and then read about Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the other Final Fantasy VII-centric mobile game Square Enix announced earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami’s eFootball 1.0 launch has been delayed to next year, and the mobile versions of it have seemingly been delayed indefinitely. 
This news comes from a new blog post from Konami that details what’s going on with this iteration of eFootball. The team needs more time to develop the 1.0 update and squash bugs currently present in the current “demo” version of the game, which is what Konami refers to it at this point in time, as noted by IGN. 
“We would like to inform you that the v1.0.0 update for eFootball 2022, scheduled to be released on November 11, 2021, has been postponed until Spring 2022,” the blog post reads. “Also, we would like to announce the cancellation and automatic refunds of eFootball 2022 Premium Player Pack, which includes items that can only be used in-game after the v1.0.0 update.”
Konami says it has been working diligently towards distributing an update that will bring new content to the game, including a mode new to the series where players can “strengthen and play with an original team” and the mobile versions to the market. However, those mobile versions have seemingly been delayed indefinitely. 
“Unfortunately, we have concluded that more time is needed to deliver the product in the quality that will meet the expectations of our users and have decided to postpone the delivery,” the blog post reads. 
In the meantime, Konami ways it will release v0.9.1 to “fix numerous bugs sequentially on each platform” starting today, and that over time it will continue to improve and update eFootball 2022. Further updates and details about the mobile versions will come at a later date.
For more information, check out what we thought of one of the most recent eFootball games in Game Informer’s eFootball PES 2020 review and then read about how EA is considering changing the name of its ongoing FIFA franchise.

Call of Duty: Vanguard is a tale of three games. As is sometimes the case, several of the pillars lift up the package – and one brings it down. Vanguard’s campaign is weak, but multiplayer and zombies carry the title to victory. Let’s break down each experience.

Gold-foil covers. Uniquely numbered issues. High-gloss pages. This is Game Informer Gold: The same video game magazine you know and love printed on ridiculously high-quality paper. We've been working on making this high-end variant for over a year and are finally ready to reveal it.
Each edition of Game Informer Gold is limited with a small print run. Much like prized comic books, each copy is bagged and boarded. You may even get a hand-written note from me in the box it's shipped in.
We are auctioning off the first copy of Game Informer Gold during our 25-hour Extra Life Livestream on November 6. The auction begins at 4 p.m. CT and all money goes to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.
Want to get your hands on a copy? We plan to reveal more details about Game Informer Gold's availability in the weeks and months ahead. Stay tuned to Game Informer's social channels for that information.
I know you hear this often, but you need to get your hands on Game Informer Gold to truly understand how big of an upgrade it is. From its increased thickness to the gold shine on the cover, this is as high-end as magazines get.
Click image thumbnails to view larger version
 
                                                                                                             

In the months ahead, we plan on creating limited Gold editions for each issue. We may also reprint back issues with the Gold treatment. Here's a cool twist: Some of these issues (new and old) could feature never-before-seen alternate artwork on the covers, perhaps from some of the world's most celebrated artists.
We're going to have some fun with Game Informer Gold, and we can't wait for you to get your hands on an issue!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spider-Man is finally arriving in Marvel’s Avengers later this month. Specifically, he's coming to the PlayStation versions of the game – he’s an exclusive character, after all. But even non-PlayStation owners will be treated to a substantial update that adds a new Raid, power cap increase, and a perhaps friendlier method of unlocking cosmetics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to know which are the best guns in Call Of Duty: Vanguard? Recent Call Of Duty games have among the most complex weapon meta of any FPS games, thanks both to the sheer number of weapons and the absurd number of attachments you can use to customise each gun. Call Of Duty: Vanguard continues this trend in a big way, with 27 primary and 9 secondary weapons that you can unlock, customise, and experiment with.
We fully expect Call Of Duty: Vanguard's weapon meta to evolve quickly with future updates and balance patches, but at the moment there is definitely a top tier of guns which have risen above the rest in effectiveness. Below we'll walk you through the very best guns in the game and how to get the most power out of each one.

First released for the Wii, the game is a remake of the NES cult classic A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia. Players control the titular boy, with the help of his shape-shifting blob companion, to solve 2D platforming puzzles. Feeding the Blob jellybeans turns it into 15 different objects ranging from a parachute, anvil, or cannon. The game’s best feature: you can hug the Blob anytime.

A Boy and His Blob has since become a cult favorite in its own right. We scored the original Wii release an 8 out of 10. In her review, former GI editor Meagan Marie wrote that “...there is something undeniably magnetic about the game. The lush environments, charming characters, and the infinite power of the hug button make it impossible to stay upset for too long.” Over the last decade, it’s been ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and mobile devices. 
You can purchase A Boy and His Blob for $14.99 on the Switch eShop. The port is being handled by Ziggurat Interactive, which is also gearing up to release enhanced versions of the BloodRayne games on consoles.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two Interactive has reportedly canceled a $53 million game that was being developed by Hangar 13. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that “people familiar with the decision” have learned that “further development of an unannounced title in its pipeline” has ended. Codenamed Volt, this game had reportedly gone through multiple iterations since first being conceived but ultimately, what led to its cancellation was the repeated “reboots, technological hiccups, and challenges caused by COVID-19,” Bloomberg reports. 
Volt’s development began in 2017, and it was set to be centered around various superheroes competing against each other. It would have featured an emphasis on online gameplay. 
“It was set to be a new intellectual property for Hangar 13, but 2K executives didn’t see it as a worthwhile investment because of the amount of time needed in development before it became a finished product,” Bloomberg’s report reads. 
There have been no layoffs as a result of this at the time of this writing, and Bloomberg reports that Hangar 13 employees will meet Thursday in Novata, California, where the studio is based, to discuss what happens next. 
Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier, who wrote this report, tweeted out additional details about the canceled project and those affected. He said Hangar 13 staff in California learned today via email that Volt was canceled, and he also noted that some non-US staff members learned of this news from his report. 
Schreier also said this canceled game was not Mafia 4, which some thought Hangar 13 was developing according to rumors. He said Mafia 4 rumors “were always false, aside from their early attempts in 2016-2017.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darkest Dungeon 2, the sequel to Red Hook Studio's gothic roguelike, is a somewhat familiar affair. It's dark, it's tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we're leaving the Ancestor's squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they're excited to be working in early access again.

Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we've had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon's own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo has always had some great collector’s editions with each new release – looking at you, Master Chief helmet that came with Halo 3 – and Walmart sort of surprise announced a new one for Halo Infinite overnight. As expected, it sold out immediately. 
As far as special editions of Halo Infinite goes, there’s the Halo Infinite Xbox Series X bundle, the special steelbook that comes with preorders in select locations, and that’s about it. Before today, we hadn’t yet seen a special Halo Infinite edition that comes with what’s usually expected i.e. a statue of some kind, maybe some patches or stickers, and an art book. 
It seems Walmart had the lock on that because overnight, it released the Halo Infinite Collector’s Edition for $169.99. It sold out near immediately. It features the game, of course, a steelbook case (the same one being sold by other retailers), a set of five patches, a Plasma Pistol replica bottle opener, an Energy Sword desk lamp, two lanyards, a mini art book, a desktop portfolio, and a special developer note. 
According to Walmart, this edition was limited to just 10,000 units and now, it’s sold out. It’s unclear if more Collector’s Editions will be released. It’s also important to note that oddly enough, neither Microsoft nor Xbox have mentioned this edition yet. 
Perhaps it’s an unofficial one made by Walmart, although that would be odd considering it comes with some very official-looking merchandise. Maybe Walmart jumped the gun and released it early. All we know is that we’re very sad we were sleeping while this went live. 
For more about Halo Infinite, check out this story about Craig the Brute’s glow-up of the year and then read about how 343 Industries used Halo 3 and Halo Reach as inspiration for Infinite’s character and enemy design. Check out Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Halo Infinite after that.

First up is the Collector’s Edition, which includes the following goodies:
Elden Ring game
Malenia – Blade of Miquella statue (23 cm)
Exclusive steelbook
40-page hardback artbook
Digital soundtrack
The Premium Collector’s Edition includes everything in the Collector’s Edition but tosses in a 1:1 replica of Malenia’s helmet, which may or may not be big enough to wear. Check it out below. 
The Collector’s Edition will set you back $189.99. The Premium Edition briefly appeared for $229.99 on Bandai Namco's website but is a bit tough to track down right now. You'll have to pre-order from retailers fast to grab one before they're just a memory. You can try your luck at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop (disclaimer: GameStop is the parent company of Game Informer). 
Elden Ring releases February 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The classic and punishing Shin Megami Tensei franchise is back with a new mainline entry, and it’s full of everything we’ve come to expect from the series: challenging battles, intense demon negotiations, and philosophical conundrums about the state of the world. I’ve been playing Shin Megami Tensei V, already clocking close to 40 hours, but I haven’t reached the end to deliver my final verdict. Until then, I’ll say: Shin Megami Tensei sticks close to its roots – for better or worse. This means common series complaints, such as poor navigation and obtuse instructions, remain, but Atlus has also enhanced certain aspects, with more expansive areas, more skill customization, and stellar demon designs. If you’re an SMT fan, you should feel at home with the long, hard-fought journey that awaits…]]></summary>

It will present you with some of your fave maps from the likes of Bad Company 2 and the Battlefields of old, then let you tweak them as much as you please by adding various vehicles, rules and more. I'm personally hoping to see plenty of oldies with 2042's sweet new grappling hook thrown in. Every map could be improved by a grappling hook.

This news comes by way of Nintendo, which announced that Version 1.1.1 is out for Super Mario 3D All-Stars, which is the collection released last year that features Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Before this new update, you could only play these three games using Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.
Nintendo Switchソフト『スーパーマリオ ３Ｄコレクション』の更新データVer.1.1.1の配信を開始しました。更新することで『スーパーマリオ64』を「NINTENDO 64 コントローラー」（Nintendo Switch Online加入者限定商品）でプレイすることができます。 https://t.co/UmrwP6e8C6 pic.twitter.com/RHKN7g0tLo
November 4, 2021
That’s still the case for Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, but thanks to Version 1.1.1., you can now play Super Mario 64 with Nintendo’s recently-released 64 controller. Joy-Con and the Pro controller work fine in Super Mario 64, but for those looking for a more classic and nostalgic feel, using the 64 controller while playing is sure to fit their fancy. 
While waiting for the 64 controllers to be in stock again, check out why one of Game Informer’s editors thinks Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a great collection of remasters that doesn’t quite go far enough and then read about how Nintendo stopped selling this collection after March 31, 2021. Check out our thoughts on the latest 3D Mario game released in Game Informer’s Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now you’ve probably heard about how Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs shake up the previously stagnant Core line. Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'd think being 1000 years old would earn you some respect, but in Demon Turf, that means you're still a child. Admittedly, it makes for an intriguing premise in this tale of conquest and demonic shakedowns, but don't be fooled. While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard's monster-clicker Diablo IV and face-shooter Overwatch 2 have both been delayed, pushing their uncertain launches even further into the future. Blizzard had never stated a release date for either game anyway, we only had a vague hint that they didn't expect to launch them in 2021. Now, maybe 2023 at earliest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jen Oneal is stepping down as co-lead of Blizzard Entertainment, just three months after she took the position. Since J. Allen Brack left the company in August, Oneal had been in charge of the studio with Mike Ybarra, who'll now take the lead on his own. Oneal claims she's not leaving because she's "without hope for Blizzard", but wants to "do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Card games are all the rage these days, so much so that even Yoko Taro of Nier: Automata fame is getting in on the action. Alas, if you’re expecting a similarly galaxy brain take on tabletop RPGs here, you’re going to be disappointed.

Inscryption this ain’t.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a segment in a 2003 episode of radio series This American Life from 2003, in which a man named Dan Fitzsimons talks about a cable television channel he tried to launch in the '90s. It was the "Puppy Channel". A 24/7 broadcast of nothing but puppies. 

At the time, no cable provider liked the idea enough to make it happen, but I think about the story a lot. I think about it on days like today, on which Twitch has just introduced a new "Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos" category to the livestreaming platform.
