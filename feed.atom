Nintendo Switch Sports added golf to the mix late last year, and while it's seemingly got nothing else major planned in the near future, it's still being updated on a regular basis with some small patches.
The second update of the year (Version 1.4.0) makes some changes and adjustments, and also includes "several" fixes to improve the overall gameplay experience. Players can now collect items they may have missed before, and will unlock special crowns when achieving 'A Rank' in each sport.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Older CDPR titles won't be getting the same optimizations, though
If you've wanted to explore Night City on the go around your own city, then there's some good news: Cyberpunk 2077 has been officially Verified as Steam Deck compatible.
What does that mean, exactly? Well, the Verified system is a way for Valve to acknowledge which games are most compatible with its computer handheld, the Steam Deck. While many games can run, not all of them will run well. Some might have some issues with controller support, or new hitches introduced when trying to operate on the Deck.
Verified acknowledges that a game passes a certain set of standards, as outlined by Valve. This includes controller support, performance, appropriate input icons, and legible text on the in-game interface.
So while many Edgerunners might have already been tinkering around with Cyberpunk 2077 on Valve's handheld device, the game is now officially approved for the Steam Deck.
https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1630599572840906759
A new cyber deck
This guarantee of decent operation makes it a little bit easier for those who don't want to fool around with settings and options to simply play a game on their Steam Deck. It's a pretty good upside for anyone wanting to reacquaint themselves ahead of a possible expansion release this year, too.
While Cyberpunk 2077 got the Steam Deck treatment, though, older games in CD Projekt's back catalog aren't so lucky. This marks the third of CD Projekt's games to become Steam Deck Verified, alongside The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales. In today's announcement, though,  CD Projekt says there is no plan to provide additional Steam Deck optimizations for "our legacy titles." Sad to say, I think this knocks out any Assassins of Kings hopes. But at least the Edgerunners know they can safely plug into a Steam Deck run of Cyberpunk 2077 now.

These eight heroes grow into their own in their stories and then, once established in their own right, join together to fight the ultimate challenge awaiting them. Conceptually, it's powerful. In reality, it can be a delicate dance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After previewing Final Fantasy XVI for roughly two hours, which you can read about here, I’m left most interested in the different styles of combat happening throughout the game. Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

Publisher CyGames and developer Arc System Works have released several updates pertaining to Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising, the expanded edition of the studios' gorgeous anime fighter, initially launched on PlayStation and PC back in the winter of 2020.
Perhaps first and foremost, we received a super cute teaser trailer for a brand-new DLC character, Anila. The... erm...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like my father before me
Last Man Gaming has announced that their breathtaking simulator, Forklift Extreme, will be making the drop to PC on March 16, 2023. Available as Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition, this is the first time the title has become available on a platform aside from the Switch and mobile.
If the name didn’t give it away, Forklift Extreme is a physics-based forklift simulator. Using “ultra-realistic physics” to bring this favored pastime to life, you can finally live out your dreams as a person who moves things with a vehicle. Or, as the press release puts it, “lifelike driver physics for an immersive experience like never before.” Okay!
[caption id="attachment_366251" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Last Man Gaming[/caption]
The Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition includes all the game’s DLC. There’s one where you move furniture and another with giant pumpkins. That’s cool. Pumpkins are cool.
Real talk, though. The press release email opened with the one-person developer saying they’re just a “big fan of physics simulation games.” You know what? I’m a big fan of programmer-driven games. Reviews of the Switch version aren’t bad but aren’t spectacular, but maybe the package is a lot more enticing with all the DLC included. The critics at least seem to agree that it’s exactly what it says on the box.
I was driven to write about this because my dad is a yard foreman at a lumberyard in my hometown. A big part of his job is driving a forklift. I wonder if there’s an option in Forklift Extreme for racing wheels, because I’d love to see how he would do in a series of challenges like this.
Forklift Extreme is available on Switch, iOS, and Android. Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition is coming to Steam on March 16, 2023.

After nearly 20 years at Capcom working on combat for games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5, Suzuki decided he was ready for something new. 
That "something new" turned out to be FFXVI. The game’s director, Hiroshi Takai, and its producer, Naoki Yoshida, offered Suzuki a role at Creative Business Unit III, leading FFXVI’s combat design. And now, on June 22, players will be able to feel what I felt during a recent hands-on preview of the game: it’s very Devil May Cry meets Final Fantasy, in the best way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Fantasy series’ numbered entries haven’t been turn-based RPGs for quite some time. With each new game, the series moves further away from its classic turn-based roots toward a more action-oriented combat system. Combat has never been further from being turn-based in a Final Fantasy game more so than in Final Fantasy XVI, which is the most action-based game in the mainline franchise yet. I recently played about two hours of the game to dive deeper into the combat system’s mechanics, and you can read my preview thoughts on that here. 
But after playing some of the game, I spoke with the FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki about this continued shift to deep action and whether Final Fantasy will ever return to its turn-based roots. A…]]></summary>

Universal and Illumination are moving up the premiere date of The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The animated film is now hitting theaters on April 5 in several markets including the U.S., up from April 7.
While it hits two day earlier in the U.S., other regions will still have to wait a bit longer into April and May; Japan, specifically, will see The Super Mario Bros. Movie debut on April 28.
https://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1630599058564976641
Nothing's been indicated as to why the date shifted. But hey, that's a little bit of Mario slightly earlier than expected.
Warp pipe to the future
Before April arrives, we're due for at least one more blast of information about the upcoming film. Nintendo has confirmed that the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie will air on March 9 in a special movie-focused Direct. The company also says no game information will be included in this Direct, so bad news for anyone hoping for a Mario game to pop up out of the warp pipe.
And honestly, I'm not sure how much more I need to see about the film before I walk into a theater. While I'm still a little iffy on some aspects, I was already in for a viewing when I heard Jack Black's Bowser for the first time. Anything else, all the fun jokes and references, that's just bonus.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie hits theaters in the U.S. on April 5, 2023.

We are rapidly nearing the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie and the marketing campaign is in full swing. While we wait for the premier of the final trailer on 9th March, there is a whole lot more merch out there for us to get our hands on.
Perhaps the most anticipated of these was the collection of toys and figures from Jakks Pacific, which we first got a proper look at back in January. We at Nintendo Life were lucky enough to be sent a batch of these toys for closer inspection and our wonderful Community Manager, Gemma Smith, was kind enough to snap up a bunch of pictures to show off the range's detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a wait
Apogee has announced that Wreckit Games’ open-world adventure Elements has succeeded in its Kickstarter campaign and is set to drop into Steam Early Access in the second quarter of 2024, followed by a release on various consoles in 2025.
Elements is a vibrant-looking open-world game set in the land of Elemythia. The game gives some mad Breath of the Wild smells, but it looks to differentiate itself by providing some home-building mechanics and two-player co-op. The developer is also touting a “Hollywood screenwriter” and the voice actress who lent her cords to Princess Zelda in Breath of the Wild.

I’m a bit of a fan of Apogee’s reinvention of itself. Utilizing its name recognition for publishing small and independent titles feels a bit like a return to the company’s original manifesto. I doubt we’ll be getting a rebirth of shareware, however.
With that said, while Elements definitely has a charming look to it, I think I’m hitting my tolerance limit for open-world games. It’s a genre that grows and grows as the years go on but still somehow stays exactly the same.
Nevertheless, the people have spoken, and the Kickstarter campaign sits at around $200,000 Canadian Loonies as of writing. The campaign runs until Friday, March 3, 2023, at 6:00 PM PST, so there’s still a bit of time to nab a tier if this all looks interesting.
If not, Elements will hit Steam Early Access in Q2 2024. The full title is expected to come to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC in Q2 2025.

Tuesday 28th February 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of 1080° Snowboarding's Japanese launch. Developed in-house at Nintendo EAD with Giles Goddard (of Star Fox and squishy Mario 64 face fame) and Colin Reed (Stunt Race FX) on programming duties, it's a fantastic game — and a curiously straight-laced one by Nintendo standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still not entirely sure if I'm playing Phantom Brigade right. According to its internal clock, battles usually take less than a minute. That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.
In practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.
I am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.

One facet of FFXVI’s development I was especially interested in is how Creative Business Unit III, the internal studio behind the upcoming game, is able to balance creating this new title while continuing to develop its extremely successful MMO, Final Fantasy XIV. Yoshida, who is FFXIV’s producer and director, says it’s not as different as you might think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devils and angel wings
Bandai Namco dropped a new trailer for Tekken 8 this morning, spotlighting another key character in the universe, Jin Kazama. The latest Tekken 8 teaser is all about the longtime series lead and his moves, both new and old.
As Jin says in his new character trailer, "strength isn't everything." But he is looking pretty dang strong in the Tekken 8 engine. It looks like Jin is incorporating his devil powers within his usual fighting style for some devastating hits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkJQZ2Cz9-s
It's an interesting look for Jin that looks even better in the Tekken 8 arena. Tekken has usually impressed with its graphics, and that's held true for everything we've seen so far of the next entry in the series. Everything from the electric punches and slow-motion zoom-ins to Jin's best "One-Winged Angel" pose looks fantastic already.
Fist meets fate
Bandai has been drip-feeding out more and more characters from Tekken 8, though we've mostly seen the usual suspects. Trailers have spotlighted other mainstays like Kazuya Mishima and Nina Williams.
Still, even the familiar can be exciting when it looks as solid as Tekken 8 does. It's hard to get a gameplay gauge just from video, but it's looking like the next year or so could be a big one for fighting games. Street Fighter 6 is on the horizon, Project L is in development, and apparently Mortal Kombat 12 is happening too.
Tekken 8 still doesn't have a firm launch locked in, but it could be quite a time for fans of virtual scrappin' as all these new combatants enter the ring.

Destiny 2: Lightfall is out today, and the community is already buzzing with the ever-present question of every game release: "did you take off work for it?" Well, I'm playing it for work, does that count?
One of the last "take off of work" stories I can recall before I got into this gig full-time is Skyrim. I picked it up at a midnight launch Thursday night (early RIP for GameStop), took off that Friday, and played it through Saturday evening; which is when I cleared the main quest (yep!). I spent the rest of the weekend mucking around. There's nothing like a cozy atmosphere, fun food, and embedding yourself in an open world game. But back to Destiny.
Destiny is a breezy series if you're playing it casually
Having covered Destiny since the original game's alpha period, I'm no stranger to "taking off" (so to speak!) for these launches. The thing is, even if you're a casual player, most modern Destiny expansions have around a full day's worth of raw content to them. After that it's generally off to the gear grind, prepping for the raid, potentially doing some dungeon runs or Crucible PVP, and waiting for updates. But you can get the overall "gist" of the base expansion very quickly, and I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be doing just that with Lightfall today. Not a bad way to spend a Tuesday.
Weirdly, these kinds of live service games have a meta that typically involves gearing up as quickly as you can, and constantly running the toughest content so you can always be above the curve. So seeing players take off an entire week hasn't been out of the question. Either way, we're curious if you still take off work for games!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we’ve been bleating on about PC system requirements lately, but the spec demands of Kerbal Space Program 2 also demand a special, visibly uncomfortable mention. This game, fresh into early access and the sequel to one that needed a mere 512GB of VRAM, lists the formidable RTX 3080 among its recommended hardware. That’s a £600-plus graphics card, and for the bare minimum of Low quality at 1080p? That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. 


Consternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that "the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec." Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new fantasy IP from the ground-up
IO Interactive forged a name for itself through its Hitman series, but today it's announced a different kind of project altogether. The studio making an online fantasy RPG.
Announced in a blog post today, IO Interactive is building a new world and IP for an online fantasy RPG. It's built "from the core" to be around for years to come. And as IO describes it, it feels familiar, yet is unlike anything the company's done before now.
There are some touchstones mentioned in the blog post, ranging from Fighting Fantasy books that offered choose-your-journey opportunities to gathering around a tabletop. Heck, even being a game master.
"This idea – that a diverse group of individuals with different skills and strengths can work together and become more than the sum of their parts – is what inspires us," IO said in its announcement. "It inspires the fantasy world we are building – and it inspires how we build it. IOI now spans multiple distinct studios, from Copenhagen and Malmö in the north to warm Barcelona in the south. All studios take part in making all our games, including this new endeavor. People from all over the world with diverse personalities and skillsets are coming together to forge a new beginning."
Starting off on a new journey
Not many more details were shared, beyond the lone art teaser and blog post. It's currently code-named Project Fantasy, and IO is actively hiring for it.
IO Interactive has been building out the World of Assassination they started with the Hitman reboot, and are also working on a James Bond game, too. This online fantasy RPG adds another to the docket for the company, but I'm pretty keen on seeing what it turns out to be. IO's breakaway with the Hitman series turned out incredibly well, and I'd love to see what the crew does with an RPG setting. And, of course, whether Agent 47 is quietly lurking in the background. You never know!

The first paid DLC pack for Splatoon 3 is out now, and as expected, it adds Inkopolis from the first game as an additional hub area.
Players will need to wait for Wave 2 to really dig into some proper new content, though what this will entail exactly is still unknown at this time. For now, while the addition of Inkopolis is a nice throwback for long-time fans of the franchise, it doesn't appear to add anything substantial to dig into.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really, really miss Sheva
Here's an odd but not unwelcome occurrence, Capcom has quietly updated the Steam/PC edition of its survival horror sequel Resident Evil 5. The new patch, now available to download on the Steam platform, adds split-screen local co-op, removes Games for Windows Live, and stomps a few bugs.
Originally released in 2009, Resident Evil 5 saw former S.T.A.R.S. operative Chris Redfield head out to West Africa, investigating a potential Bio-Organic weapon sale, led by terrorist Ricard Irving. Teamed with BSAA operative Sheva Alomar, the duo soon find that this case goes far deeper than mere weapons sales, and will bring Chris face-to-face with some welcome, and very unwelcome, faces from the past.
He also punches a boulder to death.
This Steam update is a long, long time coming, and the removal of Games for Windows Live support eliminates a frustrating hurdle in playing the game. Of course, the Resident Evil series has long moved forward from its heady, tank-controlled, RE5 days, but for those who still enjoy running through the entire franchise with pals, then this new update contemporizes the release for future efforts.
Now, if we can just see to giving Sheva her grand franchise return, that'd be just peachy.

When we first loaded up Redemption Reapers, we were in love with the aesthetic of the game. A dark and gritty tactical RPG with surprisingly good-looking cutscenes and haunting music was exactly the palate cleanser we needed after playing through Fire Emblem Engage. While those strong points never get old during this game, they are quickly overshadowed by shortcomings in the game’s design and execution.
Redemption Reapers takes place in a world under threat of being overrun by the Mort. These endlessly aggressive, partially feral creatures look very similar to orcs from Lord of the Rings and have about as much characterisation. They come in a variety of forms, each with different abilities and skills to cause chaos on the battlefield, but most are relatively straightforward. Stabbing them repeatedly is usually the ticket to victory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stay out of Davey Jones' locker
Get ready to moisten your diving gear, as Camel 101 has given us a peak at their upcoming FPS horror title, Beneath. Beneath bills itself as an “action-horror adventure” and is coming to PC, followed by Xbox Series X|S and PS5.
Playing as deep-sea diver Noah Quinn, you stumble across an underwater research facility in the ocean's murky depths. I’d really be interested in seeing a game about a research facility that is just operating without issue and maybe just developing flavors of drink mix, but of course, this one is infested with monsters. Actually, why not both? Why can’t it be a drink mix R&D facility that has an outbreak of dangerously delicious monsters?
[embed]https://youtu.be/qrHElrB5J5k[/embed]
In any case, Beneath will have you plumbing the oceans and uncovering the mystery of this facility while trading gunfire with foes and various unspeakable beasts. Beneath touts resource management where guns are plentiful, but ammunition is not. Combat is appropriately tactical, and sanity is short, as you’ll need to keep your sanity meter topped up. You’ll also spend some time exploring the facility's interior and exterior.
I like the creepy aesthetic. It reminds me of the episode of the X-Files, Død Kalm. The nautical utilitarianism and oppressive shadows provide an isolating effect. Developers seem to have discovered the horror potential of ocean settings, so Beneath is going to have to work to stand out, but the initial trailer seems promising.
Beneath is headed to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. No target release window has been stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently went hands-on with Final Fantasy XVI, the next mainline entry in the long-running series due out on PlayStation 5 this summer, to play roughly two hours of the game. Most of that playtime consisted of me controlling Clive as I battled alongside ally Cidolfus Telamon (always a Cid, right?) through a castle dungeon. However, toward the end of my preview, I was able to fight Garuda, one of the game’s Eikons, while controlling Ifrit, another Eikon. 
At this point in the game, roughly five hours in according to FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, Clive has little control over Ifrit. A special few in the world of FFXVI are Dominants, meaning they can tap into the power of an Eikon and even transform into them. Cidolfus, for example, can become the Ramuh Eikon. Clive, however, is not a Domin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[L-Egg-O.
LEGO Bricktales released on Switch in October last year to a number of lukewarm reviews (check out our thoughts at the bottom of this article). The brick-themed biome explorer might have failed to capture the imagination of the building brand, but that hasn't stopped developer Clockstone STUDIO from coming up with more seasonal content for the game.
The latest update to be announced is going to focus on Easter and will be launching with the holiday later on this year. Bricktales is all about solving small-world problems across a series of LEGO dioramas and the new Easter world is no exception. This time, you will be helping the Easter Bunny make chocolate eggs by navigating a number of chickens through a variety of obstacles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game's developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. 
It's a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.
"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy," a press release reads. "Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games." 
As you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation.

This is a special version made for media to experience. Contents may differ from the final version.
Each of the mainline, numbered Final Fantasy entries takes a departure from its predecessors. The series maintains its thematic through-lines in its summons, its monsters, and in names like Cid; but each release, especially from the PlayStation 2 onwards, reinvents itself too. Final Fantasy XVI is certainly no different.
We got a chance to go hands-on with a build of Final Fantasy XVI, showcasing just how the next entry in the series will handle and specifically highlighting combat. And really, its combat is the thing to talk about, as it’s already been shown to be a bit of a departure from the ATB systems of yore.

Making a new Final Fantasy is a big deal. The series has been running for over three decades, and each numerical entry leaves its own mark. Final Fantasy XVI isn’t just a new RPG in a long-running series, but one that has to carry a legacy and forge its own path at the same time.
In some ways, then, the creative team that’s been assembled for Final Fantasy XVI makes a good amount of sense. As part of a media preview event for XVI, we got the chance to sit down for a roundtable interview with four key members of the team: producer Naoki Yoshida, main director Hiroshi Taki, combat director Ryota Suzuki, and localization director Michael-Christopher Koji Fox.

If you happened to find the secret chapter in last year’s superlative Bayonetta 3, you’ll already have been treated to a surprise glimpse of the art style and general atmosphere found in Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.
That secret area was, as it turned out, a short playable demo, one we assumed pointed to some incoming DLC for the main game before this T-rated spin-off was officially announced. With a family-friendly rating and whimsical storybook art style combined, we had initially guessed that this one was going to be a rather throwaway affair, a breezy prologue aimed at a younger audience that filled in some backstory and not much else.

Carson’s book investigated the pesticide known as DDT, its harmful environmental impacts, and the misinformation that allowed companies to indiscriminately use it. The Forest Cathedral reimagines this series of events as partly a first-person walking sim across the woods and partly a 2D platformer set inside scanning equipment. So, yeah, not exactly a one-to-one adaptation.

Revealed by the official Elden Ring Twitter account, this expansion is called Shadow of the Erdtree. Not much is known about the expansion, but those familiar with the game's lore (especially those that have completed the game) might be able to piece together what this new adventure will consist of. Alongside the news, From Software has released what appears to be a piece of concept art for the expansion.

This is exciting news for fans of Elden Ring, but given that From Software has only revealed the expansion is in development, with no release date or window in sight, it might be a while before our return to the Lands Between.

You might remember the location from 2015's Splatoon on the Wii U and while it remains mostly unchanged in its new Switch form, the graphics have received something of a facelift.

The development team for this one — FuRyu — is made up of huge names in the RPG field. We've got worldbuilding artist Yuki Nobuteru (Trials of Mana), character designer Raita Kazama (Xenoblade Chronicles), scenario writer Yura Kubota (Octopath Traveler) and even composer Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana). With experience like this attached, we have long considered the game as one to watch.

Fans have been clamouring for DLC and you’d expect a big expansion announcement to coincide with the game’s first anniversary - February 25th - but developer FromSoftware chose to celebrate the mega-RPG’s birthday three days later - this morning. In a Twitter post, FromSoftware announced Elden Ring’s first expansion called Shadow Of The Erdtree.

It's hard to overstate just how much of an impact Shigeru Miyamoto has had on Nintendo and the gaming industry at large. Indeed, without him there would be no Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Star Fox, F-Zero, Pikmin... IP that, quite frankly, have made Nintendo what it is today. So it's hard to imagine just what the company would be like without him.
Thankfully, Miyamoto himself has a pretty good idea.

We all knew it was coming, it was always coming, and now we know, for sure, that it's coming: Bandai Namco has revealed Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC expansion for its critically acclaimed and multi-award winning fantasy adventure, Elden Ring. A release date was not announced.
Aside from a logo and a single image, developer FromSoftware is keeping tight-lipped regarding the new DLC and its contents. The concept art depicts a haunted plain from The Lands Between, occupied by what appears to be the ghostly gravestones of fallen warriors. A lone figure (Miquella?) rides across the landscape, seemingly headed toward a gnarled, towering tree, pictured far on the horizon.

It goes without saying that the Elden Ring DLC news will make the morning of many a video game fan. One of the most successful releases of 2022, Elden Ring would shift somewhere in the region of 20 million copies following its launch just over one year ago. The challenging adventure title would go on to win an array of Game of the Year plaudits, (including our own) and, as such, the player base will be ready and eager to head back into its epic world.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

If you are like me, you have taken small comfort in Chris Carter’s reliable coverage of the event Pokemon that can lay eggs in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Whether it’s Charmander or Froakie, the inclusion of baby Pokemon has been a nice bonus for the past 7-Star Tera Raid encounters. However, while the new 5-Star Walking Wake and Iron Leaves encounters have otherwise followed the rules of 7-Star raids, there is one crucial exception.
I am sad to report that, no, neither Walking Wake nor Iron Leaves are capable of laying eggs. Trust me, I tried everything. I got the perfect Ditto, I made an egg power sandwich, I even played "My Heart Will Go On." Neither Paradox Pokemon would make as much as a passing glance at a potential companion. To answer your follow-up question, yes it was the DragonForce cover of "My Heart Will Go On." Of course I used the most romantic version, do you think I’m crazy?

This shouldn’t be a terribly big surprise. Paradox Pokemon can’t lay eggs, so your only option for duplicate Paradox monsters is to catch them yourself. That’s a bit harder with Walking Wake and Iron Leaves, as you can only catch one of each while their respective challenge is live. Since the event info does stipulate that these monsters “may be… obtainable through other methods,” it’s possible they will appear more commonly in future DLC. For now, keep your catches of Walking Wake and Iron Leaves safe. At least they won’t elope and move to Unova anytime soon.

The servers are officially down in the lead-up to the release of Destiny 2: Lightfall on February 28. Bungie has had some surprises up its sleeves though, as it released a very heavy blog post detailing all of the changes being made to the game during the server downtime, which lasts for 24 hours.
Amongst all of the details, one controversial nerf has been spotted by fans. One of the most popular Titan Exotics in Destiny 2, Heart of Inmost Light, has had a huge change which severely diminishes its effectiveness. In the patch notes, Bungie detailed the changes being made to Heart of Inmost Light. Prior to the servers being taken down, the Exotic chest plate was giving a 150% class regeneration buff in PvE activities and 38% in PvP. After the changes, this drops to 25…]]></summary>

Today at the Pokemon Presents presentation, The Pokemon Company revealed a new set for the trading card game called "Pokemon Trading Card Game Classic." Wow, this thing is probably going to make so much money! The intent seems to be to recreate the look and feel of the game's inaugural set, complete with classic cards like Charizard and Professor Oak. A special board-like arena and tokens are also teased as a commemorative set of sorts.
Billed as a "premium set that will last a lifetime," this is a joint venture between Nendo, Creatures, and The Pokemon Company. The Pokemon World Championship (held later this year in Yokohama, Japan) will provide further details on the set. For now, we just have the above teaser image.

In some ways, Metroid has always been a series about the tension between discovery and destruction. Nearly every tool in Samus' ever-growing arsenal serves two purposes: it helps her find something new, and it helps her tear it to shreds. Sometimes unearthing secrets is wrecking shop, as in the case of the series' iconic-but-divisive destructible walls. But Metroid is most interested in finding the line between investigation and annihilation in Metroid Prime.
Most would agree that the most dramatic difference between Metroid Prime and earlier games is the jump to the third dimension. This opens the door for all kinds of structural shakeups, but my personal favorite is the Scan Visor. With the Scan Visor, Samus can learn details about nearly every element of her env…]]></summary>

There are a lot of forgettable little indie RPGs floating around on the Nintendo Switch eShop, but it’d be a mistake to lump developer Odencat’s Meg’s Monster in with them. In fact, despite appearances of turn-based battles and an underworld filled with monsters to battle, we’d argue that Meg’s Monster isn’t an RPG at all, but rather a game that walks a fine line between the adventure and visual novel genres with light puzzles sprinkled in. It also has humour and heart in equal measure, making for a perfect little game to devote a weekend to.
Meg’s Monster begins with the titular Meg waking up in a trash heap in the underworld. She soon meets two monsters, Golan and Roy. Golan is quite happy that a child-sized snack waltzed up to them. Roy, on the other hand, has eyes only for an oily substance known as Magic Tar. However, as Golan goes to gobble up Meg, they soon find out her cries trigger an apocalypse. Golan convinces the reluctant and nearly indestructible Roy to keep her safe as they try to find her mom by smuggling her out of the underworld.

Edios Interactive is warning that Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: Cloud Version is being temporarily delisted from the Switch eShop starting on February 27, 2023 at 10:59pm EST. Wow, that's really short notice. This is due to a "publisher transition," and it's expected to be back up on April 1, 2023.
The announcement goes on to say that if you already own the game, you will be able to continue to play uninterrupted while the transition takes place. However, if you've deleted the game, they recommend that you re-download and archive it to ensure that you can still access it.

This isn't super-great for anyone who was holding off on purchasing the game on Switch, but it's not the most profoundly bad news. A little more warning would have been nice, but at least the publishers are being upfront about how long the downtime is expected to bad, and if you already own it you won't have your access to it disrupted. I can't really editorialize beyond that, since I definitely don't have a horse in this race.
To reiterate, you have until 10:59pm EST tonight to purchase Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: Cloud Version. If you miss that window, you'll have to wait until April 1, 2023.

Here's some fun news to kick off the week, (well, for me at least), as Forever Entertainment has announced a release date for the returning franchise Magical Drop — The sixth installment in the fast-paced puzzle series will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on April 25.
As we have previously reported, Magical Drop is a long-running series of tile-based puzzlers that was birthed in the arcade market way back in 1995. One or two players fight it out as one of a number of cute anime avatars, all based on the Tarot, in a breathless battle to group together colored orbs and dispatch them onto your opponent's playfield.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndKF-bUxFv4&ab_channel=ForeverEntertainment
The goal of this simple-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay is to set up your own playfield several moves ahead of time, so that the cascading globes will trigger a chain reaction of color groupings, inundating your opponent with extra orbs. (In fact, in Japan, the series is actually titled Chain Reaction.)
While there have been several Magical Drop sequels, the series has been on hiatus since 2012, when a Steam-released Magical Drop V proved to be a disaster — packed with bugs, threadbare on content, and ultimately pulled from sale. Forever Entertainment is clearly hoping to resurrect the franchise with this new release, which will feature six different single-player modes (including Story, Survival, and the mini-game filled "Path of Destiny"), as well as support for online and offline vs. battles.
Magical Drop VI launches on PC and Nintendo Switch April 25. PlayStation and Xbox editions will follow at a later date.

Surprise! Although we didn't get a new generation announcement or a Legends sequel, we did ingest a ton of news today on Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Not only are two DLC expansions coming, but the Walking Wake and Iron Leaves Tera Raids are live now, through March 12. Here's how to find them.
You have until March 12
The overarching Walking Wake/Iron Leaves events are already live, and will run through March 12, 2023, and the ability to earn these creatures "through other means" is vaguely teased for the future.
These event raids are exclusive to each version (Walking Wake with Scarlet) and Iron Leaves with (Violet), but you can cross over into each raid through online play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're sure of a big surprise
Developer Endnight Games launched its survival horror sequel Sons of the Forest on Steam Early Access last week, with the creepy cannibal battler seeing a sensational launch period, having raked in some two million purchases within the first 24 hours of release.
"Thanks to those who have joined us in our Early Access journey into Sons Of The Forest," reads a message posted to the official Endnight Games Twitter. "We have sold over 2 million copies in the first 24 hours, and are very excited for what we have in store for players in the coming weeks."
https://twitter.com/EndNightGame/status/1629252004156682240?s=20
The survivalist adventure, which tasks the player with crafting a habitat for themselves on an isolated island seemingly occupied by a horde of people eaters, (not of the purple persuasion), finally launched in Early Access following a long and turbulent development period, which saw the game miss its initial release windows of May 2022 and then October 2022. These days have clearly not dissuaded the player community, however, who came out in droves on launch day to dive into the nightmarish adventure.
Sons of the Forest is the sequel to the cult 2014 release The Forest, which managed to build a dedicated player base through its regular appearance on social media, Twitch, and other streaming services. With such an incredible launch already tucked into its toolbelt, it's easy to imagine that the sequel is set to become equally, and likely even more, successful.
Sons of the Forest is available now on Steam Early Access. No console editions have been announced.

Without even a minute to rest from the surprisingly difficult Pikachu event, Game Freak has given us another Tera Raid challenge to tackle. Just to keep us on our toes, this challenge is a notable departure from the events we've seen until now.
Walkling Wake and Iron Leaves are two brand new Paradox Pokemon making their debut in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Like other Paradox Pokemon, these monsters feature incredible base stats that will be boosted even further via the Protosynthesis and Quark Drive abilities respectively. Both Pokemon can only be obtained via this event, which will run until March 12. Fortunately, Game Freak has specified these monsters “may be… obtainable through other methods,” so another opportunity to catch them may show up in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh no, poor Kerbal Space Program 2. The extremely anticipated sequel to everyone’s favourite rocket-building space exploration game is a hot mess. A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.
The developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today's Pokémon Presents livestream, Netflix joined the festivities to announce Pokémon Concierge. This new animated series is the first collaborative production between Netflix and The Pokémon Company and features a decidedly different direction from previous animated adventures in the Pokémon universe. 
The narrative, which is told through stop-motion animation from Dwarf Studios, stars Haru. a concierge a the Pokémon Resort, and Psyduck. The stories that unfold center around her interactions with the various Pokémon that pass through the resort. 
"Netflix is looking forward to delighting fans in Japan and around the world with Pokémon Concierge, an entirely new visual and storytelling experience featuring groundbreaking stop-motion animation set in the Pokémon world in close collaboration with The Pokémon Company," vice president of Netflix content in Asia Minyoung Kim said in a press release. "We're also excited to reveal this new series on Pokémon Day and provide fans with even more things to look forward to on this special holiday celebrating the popular franchise."
Ever since spring 2020, Netflix has been the exclusive home to the Pokémon anime in the United States. While those seasons have continued the story of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, Pokémon Concierge represents a completely new focus within the world of Pokémon.
We don't know much more about this new series, but we did receive a teaser trailer, which you can see below.]]></summary>

After he left Square Enix in 2003, Sakaguchi opened his own studio and worked on turn-based adventures like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey - games that arguably matched his genre-defining classics - but PC gamers have been largely unable to experience them, until now. Maybe. Sakaguchi recently took part in a Q&A (reported by IGN Japan, translated by VGC) where he expressed the desire to bring his Apple Arcade exclusive Fantasian to PC.

The overarching tale, which unfolds over the course of two parts, is called "The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero." The first part, titled "The Teal Mask," begins with a school trip to the land of Kitakami, which features a big mountain with people living at the base. The Pokémon Company describes Kitakami as a "place of tranquil expanses featuring rice paddles and apple orchards." While there, the students can experience a festiv…]]></summary>

It’s also an unexpected remaster, redoing and fine-tuning everything from companion AI and facial animations to weather effects and dynamic lighting. It’s an enticing prospect for a game that never previously counted visuals as its strong suit, though there will be a catch: the Spacer’s Choice Edition will have significantly higher PC system requirements than the 2019 original.

What's happened here is: I've come away with thoughts, but they're thoughts on one of three modes that's the least useful one to have thoughts on. The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I'm unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think the headline I wrote is true. But I think it would also be true if it read, "If you sort-of liked but were also hugely frustrated by The Ascent, similar isometric cyberpunk shooter SlavicPunk: Oldtimer could offer a salve to your gripes." Bit long, though, as titles go. Watch the trailer below.

Boots Quest DX, however, has much humbler aspirations. You are a mere boot enthusiast on an adventure to find the very bestest best boots known to man (or blobs, I genuinely can't tell what provenance these rotund creatures hail from), and nothing else will deter you from achieving your lifelong goal. Find a honking great sword on the beach? Trash. A pirate's cutlass? Get in the sea, literally. If it's not a pair of boots, you're not interested - and it all makes for a brisk, anti-RPG adventure that's incredibly refreshing.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/02/24/nintendo-confirms-that-its-skipping-e3-this-year"/>
        <updated>2023-02-24T18:11:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. 
In a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. 
"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3."
Although Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. 
E3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jank. I am saying "jank" several times upfront, not because Spacebourne 2 is particularly janky, but because it is a bit, and I want to temper your expectations so you're not unfair on its flaws if you try it after I bang on for the rest of this article about how impressive it is.
There's a dream space game we all imagined, where you pilot a ship freely around the galaxy, landing on planets and space stations and running around them doing stuff, finding things, maybe having a fight, then get back into your ship to launch into space, where you can stop at any time and do a little space walk. Maybe walk around on an asteroid, just because.
Spacebourne 2 isn't the dream. But for a game made, as far as I can tell, by one person, it is an astonishing effort to capture that spirit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“At some point," says Joel Jordan, "Animal Crossing poses the question to you with alarming force: how do you want to spend your time?”


Allow me to open with the scoundrel’s refuge that is a seemingly weighty dichotomy: I reckon there’s two really special types of indie games. Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. 


So, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently launching this year, and that news was revealed rather unceremoniously in an earnings call with Warner Bros. Discovery.
In a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below.

Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. 
So who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?
February 23, 2023
Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. 
Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours). A story expansion called Aftermath arrived in 2020.]]></summary>

Game announcements are accompanied by million-dollar trailers, teased with reveals of reveals, and some fans tiptoe online to avoid the spoilers of a debut trailer. Meanwhile, films are often first revealed haphazardly through an excel sheet five years before they hit, or mentioned casually in an earnings call - which is exactly how Warner Bros. Discovery announced the existence of Mortal Kombat 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited to play The Settlers: New Allies. Not so much because it's the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.
The answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League got a lengthy demonstration at tonight's PlayStation State Of Play event, which clarified several things about what kind of game Rocksteady's long-awaited return to the DC Universe really is. It turns out it's a game with lots of floaty air combat, lots of noise, lots of loot and gear scores and weapon classes, and with a battle pass (but for cosmetics only). Plus there will be DLC to add new characters post-launch.

Set five years after Batman: Arkham Knight, the adventure centers on the villains turned government-mandated saviors trying to stop a global invasion by Brainiac, who has hijacked the minds of Earth’s greatest heroes.
Metropolis serves as the game’s open-world sandbox, and the adventure can be enjoyed alone or with up to three other friends in co-op (requiring an internet connection for both and supports cross-play). The video presentation highlights each Squad member’s traits. Harley Quinn is the most acrobatic, sporting a grappling hook to swing across buildings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.
The arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.
Likewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.
Lily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.
Street Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.]]></summary>

While it showcased many indie games and an extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the presentation started with a look at five new games coming to the recently released PlayStation VR2 headset. If you missed the live stream, here's a refresher.
  



      
												
Foglands
Described on the PlayStation Blog as a "western sci-fi roguelike," Foglands was the first game shown at the livestream today. Developed by an indie studio called Well Told, the game has you fighting monsters, grabbing loot, and trying to escape from danger before you're swallowed by the Fog. Foglands releases later this year.

Now, the trailer is below the next paragraph, and I know you want to skip right into watching it. Which you should. However, let me give you the quick hits.
Luis is present in way more of the game now – he's shown with Leon in the minecart section (also we see the minecart section) – we get a brief look at the Krauser fight, more detailed views of combat, the late section of the game that goes full Call of Duty (which is and has always been good), some brief glimpses of Ashley's sections, and a tease for Mercenaries. Okay, the trailer is below. There's a lot more I didn't type out because you aren't reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends. The game looks great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accompanied by a somber cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police,” Bungie rolled out a new look at Lightfall during today’s Sony State of Play presentation, and shared the expansion's launch trailer.
In this latest trailer, we get several new glimpses of the narrative that lies ahead in the expansion. If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.
It’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.
We won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.]]></summary>

Horizon Call of the Mountain is the big showcase piece for the hardware, and Gran Turismo 7 has been updated to include impressive VR modes. Outside of those first-party games, however, the launch library is mostly made of previously released VR games. The one other major exception is from Capcom, which has made Resident Evil Village playable entirely in PlayStation VR2 with a free update.
Resident Evil 7 received a similar PlayStation VR port in 2017, but I found playing that game in VR underwhelming. It was released early in the VR lifecycle when the basic mechanics of the new platform were still being worked out, and you had to play with a controller. It wasn’t ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a touch of poetry to the way Wild Hearts carves so liberally from Monster Hunter. After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. 


Besides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know it’s a great turn in The Pale Beyond when only five of your crew are freezing, two have frostbite, and one has scurvy. After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.
It’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on The Electronic Wireless Show podcast our interest was piqued by new trailers for a Jesus simulator and a politics in hell strategy game. We ask ourselves: why are there so many hell-themed games and so few heavenly ones? Is it blasphemy? What would our pitch for a game set in heaven be? (Spoilers for that last one: there's a lot of admin involved). We also chat about what we've been playing this week, and Nate orchestrates a mini-game pitchathon that goes at least somewhat off the rails.

        <updated>2023-02-23T15:25:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.
Bethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn't cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: 
Mikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.
It's unclear what Mikami will do next, but he's leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango's portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here's our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we're excited to see what's next for the veteran designer.]]></summary>

Developers Fatshark were taking the formula established in their co-op horde shooters Vermintide, throwing in some beefy melee, and moving it over to the 40k universe. Fans were less than happy with the end result, pointing toward technical issues, randomness in the endgame, and a lack of crafting systems, which Fatshark are hoping to fix in today’s update.

Original story: Tango GameWork’s co-founder and studio head Shinji Mikami is reportedly leaving the Evil Within company “in the coming months.” This comes courtesy of TrueAchievements who saw and verified a company-wide email sent to employees by Bethesda’s VP of development Todd Vaughn. "I am writing today to let you know that studio head Shinji Mikami has decided to leave Tango Gameworks in the coming months," Vaughn said. "Mikami-san has been a creative leader and supportive mentor to young developers at Tango for 12 years through his work.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I talked about a number of new features coming to RPS in 2023, and here we are with our very first edition of Ask RPS! This is a new mailbag feature where RPS supporters get to pose questions to the RPS Treehouse team (mostly video games-related, though not necessarily always), and we then answer those questions in public posts for everyone to get involved with. Easy peasy.
To kick us off, our first question comes courtesy of Old_Man_Gaming, who asked: "What was the first game that really grabbed you and dominated your life?" 
Come and find out which games had us trapped in the throes of childhood mania below, and why not tell us about your own gaming obsessions in the comments? You might just find a surprise kindred spirit.

Dead Space is a great case study, as Motive Studios smartly updated Visceral Games’ successful template while preserving its most beloved elements (here’s our review). To learn more about how the remake came together, we had a conversation with Motive Studios’ Roman Campos-Oriola, the creative director of the Dead Space remake, to reflect on the game’s development and success. However, there’s an added twist. 
Joining the discussion is Bret Robbins, creative director of the original Dead Space. The ex-Visceral designer has beaten the remake multiple times and shares the standout elements of Motive’s version. Additionally, he reveals the limitations Visceral faced while developing the original that …]]></summary>

Developers Hello Games have updated the game so consistently their launch woes are a distant memory, sent to a faraway galaxy. Since then, No Man’s Sky has become a not just a space exploration game, but a city management sim and a generally nice place to chill with your odd alien pets, all in one package.

Instead of waxing lyrical about that though, I'm here today with good news: My favourite open world 3D spaceflight/trading sim Hardwar is back.
It's been back for over a year, in fact, via Zoom Platform, who've just made the interesting choice to publish it on Steam too, promising that their own store will remain resolutely DRM-free, and that this aims "to help fund additional signings and improvements for our DRM-Free preservation efforts". I'll brush aside analysing this strategy, because the immediate upshot is that, hopefully, Hardwar might finally get its due. In a better world, we'd already be playing its modern descendants.

Its most recent twist came in the complete lack of ray tracing at launch, despite various pre-release builds having been held up by Nvidia themselves as the technology’s exemplars. Crispy critters, indeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation VR2 launches today, and the new VR version of Resident Evil Village alongside it. However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.
In a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We'll just have to wait and see. 
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month. Be sure to visit our coverage hub to find a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos dissecting the anticipated remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.
Each sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor.

With so much marketing fluff surrounding games, it can be nice to hear directly from the devs about their inspirations, struggles, and creative intentions. Hearing them chat candidly, making jokes and getting excited, is a good reminder that real-life people are at the heart of every game - what a crazy concept. Luckily, these types of documentaries seem to be increasingly common, evidenced by the Yakuza (or Like A Dragon) docuseries that just debuted on YouTube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often think about Infested Planet, a nearly 10-year-old topdown tactical shooter about holding off hordes of alien critters with turrets and careful expansion. I thought of it again while watching the trailer for Lumencraft, which seems to marry all of the above to a fully destructible world and lots more resource gathering. It'll leave early access on February 28th.

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.
Atomic Heart’s premise is one of its most intriguing elements. The game t…]]></summary>

Microsoft have announced the next four games hitting the service before March 3rd, alongside Atomic Heart which releases today. I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.


Here are the next batch of Game Pass titles:

Merge & Blade (Feb 28th)
Soul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)
F1 22 (March 2nd)
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)

This is my first time hearing of Merge & Blade, not to be confused with Mount & Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge & Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.

Sons Of The Forest was originally going to launch into a full 1.0 release this month, but the team ultimately decided on an early access release since it worked so well for the game’s predecessor The Forest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Presents returns Monday, February 27, with 20 minutes of Pokémon news celebrating Pokémon Day 2023. 
The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday. 
The next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩
#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉

February 21, 2023
With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

        <updated>2023-02-21T13:02:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has signed a binding 10-year legal agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players, presuming the company's colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. 
Since the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.' Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. 
Now, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: 
We’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO
February 21, 2023
Many have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with "full feature and content parity." 
If I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review.

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

From the look of the screenshots, I was expecting a creepy story in the vein of Little Misfortune or Fran Bow, but instead Birth is infinitely more introspective. Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I've ever played.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart’s long development cycle has provided ample opportunities to show off the power of ray tracing. From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.
I noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that "the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch." Well then!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jumplight Odyssey is an upcoming starship roguelite colony sim from the makers of Armello, and when I saw it in action late last year, I was extremely pumped for it. It was formally announced with its very flash animated opening sequence during November's PC Gaming Show Preview stream, but now you, too, can see what it actually looks like in motion with its very first gameplay trailer. Come and have a gander at its spaceship antics - or, if you're like me, just watch the two full seconds of a crew member giving Ham the pig a nice big belly-rub on repeat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After being stranded on the original Playstation for two decades, the time-travelling sequel Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition finally made its way to PC last year. It should’ve been cause for celebration as the classic Square JRPG had never seen a European release, but technical woes plagued the modern port and dampened the party. Now a year after launch, Square is updating Radical Dreamers with a “wide range of changes” later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. 


Oddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve played a lot of strange games, but never one that lurches between greatness and bafflement as hard or as fast as Atomic Heart. It’s a fascinatingly chaotic medley of ideas, and a rare FPS that lacks even the slightest whiff of battle pass-peddling live serfdom, but those ideas so often fail to gel that it can feel like a game made by several different dev teams. For a shooter set within an alternate history Soviet Union, it could perhaps have used some more central planning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see novelty games on Steam every couple of days; things like gun-wielding slime shooters, or hyper-realistic dog-walking sims. They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  


I Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. 


In fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. 


Lies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.


The newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
