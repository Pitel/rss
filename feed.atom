There are only two ways your sims can visit a hospital in The Sims 4: they must either be in labor or work as a doctor. Sadly, the hospital is not a visitable lot you can choose from in the Magnolia Promenade world. You can’t even choose to visit it when your Sim gets sick.

It seems like an absurd notion these days, but after Tomb Raider made its debut in 1996, developer Core Design pumped out six mainline entries over the next eight years – six. It’s true that teams were able to turn projects around much more quickly in those days, as evidenced by franchises such as Resident Evil and Final Fantasy, but it was also a clear indication of just how popular Lara Croft had become, and how much publisher Eidos Interactive wanted to milk the series to within an inch of its life.
The story goes that Core Design had grown weary of Tomb Raider by the time it commenced work on the fourth entry, The Last Revelation. Though keen to wean off Lara Croft and be done with the series, the team was ordered by Eidos to press on with even more Tomb Raider games. So while one group of devs reworked scrapped ideas from The Last Revelation to produce Tomb Raider: Chronicles, another moved development to the PS2 and began work on The Angel of Darkness.

The Switch itself often comes across as a fragile little device. The Joy-Con will drift, the stand will break, the rails will wobble. But never again will we say a bad word about the console's game cases; those resilient little guys can fend off the elements.
At least, that's what Reddit user DemureSow discovered last week after a fire from a power strip short circuiting engulfed their bedroom in flames. Fortunately, everyone escaped unharmed and firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze, but most of their belongings, physical game collection included, were destroyed.

It turns out there's an equivalent in Warhorse's recent RPG-palooza Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2: drop dozens of items in a random town square, and passing NPCs will gradually gather them all up according to preferences dictated by class. Here's a video showing that in action, created by Redditor Mcloganator, with three thousand groschen worth of goods to harvest.

Earlier this month, the current U.S. administration implemented an additional 10% tariff on all goods imported into the country from China. While the full effect of this increase is yet to be seen, it poses a potential price hike for consoles and accessories developed in China, which, naturally, is a cause for concern to both consumers and developers.
Acknowledging this, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said that the company is looking into the potential impact that the tariffs could have on the upcoming financial year and the launch of the Switch 2. As reported by Reuters (and translated by Nintendo Everything), Furukawa explained in a press conference that the company is "predicting various geopolitical risks and establishing ways to respond".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wizard creature type is a populous one across the history of Magic: The Gathering. Debuting in Magic’s first set, Alpha, in 1993 with the ever-present and not-quite-omnipotent “Tim” (aka Prodigal Sorcerer), Wizards have since become something of a mascot creature type for the game.


With over 1,000 Wizards now populating Magic, blue dominates the type with over 500 Wizards in their ranks. Green brings up the rear in terms of sorcerous sundries with only 32 Wizard creatures. But all colors feature at least 30 Wizards, so it’s a creature type that you’re sure to run into when playing Commander – but what are the best Wizard cards for the format?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second Tomb Raider trilogy and the third entry in Saber's grand Tomb Raider and Soul Reaver restoration effort is now out. It's time to find out if the developers treated this divisive batch of Tomb Raider games well enough to see them soar to never-before-seen heights.


In my review of the I-III trilogy, I discussed the great, the good, and the lackluster about the remasters — which was very little, it turned out. I could afford to do that as the three games were very similar. This time, however, I'm covering the base elements that carried over from the previous remaster trilogy, then doing a necessarily separate look into each of these three distinct titles.

Here's our guide to creating the best Fighter build in Avowed.


Best Attributes for a Fighter


At the start of the game, you get 10 points to distribute on your attributes, with three points being the maximum. An ideal Fighter needs to invest right from the get-go into both Constitution and Might. Those two attributes will help you withstand a good amount of punishment, and offer higher than average HP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warriors: Abyss has 100 heroes to obtain and use in the game, but most of them will be locked when you begin your journey.


21 heroes are available by default when you start the game. While these characters are pretty powerful for beginners, there are better ones to unlock for the future. Every hero offers unique abilities and buffs, and they can be unlocked by earning in-game resources.


How to get all characters in Warriors: Abyss


To start the process, you'll have to play with one of the 21 characters available. However, you'll notice a section called Hall of Bonded Souls. It's impossible to miss as the tutorial will also describe it to you. You'll be able to unlock and add new heroes from this section and use them on your quests.


You'll need a currency called Karma Embers. You can earn this currency whenever you complete a run, and the number will vary based on difficulty. You'll also earn this currency by unlocking different chests during the runs.


Image via Destructoid


Once you've obtained Karma Embers, you'll be able to unlock the heroes and then use them during a run. Some, like Daqiao, are really cheap to unlock, as you'll need between 100-200 Karma Embers. Others, like Nobunaga Oda, are towards the higher end and cost 4000 Karma Embers or more. Of course, any hero, once unlocked, will remain available for all runs.


Once you have enough Karma Embers, you'll be able to "Form Bond" to unlock the character.


Unlocking all the available characters will take time, but you should focus on some of the more meta ones for starters. They will help you go deeper on your runs and obtain more rewards. Make sure to check out our guide on the tier list for all starter heroes.


Here's a guide if you're looking for a summary of all the unlockable characters and how much they cost to unlock.

(Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled "Admire", "Joke", "Coerce" and "Boast", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. 
You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying "pie" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not one of the hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a gamedev community knockabout dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement.

How to set up a party camp in Avowed


As you start exploring each region in Avowed, you will find several places where you can set up a party camp. You can do this around what the game refers to as Adra Waystones. These are big green rocks that give off a purplish haze (sorry Jimi Hendrix).


Once you interact with them, you can set up a camp and they will stay on the map as little tent icons you can quickly refer to. This is a 100% safe zone, meaning that enemies cannot approach you and you will be able to recover back to full health once you rest.

According to Fortnite Wiki, Wanna See Me last appeared in the shop on August 16, 2022, making this its first return in 916 days. The emote makes the character dance smoothly and playfully to "Whole Lotta Choppas" by Sada Baby. Curious to see how Wanna See Me looks in action? Check out the in-game animation in the video below.



    
Video by Destructoid


Wanna See Me is returning along with other highly requested ICON Series emotes such as Rollie, Evil Plan, and Chicken Wing It, which are all parts of different collaborations between Epic Games and artists. Fortnite’s ICON Series emotes, especially those tied to music artists, tend to have limited availability due to licensing agreements. These deals often prevent Epic Games from re-releasing emotes unless they renegotiate with the original partners. This is why some emotes, like Wanna See Me, return after years of absence, while others remain missing for even longer.


While Wanna See Me has become rare after this long wait of two and a half years, some players on social media were surprisingly unexcited about its return, but mostly because they'd rather see other emotes like Mine and Line Dancin'.






Other ICON Series emotes even rarer than Wanna See Me include Head Banger from the Travis Scott set, last seen over 1,700 days ago (almost five years), and Lazer Blast, a Major Lazer dance last seen 1,345 days ago (almost four years). Whether these emotes will ever return to Fortnite remains unclear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not Abyssmal.
During Sony’s February 2025 State of Play presentation, the big shadow drop was Koei Tecmo’s Warriors: Abyss, which offers a low-budget, roguelite take on the popular Warriors hack ‘n’ slash formula. The good news is that this genre hybrid feels like both halves fit perfectly together—the mindlessness of the combat mixed with the brief run-focused nature of roguelite action is so good that it almost feels hard to believe that the team never thought to produce something like this earlier. The bad news is that its struggles with repetition keep it from being anywhere near as addictive as roguelikes such as Dead Cells or Slay the Spire. Luckily, Warriors: Abyss still proves itself to be a worthwhile new entry in the series, but only just.
Warriors: Abyss begins with you being summoned by an impish little god named Enma, the king of Hell, who was recently deposed when an ancient evil being named Gouma was released and took over the land of the dead. Eager to reclaim his throne, Enma enlists the stars of the Warriors franchise to fight off Gouma’s forces and ultimately send the creature back where it came from. Every now and then, Enma will pop up with a bit more of lore or some snarky quip, but there’s not much more to the storyline beyond this basic setup.

A new report from Insider Gaming (thanks, Eurogamer) has revealed that multiple layoffs have occurred at studio 10:10 Games following the release of Funko Fusion in 2024.
Essentially, anonymous sources have stated that the game was a "complete commercial and critical failure" and is the primary catalyst behind around 20 unconfirmed job losses. According to the sources, some of those let go were also on holiday at the time, and felt obligated to attend consultation meetings despite being on leave and within different time zones.

This build will focus on its strengths since the secondary glaive fire is excellent for crowd control and priming targets for increased damage per status effect. To start, use this mod setup:



Galvanized Hell


Atomic Fallout


Critical Deceleration / Blunderbuss

Developer Toby Fox is back with another update on the much-anticipated Deltarune Chapter 3 and 4, inching toward an as-yet unknown release date that is still promised to come later this year.
In short, console testing is still ongoing. Our assumption here is that the Switch is included in these tests, but Fox has not specified this in the BlueSky post. Instead, he merely states that testing has yet to begin on the PS5, with a previous post stating that PlayStation trophies will need to be tested at some point due to their mandatory requirement.

How to upgrade your Gear in Avowed


Upgrading your gear is rather simplistic. The first thing you want to do is travel to your Party Camp. This is your main base of operations throughout Avowed, and it's also the only place where you can perform enchantments and enhance your gear.


Once you've made it to your Party Camp, head over to your camp's Workbench and interact with it when you get close.

Xbox games going multiplatform is old news by this point, but according to Phil Spencer, the company is looking to up its transparency during Developer Direct showcases when it comes to specifying where its games are launching.
Those paying attention during last month's Xbox dev direct may have noticed launch platforms cropping up at the end of each trailer — not that there was all that much on the Switch front, but PS5 was specifically mentioned for Ninja Gaiden 4, for example — and Xbox is going to adopt this as a common practice going forward.

The three minute, 12 second sorcerer run by Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski was first uploaded to Speed Demos Archive in 2009. Watching it "feels like watching someone win the lottery," writes Orland, thanks to a seemingly random streak of entrance and exit stairways right next to each other, allowing for a rapid, safe descent through the dungeon. Groobo lucked out again on the ninth floor, nabbing the Naj's Puzzler item needed for later teleporting exploits.

Still, can't complain, and the Switch version in particular has done pretty well, outselling PC and Xbox to claim 27% of the overall platform split. Granted, PC is barely operational in retail spaces these days, and Xbox... well, neither is Xbox, to be honest. We'll take the win, though.

We have been following Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit for the best part of six months now, and while we have grown to have a better understanding of the particular patents involved, all of the infringement claims have been tied to Japan. However, in recent months, it seems that Nintendo has been preparing to bring the lawsuit stateside, with a handful of applications now appearing in the US Patent Office.
As reported by Games Fray, Nintendo has had three patent applications approved in the US in recent months — no. 12179111 in December 2024, 12194382 in January, and 12220638 earlier this week on 11th February. While the middle of the three doesn't appear to be all that relevant to the Palworld case (it was filed in 2022 and is all about exchanging items with other players), the remaining two were filed after Palworld's launch and specifically detail creature-catching mechanics — the specifics of which appear to be integral to the lawsuit in Japan.

Anyway, now for the best part of the week! No, not the playing of games. The talking about the playing of games! Whether the playing of games actually happens is inconsequential. Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

The popular team-based hero title Marvel Rivals has experienced an incredibly successful launch and as it continues to grow developer NetEase Games is looking at new ways to expand the experience. While it's reportedly ruled out a release on the original Switch, it seems there's a real chance of the game coming to the Switch 2.
Speaking to IGN at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu mentioned how the team was "already in contact with Nintendo" and was apparently "working on some development kits", so the decision will come down to how the game performs on the system:

It’s the sad, sleepy tale of a musician, Rama, who is trying to put his life back together and reconnect with his old bandmates in Jakarta a year after the death of his girlfriend, Cinta. The complicating factor is that Cinta isn’t entirely gone: she is a voice in Rama’s head, chatting to him throughout the game's 28-day storyline as though sitting next to the player on the other side of the screen.

We were more than a little surprised when Hideki Kamiya and Capcom popped up at The Game Awards to announce an Okami sequel. Surprised, but excited. The title is still in early development and we know very little about it, but in a recent interview with IGN, some of its creatives began to explain what we can expect from the sequel and how it'll fit with the series' previous entries.
Throughout the interview with Kamiya, Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, and Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata, the trio refer to the upcoming sequel as "a continuation of the story that we saw in the original game". But, as any Okami fan will be able to tell you, we've already seen a follow-up (of sorts) in the 2011 DS follow-up, Okamiden.

In the interests of a more productive outcome, here are some lovely/interesting/terrifying little PC games that I could have started and finished while waiting for the closed beta to sort itself out, and that you might enjoy regardless of whether you’ve just spaffed away a perfectly good afternoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something uncanny about dipping "classic" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a fan of Switch Online, huh?
Before Nintendo Switch Online, there was Virtual Console. Available on the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U, the Virtual Console was effectively a line of purchasable retro games available via the Wii Shop Channel and eShop.
Unlike Nintendo Switch Online, which offers up a range of playable games for an annual or monthly cost, Virtual Console allowed you pay for games ad-hoc, enabling you to download whichever title you wanted and keep it indefinitely. While we certainly love what Nintendo has been doing with Switch Online over the years, it's no secret that lots of fans would rather the firm revert back to the Virtual Console model.

We are quickly closing in on Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma's 30th May release date and, with love in the air this Valentine's Day, publisher Marvelous! has shared a pair of new trailers to introduce the game's romance candidates.
Broken into 'Meet the Bachelors' and 'Meet the Bachelorettes,' the trailers showcase all 16 (yes, sixteen) romance options for the upcoming Rune Factory RPG. As you'd hope, every candidate seems to pack a dramatic backstory and lofty ambitions, with their titles spanning the full range of ridiculousness from the relatively tame 'Wandering Hero' to 'Prestigious God of Light and the Heavens" — damn, we know which one we'd rather add to our LinkedIn.

The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we're back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian's latest RPG Avowed. We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!
Nic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?
James: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.
Otherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.
Nic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to "come hither" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.
It's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?

Developed by South Korean studio Shift Up and published by Sony, it's about fighting monsters on post-apocalyptic Earth by means of combos, parries and gauge-based super moves. It's got an open world full of NPC quest-givers and creatures designed by Hee-Cheol Jang, the mad scientist behind the menageries of Okja and The Host. It's also got a protagonist we can summarise as Bayonetta played straight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed is almost good, but there's something so resigned and workmanlike to its quest design and storytelling that it often feels like dog-eared chorelist of Obsidian must-haves, ticked off so aimlessly that the result is a bit like having an RPG described to you by someone late for a bus.
And that should be that, really. I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.
But, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.
Ignore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.

Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of "fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true," claiming his former company was "targeted" by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.

But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool Asteroid Launcher, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.

Among the teasers and crossover announcements, 2K revealed the release date for Borderlands 4 in a short 'n' shooty trailer. I'm not a big fan of this long-running looter shooter. But in showing us its release date Take-Two have given us an indication of when Grand Theft Auto 6 will not release. And that's mildly interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Returnal studio Housemarque sound like they're aiming to put more emphasis on the lite part of the roguelite formula with Saros, their next loop 'em up space shooter arriving exclusive to PlayStation 5 next year and likely on PC sometime after that, if past time loops are anything to go on.
You'll be exploring a lost space colony as Arjun Devraj, a "Soltari Enforcer" played by Midnight Mass actor and big nerd Rahul Kohli. The planet you're on is named 'Carcosa', perhaps suggesting a continuation of the cosmic horror bits that Returnal did so well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French football clubs held emergency talks after broadcaster DAZN withheld millions of euros in TV rights payments due this month. The dispute concerns DAZN's claims that Ligue 1 football league body LFP failed to suppress piracy and fell short in other areas too. Hopes of an amicable solution faded when DAZN paid 50% of the sum owed for February and put the other €35 million into an escrow account.  LFP responded by launching legal action in Paris.

Film Captain America: Nový svět (který má v úvodních titulcích pouze "Brave New World" a žádného Captaina) je pravděpodobně začátkem nové filmové megasérie, která nám v příštích filmech pravděpodobně představí "nové" Avengers, nové X-Men a pravděpodobně také nové multiverzní nebezpečí. Píšu několikrát "pravděpodobně", protože musím přiznat, že se v aktuálním Marvel vesmíru neorientuji tolik, jako jsem se v minulých desetiletích orientoval ve filmových X-Men a Hulkovi (protože jsem je překládal).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hunt: Showdown and Crysis developers Crytek are dismissing an estimated 15 percent of their workforce - around 60 people out of 400 – in the face of “the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years”. This comes after they paused development of mechsuit FPS sequel Crysis 4 last year, with staff shifting over to Showdown’s live service reboot Hunt: Showdown 1896. Crytek now say they need to cut back in order to remain “financially sustainable”.

Remedy's exceptionally good horror game Alan Wake 2 is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.
As of September last year, the musical-with-guns had "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. "October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2," says the report.

They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as "completely abrupt and impersonal". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO "fake", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.
Kotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.
That petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.

The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw "Lala Barina" out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki's subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.

Also, the urge to browse the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods, to see what players of the RPG were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

He Is Coming, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike RPG. You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.
Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheery mom-and-pop computer game business Valve have created a new Steamworks page for their policy about in-game adverts and advertising in general, with a troubleshooter's list of dos and don'ts for developers.
As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve's handling of such things hasn't really changed over the past few years, but I can't pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can't bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game's advanced access period.

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

Some trivia from a person who's been in a relationship for decades: Valentine's Day comes less than a month after "Blue Monday", the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week's new PC games likely won't help, assuming you aren't especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well. Let's commence feeding the Maw and hope that we strike a few sparks of amore from the creature's heaving flanks.

I read the examples of Kulkarni's work that Kieron linked, and then the Kulkarni articles the man himself linked, and several hours and several layers deep, I thought: oh no, Neil Kulkarni was one of my guys.

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that Grand Theft Auto 6 is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

But here’s the thing: it's basically just an expensive RTX 4080 Super in disguise (in my opinion). Performance is near-identical, stock is non-existent, and unless you’re willing to shell out over $2,500 for a prebuilt system, good luck getting one.

It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

Finally, I thought, I would have time for some of the recent blockbusters I'd not yet played: Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and more would fill those dusty days and nights in the taint of 2024.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water. "I don't know if that means I should recommend Mark Ffrench's games Proverbs and Mega Mosaic to you, or warn you to steer clear and avoid flowing away forever," responded commenter SeekerX.

You see where this is going. Friends, I played Proverbs for 36 hours over Christmas.

In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

As noticed by third-party tracking platform SteamDB, Valve have begun adding warnings to early access info boxes, making it harder to accidentally spend your pocket money on a promising project that hasn't advanced in years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hark, or whatever that is in Czech. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have "overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem." We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as "Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.

"Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch out for that falling breezeblock! It's about to-- ah, too late, you've been donked. A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several hours of battles, sieges, imprisonment and torture in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, a groggy Henry of Skalitz is woken by a servant girl in a castle outside Kuttenberg. She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.
