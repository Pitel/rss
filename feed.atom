        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTTK Challenge 5 SBC is here in EA FC 25, and here's a great chance to earn one more free pack. 


The fodder challenges are perfect way to improve your squad without spending any coins. These SBCs are easy to complete, and you should have the required fodder already available in your club. Let's take a look at how to complete the last release, and what rewards you'll get after finishing the tasks.


EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 5 SBC tasks


The RTTK Challenge 5 SBC only has one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - RTTK Challenge 5 SBC



Max. 3 Players from the same League


Min. Nationalities in Squad: 5


Min. 3 Players: Gold


Min. 5 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 70


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 23



EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 5 SBC solutions


The focus is to use cards that are already available in your club. That way, you can save your coins, and increase the valuation of your rewards. 



Mazzocchi ST 69


Desogus ST 62


Blin CM 72


White CDM 61


Whiteman CM 74


Berkoe LB 55


Ampadu CB 75


Rouault CB 75


Dixon CB 53


Koita 75


Lynch GK 64



You'll have to spend fodder worth about 3,000 coins to complete the challenge. In return, you'll earn a tradeable Prime Mixed Players Pack. The pack has 12 player items (4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold), and six of those cards will be rare. While rewards could be better, it's never a bad thing to get a pack for practically free of cost. If you're lucky enough to pack something nice, you can also sell the card in the market to make a lot of coins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete a pretty beginner-friendly challenge in Ultimate Team. 


Shortly after his elder brother Marcus received a SBC, Khepren has received a promo card of his own. To get the item, you'll have to complete both tasks of the new SBC. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the card, and if you should invest your resources at all. 


EA FC 25 Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC tasks


Here are the requirements of the Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC, which has two tasks. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - France



Min. 1 Players from: France


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Catarina Macario 84

Hasegawa 84


En-Nesyri 83


Palacios 84

Task 2 - France

Alex Remiro 84


Oberdorf 86


Little 86


De Ligt 84


Buchanan 84


Guirassy 84

For 50,000 coins, the 85-rated card might look slightly expensive. However, he's basically guaranteed two upgrades at least. For 50,000 coins, you're getting a 87-rated mid with a new role++ in the future. He also has some amazing playstyles like Driven Pinged Pass, Intercept, and Relentless. This SBC could become a great bargain after one month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Halloween just around the corner, it’s natural to want to get into the spooky spirit. Reading scary books is a staple of the fall season, and I’m not just talking about ghosts, ghouls and vampires.


When I think of scary books, I don’t immediately get bogged down in the supernatural, but instead I think of stories which have a possibility of coming true, however remote. The potential of people to do awful things is far scarier than ghosts in the attic, because it’s something that any of us could, if things went horribly wrong, live through. 


Of course there are some entries on this list which focus more on the stereotypical spooky factor, but you might be surprised by some of the books included.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still remember the first time I read A Court of Thorns and Roses years ago after a friend recommended the series to me. I was expecting it to be identical to other generic romantic novels I'd read in the past, so I took my time getting through the first book.


A few days later, I'd caught up and read the first four novels before buying the fifth when it came out. I've also since read Sarah J. Maas' two other series and plan on keeping up with any new releases. Let's say I've become a fan of Maas' work over time.


Since being introduced to ACOTAR, I've been curious about how other series compare to it and what unique twists they introduce to stand out among the crowd. Let's check out some of the best books that are reminiscent — or very similar to — A Court of Thorns and Roses that you …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second season of Oshi no Ko comes to a close as the Fall 2024 anime season lineup slowly rolls in. However, the excitement that Season 2 brings isn't over just yet. After the season finale aired, the anime's official website announced the production of Oshi no Ko Season 3.


The announcement also came with a promotional video showcasing some of the second season's notable moments.




Still, there's a bit more. The anime's official X account also released an eye-catching visual to hype the upcoming season.




Furthermore, Anime News Network reports that veteran singer and voice actor Mamoru Miyano will be joining the cast as Hikaru Kamiki, while veteran voice actress Hina Kino will be voicing the enigmatic Tsukuyomi. However, Season 3's official release date is yet to be revealed.


Oshi no Ko Season 2 started airing on July 3, with the final episode airing on October 3. The season focused on the 2.5D theatrical adaptation of the famous Tokyo Blade manga. While it expounded on Aqua, Akane, and Kana's character dynamics, the latter episodes developed the narrative in terms of Aqua's search for revenge and Ruby's realization of her beloved doctor's tragic fate.


The anime is an adaptation of the popular manga series written by Aka Akasaka and illustrated by Mengo Yokoyari. It won the Anime Series of the Year at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival 2024. Both the anime's first and second seasons can be streamed on Netflix, while the manga can be read via MANGA Plus.

Season 1 often left me guessing to the point where I just couldn't flat-out anticipate what would come next. And by the time I reached its finale, I was left wondering, "What's next for our boys in the big blue?"


Season 2's first episode captures that same essence of unpredictability in an entirely unique way, blending new and familiar faces alike. You'll know exactly who the key players are by the look 'em. Just spot the ones with vibrant hair colors or an updo that would make Goku proud, and you've got your main cast. Even though the name of the game remains the same, Blue Lock Season 2 Episode 1 kicks off with a bang, leading the way for a thrilling new arc.

When The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was initially revealed, there was a fair bit of speculation about the new overworld and how it possibly linked up with the map in previous entries. Now, just a week after the latest entry's release, this has seemingly been confirmed.
As highlighted on social media and elsewhere online by Zelda enthusiasts, it appears the new adventure does actually have some connections to the Super Nintendo classic A Link to the Past. This doesn't look to be a coincidence either, with many landmarks visibly lining up with the older game's map.

Since arriving on the Switch and other platforms in August, the turn-based action title SteamWorld Heist II has received ongoing support from the development team, and the latest update (Version 1.5) is now live.
"The headliner" according to the team, is that you can now "buy back rare items" you've sold from the new 'Used Goods' section at 'Argent's Articles'. There are also some new options to improve the 'ship firing angle' and adjust the text speed.

These picks were based on each character's design, personality as well as their usefulness in combat. Nigel was also apparently on the list (between Benrengaria and Virginia) but according to the source "he's not technically part of the ranking".

It also marks the launch of the Barclays WSL objective, which includes two promo cards from England's premier competition in women's football. To play with the new Salmon card, you'll have to complete all the tasks of the challenge. 


EA FC 25 Ebony Salmon Squad Foundations SBC tasks


The Ebony Salmon Squad Foundations SBC has two different tasks, and here are the conditions. 


Task 1 - England



Min. 1 Players from: England


Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 2 - 84-Rated Squad

Usually, I am not a fan of these 85-rated Squad Foundations items, even if they're really low-cost, budget-friendly options. This card is an exception, as she has the Quick Step+ playstyle. In the current meta of R2-speed boost, Quick Step on a striker can be immense. This item can be an excellent super-sub to come off the bench in crucial moments, and you could also use her in a possible future evolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTTK Challenge SBC 4 is a new fodder challenge for you to complete in EA FC 25, and it comes amidst the second week of the Road to the Knockouts. 


EA Sports has been releasing plenty of these simple fodder challenges, which are easy to complete. You should have enough fodder to complete the SBC for free. It won't cost much if you have to buy some/all the fodder from the market. Let's take a look at how to complete the SBC and what are the rewards waiting for you. 


EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge SBC 4 tasks


The RTTK Challenge SBC 4 has only one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - RTTK Challenge 4



Min. 3 Players from the same Club


Min. 4 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 70


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 12



EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge SBC 4 solutions


The main focus is to use the cards that you've in your club to complete the challenge. Here's a solution you can use to finish the SBC for cheap. 



Mateus Quaresma 71


Morris ST 74


Andersen RW 70


Brown 69


Franklin CM 68


Torres CDM 71


Marta Carrasco 70


Ballisager CB 71


Morante CB 63


Oum Gouet 64


Shea GK 67



The cost of completing the SBC is approximately 2,500 coins (if you buy all the cards from the market). Using cards from your own collection will bring the price down. You'll earn a Tradeable Small Prime Electrum Players Pack after completing the challenge. 


The previous RTTK challenges have offered better rewards, but this one has the easiest conditions. The value of the pack is still higher than the cost of the fodder, and hence, you should complete the 4th SBC of the series as well.

The Xe2 graphics performance under Linux was disappointingly slow with it performing even worse than Meteor Lake while RDNA3.5 graphics led. Intel has been investigating the Xe2 Linux graphics performance but I haven't heard any updates yet. Today the attention is on the Lunar Lake CPU side under Linux and it too isn't looking too good. The performance of this 8-core Core Ultra 7 256V SoC is poor in real-world multi-threaded scenarios and the performance-per-Watt is only compelling in a subset of workloads. The AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Zen 5 SoCs tended to deliver the superior performance and power efficiency under Linux.]]></summary>

Posted by user St. Eam the 3rd (thanks, Metro), the Switch categorically has more higher rated games according to Metacritic than the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As members of RPS’s "nutritious", "life altering" and "it cured my oddly-shaped bottom!" supporters program (not actual reviews) will get to read about this Friday, I’ve recently done a 180 in my opinions of scrappy ‘nid stomper Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Navigating "a series of immersive retro analog interfaces", you will complete "tactile, minimalist puzzles" so as to combine eldritch snapshots and reveal new scenes. You know the kind of thing: that isn't a freshly-baked muffin cooling on a second floor window ledge, it's the Slender Man. That isn't a dressing gown, it's your great-uncle Percival, back from the beyond to haunt you for undercooking the fish during the great salmonella outbreak of Xmas 1993.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter.

But I was not prepared for just how absurd and unhinged the hit 2024 game looks as a Wolfenstein-style first-person shooter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China.

It's sitting just behind Black Myth: Wukong at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on Banana's level, mind.

But I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.
As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

The court's decision suggests that IP addresses may not be considered "links", potentially limiting the scope of these subpoenas. This interpretation could impact the music and film industries' efforts to identify and take action against infringers and operators of piracy services.

It's slated to launch in 2026. Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism. It doesn't look like it's going for goofy, but instead opting for largely gritty and serious and almost entirely unrelated to the Yakuza games. Still, though, I do know how the show ends. It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-running chief of the Tekken series, Katsuhiro Harada, once tried to convince KFC to let him use Colonel Sanders as a character in the fighting game, according to an interview with TheGamer. "[They] weren't very open to the idea," added game designer Michael Murray, who sat in on the interview. "[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."
Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into Tekken 8.

A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the trailer for steampunk RPG New Arc Line released in April, I was immediately taken in by its premise. To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’m all for building dread through a lingering introduction, it’s always a treat to play a horror game that wastes no time tearing the moorings of familiarity right out from underneath you, as is the case with 13th Street Studios’ Becrowned. In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the Tokyo Game Show? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new Death Stranding 2 scenes then. Watch them on your phone for added kino.

Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mojang want to release smaller updates more frequently for Minecraft, instead of one major update each summer. This evening's Minecraft Live stream detailed the Bravery And Bundles update, coming next, but also another update to follow in the next few months. A creepy update.

It doesn't have a name yet, but it'll add The Pale Garden, a new biome of eerie, grey trees and hanging moss that's quiet during the day, but which at night is inhabited by a new mob, the Creaking.

Tellingly, this only came to the forefront after a 17-year-old developer put together an unofficial transparency portal.

There's a fine tradition of clown characters in RPGs - Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI, Harle from Chrono Cross, the Jester in Darkest Dungeon - but a whole party's worth? The full big top? The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for Clowned King, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious Keylocker. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known for years that consoles have simply become preboxed PCs, and now look: we’re getting into their controllers as well. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

I'm thankful for this, because if the witch did not have a nice hop, the game would be maddening in a bad way. Don't get me wrong, it's still maddening. Just in a good way. The hop is good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. 


Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experimental, feature-length simulation game Apartment Story is not especially brilliant, but it does feature a home invasion that’s stressful in several, systemically tangible ways I’ve never quite felt in such a specific combination from a videogame before. It’s partly a story about mental health, partly about the absolute horror of not just managing a Sim but actually being one, and partly about seeing how many wanks and cheese sandwiches you can fit into a single morning. Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might remember Kara Stone as the developer of Ritual Of The Moon, a game about a banished witch that is played in bursts of five minutes a day, over the course of a lunar cycle. Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wartorn sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter has had a messy launch into early access. For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

It’s called Threads Of Time, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful.

I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

If you aren't, let me explain: Zachtronics are or were a US-based video game developer founded in 2000 by Zach Barth, who put the studio on ice in 2022 and now works at Coincidence Games, a "flexible business framework" involving many former Zachtronics devs. Zachtronics have thrown together all kinds of things - Infiniminer, a block-builder from 2009, is probably the single greatest individual influence on Minecraft, while Eliza is a tremendous visual novel about AI chatbots and labour politics. But if there's a type of game they're known for, it's engineering puzzles and factory games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, remember Lost In Random? I reviewed it way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced The Midnight Walk at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person adventure where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe.

Open world samurai action game Ghost Of Tsushima is getting a follow-up called Ghost Of Yotei, developers Sucker Punch have announced (or Ghost Of Yōtei, to include the technically-correct-but-annoying-to-reproduce-on-UK-keyboards diacritic that I will hereby drop to secure our sanity). It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.

And Edwin noted that the other would probably be a crossover with Remedy's other big game, Control, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. 
The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful "altered items" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Crimson Desert dropped that audacious trailer at Gamescom 2023, I’ve yearned to soak in its medieval Just Cause 2 vibes. It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

What’s the equivalent of poison? What are experience points and checkpoints called, although you’re going to call them souls and bonfires anyway? I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Velmi příjemné překvapení. Dobře napsané i zahrané scény mezi lidmi, kterým poněkud nefunguje komunikace a navzájem si připadají "trochu divní". Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
