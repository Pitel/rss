        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google began to delist pirate sites from local search results last year. The search engine voluntarily complies with court orders targeted at third-party Internet providers. This is also true in the UK, where The Pirate Bay initially remained unblocked. A recent wave of removal requests corrected this initial oversight and hundreds of Pirate Bay domains have since been removed.

Recycling has been a pretty big thing for a while now, and for good reason. Chucking a load of plastic away is, of course, terrible for the environment, so why not break it down and use it for something else? One talented artist has done just that, taking a whole bunch of random bits of garbage and remaking it into something truly beautiful - a miniature diorama of Super Mario Odyssey.
Posted by Studson Studio on YouTube, the progress video shows how he went about creating the miniature diorama, from combining bits of plastic junk to form the foundation of the Odyssey ship to creating a base of dirt from, er... dirt. It's a fascinating process and we recommend you watch the whole video to truly appreciate the work that's gone into this thing. We appreciate all types of art, of course, but when it also goes toward helping the environment, heck yeah - we love it.

Epic Games Store users can bag themselves an absolute gem of a title for free, as Dotemu's Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is offered up to all EGS customers gratis this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYXzXBbFKOY
Developed by Lizardcube and released in 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is a remake done right. Based upon the excellent 1989 Sega Master System RPG, Lizardcube's title recreates the cart-based classic in a 1:1 capacity, switching out the 8-bit visuals for stylish and attractive hand-drawn visuals. In addition, the remake features a charming, rerecorded score, and includes new features such as additional difficulty options and a new playable hero, Wonder Girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMah9liwPyY
In addition to the Wonder Boy remake, Epic Games Store will also be giving away  Baeloth's Gladiator of the Dark Pits expansion pack, for use with Dungeons & Dragons adventure title Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm. Players need only log in to the D&D title from July 14 to automatically unlock access to the DLC expansion.
The new titles will be made available for all to download from July 14-21. Next week, from July 21-28, players can claim the shopkeeping sim Shop Titans and the 64-player WWI FPS Tannenberg.
If you do not have it already, be sure to pick up The Dragon's Trap. Without hyperbole, it is one of the most enjoyable, enduring, and compelling remakes ever made.

The trailer looks proof-of-concept-y, as is often the way, but I like the concept.
And looking over the screenshots — a tomato being slowly sliced, a filet sizzling on the stovetop, a splash of water hitting a glass of ice cubes— I can just "hear" these images. Depending on the person, "ASMR sounds" can be soothing or offputting, and I tend to fall in the former group more often than the latt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because sure, why not
Wordle has seen huge success, as it went from cute and engaging daily game to overnight craze. It's now owned by the New York Times, and the Times is partnering with Hasbro now to make a Wordle board game.
CNN reports that the New York Times and Hasbro are collaborating on Wordle: The Party Game, a board game adaptation of the online version.
In the board game version, players compete with each other to guess words the other players have scribbled. Rather than guessing the word solo against the computer, you're trying to guess the other team's chosen five-letter word. It's kind of like Mastermind or Battleship, but with words.

There are a few different game types out of the box, including a "fast mode" that involves a clock and team variations. I also dig the dry-erase boards and markers, so it's easy to just re-use the same board over and over again.
Wordle: The Party Game is currently live for pre-order on Amazon, the Hasbro site, and soon on Target. The board game goes for $19.99 and will ship on October 1, 2022.
Guess the secret phrase
While strange, it isn't all too surprising. Board games are increasingly popular as of late, and board game adaptations are no different. Look at how many video games have been turned into tabletop versions over the years.
With the popularity of Wordle, I imagine a Worlde board game will absolutely sell like hotcakes. And now I'm just curious if other popular online games are soon to be adapted, too. How much longer until newfound Heardle owner Spotify turns the audio game into a board game?

The multiplayer wrestling battle royale Rumbleverse is launching quite soon. Iron Galaxy announced today that Rumbleverse will launch on August 11 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC via Epic.
The free-to-play brawler goes live on the 11th, and a week later the first season of Rumbleverse will kick off. According to Iron Galaxy's blog, this will include a Battle Pass with cosmetics to earn along a special path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOmxeeyRsI
Rumbleverse is a 40-player battle royale-style game. But rather than guns and shooting, Rumbleverse is about good ol' fashioned wrestling. Characters can pick up and use various moves like strikes, kicks, uppercuts, and giant slams to knock out opponents.
Announced in December during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse was set to launch in February. Iron Galaxy delayed the launch though, and has been running tests and early playtimes. Now, it seems like the fighter's ready to head into the ring.
Bah gawd
It's been hard to miss Rumbleverse, as it's been making the rounds in the fighting game community social sphere with each new playtest. And I'll admit, the concept has me intrigued. Plenty of battle royale games hone in on accuracy and shooting ability, but very few have sated the brawling, fighting, wrasslin' urge.
There have been several battle royales that have gone into and out of the spotlight over the years, but this one at least seems worth a test drive. At the low, low price of free, why not?
Rumbleverse slams onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via the Epic Games Store on August 11.

Odds are if you're talking to someone who loves storytelling in video games, there's lore from at least one game that they can recite by heart. Especially when it comes to games that really focus on the gameplay first, like League of Legends or Bloodborne, lore is a great, indirect way to get players engaged in the story of your world if there isn't much time in the game itself to tell that story.
It can be a case of "come for the game, stay for the story," or sometimes players get into a game because they learned about all the lore first, but either way, loving a game for the world it creates for us is a beautiful thing. But I have to be honest. For someone who loves story in games like, a lot, I just can't bring myself to get into…]]></summary>

I don't know much about wine, but I sure like to pretend I do, and I bet I'm not alone. Who else here — of drinking age, that is — has bought a red wine to accompany dinner, because it "goes well with pasta"? How many times have you been poured a glass of wine to "taste" in a fancy restaurant, going through the whole rigmarole of smacking your lips together and saying "oh yes, lovely" even though it just tastes like wine? And, be honest now, do you do that thing where you try a new wine and then try to guess the random assortment of fruits on the label to show off in front of your friends? "Oh, yes, plum, see, I did mention stone fruits, didn't I, Janice?" Yeah, we're all the same, and we all have no idea what we're talking about.
But here's something I do know about: Video games. I've been doing this job for a while now, and I've played quite a few of them. I am no sommelier of digital media, mind you, but I'm definitely knowledgeable enough to be able to recommend you a hearty, robust RPG or a nice indie palate-cleanser, depending on your taste. But I would like to propose a change to the way we talk about games, at the risk that it's going to make me sound like the kind of person that won't shut up about wine.

Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games have proudly announced that super-fun beat-'em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge smashed its release sales expectations, having sold a mighty one million copies during its first seven days of release. Radical.
"Tribute Games set out to make the ultimate celebration of a chapter in TMNT history that means the world to us, and it’s been wonderful to watch the accessible fun of beat-em-ups resonate with longtime fans and genre newcomers alike," said Tribute Games Co-Founder Jean-Francois Major in a press release. "We’re thankful for all of the support and encouragement the passionate TMNT community has shown us since the reveal of TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, and we look forward to watching players continue to discover the easter eggs we’ve hidden throughout the game while chaining together some bodacious combos."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozKsDzumb0c
Kicking off on PC and consoles on July 16, Shredder's Revenge is a passionate recall of the classic Konami TMNT arcades of yesterday. Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, and Raphael take to the streets of New York once again to see off the evil Foot Clan, as well as a host of iconic villains from the classic 1987 animated series. Joined on the journey by pals Splinter, April O'Neil, and an unlockable Casey Jones, our heroes in a half-shell battle it out in colorful and chaotic arcade action. It's good old-fashioned fun for one-to-four players, and a must-buy for any fan of the enduring TMNT franchise.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It is also available via Xbox Game Pass. You can check out our review of the bodacious brawler right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's going to be 'intense'
Another Aliens video game is in development, this time at Survios, the VR-centric studio behind games like Raw Data, Creed: Rise to Glory, and The Walking Dead Onslaught.
The studio hasn't announced the name yet, but says the game will fall into the single-player, action-horror camp, which is something I can vaguely latch onto. Vaguely. It's another "original storyline, set between the Alien and Aliens ﬁlms," in which a "battle-hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs." Alien Islolation 2 this is not.
Built in Unreal Engine 5 for PC, consoles, and VR platforms, the Aliens game "will take full advantage of Survios’ expertise in creating immersive and authentic gaming experiences."
More details at SDCC
With only some Xenomorph artwork to go on for now, we'll have to wait until San Diego Comic-Con to learn more. Survios will share more details during the Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe panel at SDCC next Thursday, July 21 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific.
"The vast universe of Alien is full of untold stories, and opportunities to create gripping original games," said Luigi Priore, vice president, Disney, Pixar, and 20th Century Games. "We're thrilled to work with a team like Survios who shares our passion for Alien."
The studio is very much staffing up, hence this early, detail-light game announcement.
For all of the effort so far, I feel like the Aliens series hasn't been able to capture lightning in a bottle lately, and I'm not convinced that'll change anytime soon. Another upcoming game, Aliens: Dark Descent from Tindalos Interactive, is a squad-commanding real-time action game. Could be good! Or it could be another one that pads out the list.
At least with VR in the picture, we might get some adrenaline-pumping moments.

Redout 2 is already out on PC and all the various Xboxes and PlayStations, and includes a single-player career mode and competitive multiplayer, with up to 12 people to race against across 36 tracks. You can customise your own hovership with 12 chassis choices, flaps, wings, spoilers, rocket engines, and more, and then do a classy car photoshoot with the game's Photo Mode. There's also a bangin' soundtrack that features electronic artists from Zardonic and Dance with the Dead to the legendary composer Giorgio Moroder.

Spidersaurs is arguably the biggest release hitting the Switch today, as WayForward goes back to its roots yet again with another cartoonishly-presented run and gun platformer.

As is customary with WayForward, Spidersaurs will have an animated intro (this one is styled after Saturday morning cartoons), as well as co-op play. Unlocks, as well as three difficulty settings are in too. Also, XEL is coming to Switch. The well-reviewed Steam game arrived this week, and will be hitting the Switch eShop today.

When Sonic Frontiers was first announced, fans were happy to learn that longtime Sonic the Hedgehog comics writer Ian Flynn joined Sonic Team in writing the game. Flynn has been a prominent writer across both the long-running Archie Comics and IDW Publishing runs of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, with hundreds of credits to his name. However, joining Sonic Team for a mainline entry is new territory.
"Ian has been working as a comic writer for a long time, so I was very familiar with his work, but after reading the IDW comics, I was even more impressed with his talent," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. "That's why I wanted to ask him to work on the story fo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. crossover platform fighter MultiVersus will soon be playable once again, this time to everyone who wants to throw down. The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This game led to another rebirth of Square Enix JRPGs
The fourth Octopath Traveler anniversary is upon us, seeing as the original release was back on July 13, 2018.
Square Enix is celebrating with a tweet, reminding us of the four-year anniversary, and providing a "commemorative illustration" of the crew from a member of producer Tomoya Asano's team: Tatsuaki Urushihara. They also remind folks that Live a Live is coming out later this month. So while we haven't gotten a direct sequel yet in the west (a mobile prequel called Champions of the Continent came out in 2020 in Japan, and is coming soon elsewhere), it's impacted many other projects since its launch, and has shifted Square Enix's priorities as a whole.
Octopath Traveler can be considered a bird of a feather with several other modern pushes for JRPGs within the company. One of the bigger waves involved Bravely Default, which came roaring in during 2012, and reminded people that yes, there is an audience for the genre still. There was another wave in 2016 with I Am Setsuna, which ushered in the creation of Tokyo RPG Factory, and led to Lost Sphear, and Oninaki.
The legacy of Octopath itself (amid this Octopath Traveler anniversary) is directly responsible for the existence of Triangle Strategy, as well as numerous other games in that same style. Square Enix even cited Octopath Traveler's aesthetic choice as an influence and drive to bring Live a Live back in the form of a remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crusaders embark for a new realm
Owlcat Games' Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is making the leap to consoles. The giant RPG will launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both physically and digitally on Sept. 29, as well as Nintendo Switch via cloud.
Wrath of the Righteous will also be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, via backward compatibility. Once the console version launches, the Enhanced Edition of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous will become the standard version, and PC owners will all get that version for free on Sept. 29.
Owlcat has also announced that The Treasure of the Midnight Isles, the third DLC for this Pathfinder, launches on August 11. This new adventure heads to the Midnight Isles, where horrors and terrors abound. There's both a standalone rogue-like mode and campaign option available, allowing players to experiment with builds and party compositions if they'd like. Even if a party dies, its progress can help future playthroughs.

The Treasure of the Midnight Isles will be available either as a separate purchase, or as part of the season pass.
Many stories to tell
Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is, by all accounts, a massive RPG. It's got a somewhat-daunting amount of content, not all too dissimilar from other isometric RPGs. But if you're looking for a console RPG to eat up your time, you could probably do worse. Impressions of the PC version seem mostly positive, and there's even more on the way with the Midnight Isles DLC.
Owlcat, meanwhile, is also forging on to a new franchise. Last month's Warhammer Skulls festival showcase confirmed that Owlcat is creating a Warhammer 40K CRPG, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader.

In news that, quite honestly, was something of an inevitability, Capcom has revealed that its recent Street Fighter 6 demo will be making the rounds at next month's Evolution (EVO) fighting game tournament. Attendees will be able to check out the upcoming fighter live on location at Mandalay Bay.
While trial sessions of Street Fighter 6 have been mostly confined to the press and/or Capcom's best buddies, the publisher is now beginning to drip-feed access to the public at several upcoming events, such as the aforementioned EVO and the incoming San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC). I would not be surprised if, much like with Street Fighter V, we don't also see some form of closed or open beta rolling out as we exit summer and enter the fall season.
https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1547219490508767233?s=20&t=XbidzCD5y6vvVQGjKHRCTQ
While Street Fighter fans were hit with an abundance of info (both officially and very unofficially) last month, Capcom has since gone quiet on the new fighter, with nary a new character announcement, trailer, or update to be seen. We are almost guaranteed to hear some new info at EVO, (perhaps even SDCC), hopefully in the form of a character trailer or two. In the meantime, be sure to check out our previous reports on the leaked character roster, the breakdown of Family Man Guile, and a look at the sequel's intriguing new mechanics.
EVO 2022 will take place at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay resort on the weekend of August 5-7. Tomorrow is the final day to register for the event. Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox in 2023.

Ah, the beautiful game. It's the world's most popular sport, so news that Mario Strikers: Battle League has already overtaken lifetime sales of Mario Golf: Super Rush in Europe less than a month after release may not come as a massive surprise, even if Super Rush has been out for over a year. We're big golf fans here at Nintendo Life — any excuse to wear loud trousers — but of course a football game is going to do better! Being based in the UK, we're legally required to love football more than any other country. Except that's not true, if physical European sales of Mario's latest kickaround are anything to go by.
According to GSD (Games Sales Data) physical sales figures from GameIndustry.Biz's June report, it's not the UK but France who has demonstrated the lion's share of the soccer love on the European continent — at least where Mario is concerned — with 40% of all physical copies sold so far going into the hands of French football (and Switch) fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And it's also just called Skate
Electronic Arts and developer Full Circle hosted the first of a new video series about its upcoming Skate game today. Alongside confirming it's simply called Skate, the team confirms Skate will be a free-to-play live-service game.
The new episode of "The Board Room" goes into detail about the upcoming model for the new Skate. (Not Skate 4, by the way. Skate, period.) It's targeting PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and will be both cross-play and cross-progression.
Skate will also be free to play. The team outlines four rules they have for their monetization: no pay-to-win, no map areas behind a paywall, no paid loot boxes, and no paid gameplay advantages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAMgtFyrQLk
In an interview with The Verge, Skate head of product management Isabelle Mocquard says microtransactions in the game are "primarily" going to be for cosmetics and convenience.
"I want it to be very clear that it’s not a pay-to-win game," Mocquard tells The Verge. "There won’t be any gameplay areas hidden exclusively behind a paywall. Players won’t be able to buy any gameplay altering advantages."
The Skate team is planning on things like seasonal drops and live events, though it is still exploring options. Mobile is also an option the team is currently investigating.
Skate collaboration
Another feature the team talks about in this new update is CollaboZones. These let players collaboratively build areas that appear in other players' worlds. It's got a lot of potential for chaos, that's for sure. Giant ramps, slides, and sheer chaos seems like it fits the Skate bill.
No release date has been set yet. The team is extending out invites for the Skate playtest though, to get more players into the early look at this new skateboarding game. Just make sure you're opting in through proper channels, and not any sketchy websites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taking the Zelda formula into space.
Zelda games have laid out a comfortable roadmap for developers to follow when making action-adventure games, and there's no shortage of Zelda-likes to enjoy on Switch and elsewhere. Tiny Roar evidently took heavy notes from Nintendo’s storied franchise when putting together XEL, which takes cues from both classic and modern Zelda titles and places them in a beautiful sci-fi setting that, at first glance, is perfect for exploring. Unfortunately, there are some serious technical issues with the visuals on Switch that hold it back from reaching its full potential.
XEL follows the story of Reid, a wise-cracking spaceship pilot who crash-lands in a strange environment with no memory of her past or even her name. She is quickly joined by Chap, a silent robot floating companion who encourages her to look around this strange new land. The world is bright and colourful, giving a beautiful glimpse into a world of advanced technology that has been reclaimed by nature.

Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that’s more than meets the eye.

Brand loyalty is getting more rewarding. Sony has revealed it's launching a new loyalty program called PlayStation Stars, rewarding players for playing games and completing various activities.
In a new PlayStation blog, Sony VP of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise Grace Chen describes what's in store for the program. While it doesn't have an exact launch date just yet, the plan is for PlayStation Stars to reward players for doing things in their games.
One example is completing a campaign by winning a tournament. Another might require earning a specific trophy, or being the first person to Platinum a game in your time zone. Others might just be check-in campaigns, only asking you to play the game.

The latest Japanese charts are in and it's another strong week for Capcom's Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak Set, with the pack leading the charge again with an impressive 44,071 units sold. Although this is a sharp drop from the 104,315 units sold during its launch week, this is still a solid figure for the latest entry to the Monster Hunter franchise.
Elsewhere, there's not a lot to highlight here. The only new addition is KLONOA Phantasy Reverie Series, which lands at the half way point at number five. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has dropped a few spots to come in at number eight, and Mario Strikers: Battle League has predictably fallen out of the top ten altogether.

        <updated>2022-07-14T16:00:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Naive Angel Mode"
Following Nintendo's release date announcement, Platinum had a tweet of their own to showcase a Bayonetta 3 optional mode: a toggle, actually.
It's called "Naïve Angel mode, and here's what the developer had to say about it:
"Relax, the witch is back and sexier than ever. We've added the revolutionary 'Naive Angel Mode' to Bayonetta 3 so more people can fully enjoy it. By turning it on, you can play right in the living room without having to worry about what's on screen... we think."

The tweet goes a step further and actually shows the mode in action with a 40-second video. It slides back and forth and shows what a scene might look like with the toggle on or off. For the most part, as is customary, this seems like it'll be heavily used during "finishers," when Bayonetta utilizes various transformation forms to cut down bosses — but it can also apply costume changes. If you're curious, you can watch it below!
This is such a loaded issue, but having it as an optional toggle should (ha!) satisfy as many people as possible. People who don't like the Bayonetta 3 optional mode can completely ignore it, and relish the fact that Nintendo is still releasing M-rated games (as has been the case for a while) on the system. The phrase "relax, the witch is back and sexier than ever" implies that Bayonetta 3 will not be a compromise per se.
While talks with platform holders as to what remains "acceptable" rage on (mainly with Sony), these sorts of clever solutions could allow studios to have it both ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.
Survios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens "where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs."
There’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.
This project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.]]></summary>

A Bayonetta Switch physical edition is coming "later this year," according to Nintendo, who will be providing more info at a later date.
The news was revealed with the Bayonetta 3 launch date trailer this week, but Nintendo has separately clarified a bit on how that distribution of the first game will go down.
Since collectors will be itching for any kernel of info, here is everything we have on the Bayonetta Switch physical edition, straight from Nintendo
It's priced at $30, MSRP
It'll be a standalone physical release on September 30, 2022
"A limited number of the Bayonetta physical version will be available to pre-order via select retailers and available at launch in the My Nintendo Store"
The Masquerade Edition of Bayonetta 3 will contain three game sleeves, one for Bayonetta 1
Hopefully the rollout will be smooth, and will provide plentiful options/stock, with safeguards in place for bots/scalpers. That will totally happen you all.
But really folks! Ideally, none of these retailer drops will be "two-minute sellouts at 2AM Eastern time," or riddled with hours-long login queues. This isn't a special edition, it's a $30 re-release.
That said, there is a special edition in the works for Bayonetta 3: the aforementioned Masquerade Edition. You can get a look at it here:

Growing up in the ‘90s in rural Canada meant that I saw the decline of the arcade early. However, I’ve always had an overwhelming fondness for them. My mind is so focused on video games, that I can still point out the bowling alleys that had a Metal Slug cabinet. I recall the time that one place had Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter. What a win! When I went to Japan, I stopped in every tobacco-scented game center I crossed paths with.
I recently changed my life by getting a decent arcade stick. It’s very difficult to find any cabinets these days (I wonder if the Galaxy Theatre still has Virtual On), but the feeling of slamming my fingers across a cluster of big ol’ buttons eases my longing.
But a good arcade stick is nothing without games to play using it.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insert coin.
Since there’s little 'wrong' with Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium, what’s right with it will depend on the sensibilities and interests of the player. The second of Capcom’s superbly curated compilations following on from Capcom Arcade Stadium, its 32 arcade titles (one of which is free) now feature a greater emphasis on action and fighting games. As before, you can buy the complete bundle pack or download the frontend and purchase titles individually.
Everything runs silky smooth, lag-free, and is presented as a scrollable strip of tantalisingly jumbled-up arcade cabinets. The interface is attractive and highly customisable, with difficulty adjustments, auto-fire options, abundant wallpaper bezels, and the ability to order games by genre. Like the previous release, you can refashion your arcade by individually changing the look of each cabinet. The external view option, too, is intriguing, drawing out to reveal the mock machine’s housing. It’s not the most efficient way to play, nor does it work well on anything except a large TV screen, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless.

That's because we're talking about our favourite towers in games. This means we need to draw a distinction between towers (the gamified concept as most popularly complained about in Ubisoft games) and towers (the architectural thing). Luckily, games have a lot of both.
Meanwhile, Nate's fish issue (fisssue?) is growing worse, I am enjoying the local acts performing on the summer bandstand, and we talk about Lord Of The Rings and Lord Of The Rings related things. What fantasy creature would you like to conjure into real-life existence? We both said orc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. 
According to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. 
You can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.
Loyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles." Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. 
These collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  
“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.
PlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

The 'My Nintendo Store' is currently under maintenance for several countries in the EU and will reportedly be down for "a few weeks", meaning it is currently not possible for users to browse or make purchases on the store (thanks to user NielsNL for the tip).
We've tested this out, and the store is down in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands among other EU countries. The reasoning behind this is unclear at this time; perhaps the stores are being updated to be more aligned with the UK version. Either way, we've reached out to Nintendo to get some clarification on the matter.

According to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: 
"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year."

As the Demon Slayer show gears up for the next arc later this year, we're headed to the Entertainment District this week, as more Demon Slayer DLC is getting released today.
It's none other than Tengen Uzui, the sound Hashira (they're kind of like masters/leaders); one of the flashy leads of the aforementioned Entertainment arc. Alongside Tengen, everyone can download a new arena/stage (Entertainment District) for free, which is playable in versus mode. Tengen is also playable in versus, and comes with "a set of profile photos and quotes."
Here's the Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles DLC schedule (which Sega says is "five separate releases"):
Tengen Uzui
Nezuko Kamado (Advanced Demon Form)
Tanjiro Kamado (Entertainment District)
Zenitsu Agatsuma (Entertainment District)
Inosuke Hashibira (Entertainment District)
Daki
Gyutaro
If you're curious, the character [season] pass is $24.99. Sega stresses that all platforms will be able to partake, including PC and Switch. And speaking of Switch-related stuff: the Kimetsu Academy Summer Uniforms, a Switch exclusive, are arriving on every platform today for $4.99. Here's what that entails, outfit-wise:
Kimetsu Academy Tanjiro Kamado,
Kimetsu Academy Nezuko Kamado,
Kimetsu Academy Zenitsu Agatsuma,
Kimetsu Academy Inosuke Hashibira
Kimetsu Academy Giyu Tomioka.
This is neither here nor there, but I can't tell you how many times I wrote "Bandai Namco" for any story having to do with this game: it's still crazy to me that they aren't publishing their 1000th anime action brawler!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wii Make Movies
Nintendo has announced that it is currently in negotiations to acquire Dynamo Pictures, a visual content company located in Tokyo, Japan. Once the deal completes later this year, the CG-heavy studio is expected to be re-monikered Nintendo Pictures, and will produce content for Nintendo going forward.
Nintendo has not specified exactly what role Nintendo Pictures will play in the future. Speaking in its public statement of intent, the legendary publisher succinctly states: "Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group."
While it might be easy to jump to the conclusion that this acquisition will see Nintendo dive into the overcrowded market of TV and movie production, it should also be noted that the new subsidiary could simply be directed to produce trailers, showcases, montages, and CGI sequences for Nintendo's various video game releases and live streaming events. Dynamo has previously worked with Nintendo on a series of cute Pikmin shorts, and has also produced CG content for a variety of video game and anime releases, including Death Stranding, Ghost in the Shell, NieR Replicant, Persona 5, and Monster Hunter World.
You can check out Nintendo's public statement of intent right here. Nintendo intends to purchase all remaining shares of Dynamo Pictures by October 3, whereby it will become owned and operated directly by the video game giant.

Oh, hello. You like retro action-platformers and roguelites, eh? You must be, since you clicked on the title. Unless you clicked it to complain about action-platformers. Or Dead Cells. Or video games in general.
But let's pretend it's just us fans of action, platformers, and roguelites in here. There's a new game on the block called Bravery & Greed that looks rather intriguing:

Nintendo hasn't had the best track record when it comes to making music readily available to the masses, with the publisher issuing strikes against multiple YouTube users for using (or even just covering) its music online. This latest piece of news, however, signals more than ever that it to make some huge strides in distributing its various soundtracks far better than it's been doing so far.
As reported by VGC, it's been claimed that bootleg copies of soundtracks from games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie are being sold online for up to hundreds of dollars to users in the UK and Japan. This comes from a collector of Rare merchandise called CaptainBreegull on Twitter, who bought a copy of the Banjo-Kazooie soundtrack from a user on eBay for $30 to verify its authenticity. Turns out the CD is entirely fake, with key differences in the cover art and CD itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running off like that was reckless AND stupid
It was always inevitable that Capcom's Resident Evil 2 remake was going to do gangbusters numbers — after all, the studio was revisiting one of their most closely-held, beloved, and nostalgic releases. But it seems that the pull of the Raccoon City Police Department knows no bounds, with the recent news that the critically acclaimed revisit has surpassed a staggering 10 million total sales.
Released in 2019, a little over 20 years on from the groundbreaking PlayStation classic, Resident Evil 2 is a retelling of the worst "first day on the job" ever. Heroes Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield roll into Raccoon City to find that the entire town has been besieged by terrifying biokinetic monsters. Holding fort in the most bizarrely designed police station in modern memory, the new friends attempt to survive the night, holding off a menagerie of beasties while uncovering the truth about the living nightmare now engulfing the burned-out 'berg.
Capcom's revelation of the remake's ongoing success is timely, arriving on the same day that streaming service Netflix premieres its live-action adaptation, Resident Evil. The new show sees lead character Jade Wesker (Ella Balinska) attempting to make sense of the increasingly threatening world around her, whilst also coming to terms with the miserable and destructive legacy her bloodline has left behind. While I am yet to check out the show myself, this morning's round of reviews seem quite divisive, but still err on the side of positivity for the most part.
Resident Evil 2 is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

But the initial wave of PS Plus Premium classics was sparse, and so far, the rollout is as incremental as folks had feared.

Sci-fi narrative adventure Citizen Sleeper is getting more content, starting this month. FLUX, the first of three free DLC episodes for Citizen Sleeper, launches on July 28, 2022.
FLUX is one of three upcoming updates, and centers on tensions around a refugee ship bound for Erlin's Eye, the station on which Citizen Sleeper takes place. All three of Citizen Sleeper's new episodes expand on the wider narrative of the Helion System, where the Eye is located.
The FLUX storyline will introduce new characters at the heart of its story. Eshe is the stubborn captain of the Climbing Briar, tangled up with the flotilla. Peake, their second-in-command, will also play a role in a story about getting relief through quarantine.

We all live in our own bubbles, and sometimes, it can be interesting to see how big they really are. Halfway through the year, Twitter has shared a list of the top ten most tweeted video games of 2022 — it's the usual suspects, for sure, but there is at least one surprise.
Poring over 1.5 billion gaming tweets (a 36 percent year-over-year increase), Twitter has confirmed that Genshin Impact — and viral newcomer Wordle — have locked down the #1 and #2 spots, respectively. Curiously, though, Zelda is back on the list — which makes me wonder if anyone has guessed the sequel's name by now. Scream into the void!

As the old saying goes "If you want war, prepare to war with the war," and warfaring games should certainly start preparing, as publisher Sega and developer Relic Entertainment have announced that the new sequel Company of Heroes 3 will be sounding the order to battle on PC on November 17, 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeiqt_E0KjU
This third mainline entry in the Company of Heroes series will offer up four playable factions and two single-player experiences, set against the backdrop of World War battles waged in Italy and North Africa. The Italian Dynamic Campaign will feature dynamic, choice-based, open-ended gameplay, while the North African Operation — spotlit in the new trailer above — will feature a more traditional, narratively driven experience, featuring new mechanics and a wide variety of additional units.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQLmf4HSoKQ
If you fancy diving into the action before the fall, then head on over to the official Company of Heroes website and register for the "CoH-Development" community feedback program. Once signed up, then you will be afforded access to an Alpha build of Company of Heroes 3, complete with a mission from the new North African campaign. Be sure to move fast, as the new North African trial will only be made available until July 19. Further community projects are planned between now and launch day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeiqt_E0KjU
Company of Heroes 3 will launch November 17 on PC (via Steam).

He concluded his review by saying, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge gives me what I wanted: a polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games. Turtles fans new and old will find plenty to love, but those possessing a nostalgia for this era of the franchise are in for the biggest treat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End of an era
The expectations for the recent Heroes of the Storm update were low, especially after the recent announcement, but this is something else.
Here is what Blizzard hit us with this week for the Heroes of the Storm July 12, 2022 update:
General
Hero Rotation will update every 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd of every month.
Each new Season will now have 4 New Seasonal Quests for new Ranked Season.
Collection
Epic Chaos Lizard Mount has been added for Login reward.
Spectral Butcher Skin is now available for purchase.
To be clear, this is the content push that's being done right after announcing that the game is going into maintenance mode beyond the state it was already in following the "Brack Letter." Players get a mount and the opportunity to buy a skin. Oh, and free heroes will continue to rotate. That's...pretty much it. No balances, no reworks (which were said to be in the works last time we spoke with the team), and definitely no new heroes this week.
For many Heroes of the Storm community members (and former developers!), this past week has been a punch in the gut. Most notably, the Into the Nexus podcast — which has been the marquee Heroes podcast since the game launched seven years ago (and with pre-launch episodes, before that) — is saying goodbye to the game this month, and will shift the podcast to a new focus.
It's been a heck of a run. Heroes remained one of my favorite games since it arrived in June of 2015, year after year. I know a handful of people that still play it regularly, and the community is among one of the most passionate pockets of gaming I've witnessed in my entire life. I mean, with the servers still online maybe there's potential down the road for some miracle to happen (especially under the Microsoft banner); but for now, the game is decidedly in a state of cryostasis.

Speaking candidly on mod website GameBanana, however, Xannan did not hold back their frustrations in working with the final release.

When Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay.

Thanks to another Genshin Impact trailer, we're getting more insight into the mysterious Fatui Harbingers, who have been machinating many of the events of the game behind the scenes. We know Childe intimately (as he's a playable character), and we've defeated Signora via a boss fight, but the majority are still a mystery.
We're given a taste of the English voices employed for the previously unseen Fatui cast, as well as some insight into how they interact with the world and each other. There are major story implications for this "interlude," which ends with a quick look at Collei, and an off-screen callout from Tighnari, (who will both be playable).

The hack-and-slash zombie game, Lollipop Chainsaw, might have received lukewarm reviews, but a remake is still on the way. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda took to Twitter today to let avid fans know it'll "be as close as possible to a remaster." You can check out his post below.

July 12, 2022
In his statement, Yasuda spoke about the primary goal of the remake and the incoming changes:
The original Lollipop Chainsaw was released in 2012 and was about high school cheerleader Juliet and her journey to survival amid a zombie apocalypse in California. For those of you that never played the game, you're right to assume that Juliet donned a flesh-shredding chainsaw. Suda51 and James Gunn (The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy) collaborated on the gory, blood-pumping adventure. Joe Juba reviewed Lollipop Chainsaw and concluded his review by saying:

Sega's next mini retro console is also making its way to North America. The Sega Genesis Mini 2 will launch in North America on October 27, Sega confirms.
The Genesis Mini 2 is the follow-up to Sega's Genesis Mini, from 2019. Following in the footsteps of other mini classic consoles, like the NES and SNES Classic or PlayStation Classic, it packed a bunch of Genesis games into a single little console box.
The Genesis Mini 2 will have more power, according to Sega, and a library of 50 classic games previously unreleased on the Genesis Mini. This will also include some Sega CD titles, too.

The console will come with the six-button Control Pad as well. Controllers that released alongside the Sega Genesis Mini will still be compatible, too.
Sega's site has a current list of games for the console, which you can find below.
Sega Genesis Mini 2 games (as of July 13, 2022):
Sonic CD
Shining Force CD
Silpheed
Mansion of Hidden Souls
Night Striker
Ninja Warriors
After Burner II
OutRun
OutRunners
Virtua Racing
Super Hang-On
Sonic 3D Blast
Shining in the Darkness
VectorMan 2
The Ooze
Bonanza Bros.
Alien Soldier
Rainbow Islands -Extra-
Splatterhouse 2
Rolling Thunder 2
Lightening Force
Fantasy Zone
Star Mobile

Full-motion classics
There are a few more games to make their way in to get that count over 50. But with Genesis and Sega CD games on the docket, just about anything's possible. Here's hoping we somehow get some Lunar games or wild FMV titles on this classic console too.
The retro console is up for pre-order on Amazon right now, with a $103.80 price tag and a $21.99 shipping fee. It seems like the new Mini is an Amazon exclusive, so that looks to be the cost of the console.
The Sega Genesis Mini 2 arrives in North America on October 27, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we reported on the relaunch of PlayStation Plus, a fusion of the original Plus and PlayStation Now benefits. Three tiers from cheapest to most expensive – Essential, Extra, and Premium – each offered downloadable games, with the latter two options providing game catalogs in the hundreds. According to the official PlayStation Blog, "the inaugural Game Catalog lineup for the all-new PlayStation Plus" drops for Extra and Premium members this month. Some of the titles include Stray and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. 
Your PlayStation Plus Game Catalog lineup for July includes:

July 13, 2022
Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, one of my favorite games on PlayStation 5, retells the classic steampunk JRPG with a new-gen sheen. You even get to play as world-class ninja Yuffie in her own standalone Intermission Episode. 
The following games are also available on July 19:
Marvel’s Avengers | PS5, PS4
Assassin's Creed Unity | PS4
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag | PS4
Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered | PS4
Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry | PS4
Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection | PS4
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected | PS4
Saints Row Gat out of Hell | PS4
Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition | PS5
Ice Age: Scrat's Nutty Adventure | PS4
Jumanji The Video Game | PS4
Paw Patrol on a Roll! | PS4
ReadySet Heroes | PS4
And finally, the classic catalog for Premium members includes:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last September's Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta's reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. 


Platinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. 

Bayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.]]></summary>

The latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments.

It’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Day 2022 is entering its final hours, so last chance to take advantage of the best Prime Day PC gaming deals. While some good discounts vanished overnight (Prime Day is in fact two days, July 12th and 13th), the majority will keep running until the clock strikes midnight. To save you the bother of sifting through a mighty mountain of bargain bin junk, I've been collecting agreeable Amazon deals on actually good PC hardware right here.
Unlike the kinds of offers you’d find during, say, Black Friday, all the best Prime Day offers are only available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you don't have a membership, you could always sign up for Prime's 30-day free trial - more on that in our guide to everything you need to know about Prime Day, which you can also find further down. Here's some tips on how to find the best Prime Day deals for yourself, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's with all the cute frog-centered indie games right now? 
A Frog’s Tale, Schim, Frog Detective, Paradise Marsh, Olliefrog Toad Skater, Teacup, Frogsong - it feels like we're in the middle of an (incredibly adorable) frog uprising. Not that I'm complaining, I'm more than happy that our amphibian friends are getting the love they deserve and one such game is Time On Frog Island, a cosy adventure where you play as a gruff sea captain who has been shipwrecked on an island that is chock-a-block with, you guessed it, frogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.


The bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.

What’s more, you don’t even have to limit yourself to Amazon – Best Buy are currently matching that price in their own sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kirby has a delicious-looking new multiplayer title heading to Switch this summer. Kirby’s Dream Buffet pits friends against each other in a platforming, snack-devouring race.
One to four players roll their Kirby through four rounds of food-themed obstacle courses, and whoever collects the most strawberries by the end wins. As seen in the trailer, players can use new cuisine-inspired copy abilities to gain the upper hand. That includes morphing into a cupcake that vacuums multiple food items or turning into sentient chocolate bars to perform Kirby’s signature rock slam. 


Kirby’s Dream Buffet supports local and online multiplayer and will be sold digitally and at retail for an unannounced price.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. 
By way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot. You can see the tweet below with a translation:
気温が高い場所でNintendo Switchを使用すると、本体の温度が高くなる場合があります。5～35℃の場所で使用してください。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the word "simulator" in PowerWash Simulator puts you off, please don't let it. Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you're meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you're meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.
After a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.

Nordisk Games, which already owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios and MercurySteam, the team behind Metroid Dread, acquired a 30% stake in Supermassive in March 2021. At the time, Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels said:
Today, Samuels released another statement about the studios' full acquisition that matched his excitement from a year ago:
We enjoyed The Quarry, awarding the summer camp slasher an 8.5 out of 10 and concluding the review by saying, "Once the frantic running through the woods begins, the dark mysteries and thrill of keeping people alive are powerful hooks that will keep you glued in suspense until the credits roll." However, the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Devil in Me, is Supermassive's next big project. Starring Jessie Buckley, you can watch the trailer here.

For AMD's packaged Linux driver stack it only supports those select enterprise Linux distributions and can run into pain points trying to run elsewhere or even say running brand new LTS distributions at times can lack support. There are also challenges in installing/running the ROCm compute stack outside of the few officially supported Linux distributions by AMD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were to distill the concept of Sonic Frontiers into an elevator pitch, it would likely involve the term "open-world" somewhere. However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an "open-zone" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.
Coming off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…]]></summary>

What alarmed owners of the game was a notice by Ubisoft implying that those who purchased it would still lose access in September. Ubisoft has clarified that will not be the case.
For context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it. 
Yesterday, Twitter user Nors3 shared a screen capture of Liberation HD’s now-defunct Steam page, displaying a notice that states, "At the request of the pub…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have long been on the "eh, seems okay" side of the fence regarding Valve's newest lil child. To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go "Oh yeah!", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. 
Last week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. "This is great!", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.

Released only a month after the studio casually announced it would be disbanding, Last Call BBS will be the last game the studio releases. It's a bittersweet feeling for fans, but this final game is not just a goodbye, it's a retrospective dive into the studio’s ten-year-plus run making games. It also acts as a reminder of how flipping good Zachtronics is at making puzzle games, even if they do melt my brain into a puddle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment's career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.
Referred to as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title," a Senior Environment Artist post states:
A single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.
What do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Head on over to the Epic Games Store this week and you'll find two free games and a feeling of deja vu. The games are Ancient Enemy and Killing Floor 2, and it's the latter that triggered the memory trip for me - because it was also free on Epic this week two years ago. But hey, if you missed it, the zombie shooter still one of the best co-op games, so grab it while you can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting one of the best, and most underrated, Pokémon games from the Nintendo 64 library in Pokémon Puzzle League next week.
On July 15, the Panel de Pon-style, tile-matching puzzle game joins the (gradually) growing roster of classic N64 games. Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament. The pair takes on familiar faces, including Team Rocket and Gary, in 2D and 3D puzzle contests, with plenty of Pokémon cheering from the sidelines. 


Pokémon Snap joined Switch Online last month, making today’s news a nice double-whammy for Pokémon fans. You can keep up with every game available across the various Switch Online libraries by checking out our evolving database.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven't posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. 
But man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.

The few I tried were fussy, though, and too much like the kind of cold scientific procedure that turns growing things into industry. With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.
It's a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There's no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.

Like that smiling face with a tear running down one cheek emoji, I've watched friends discuss the trials and tribulations of a great Tigrex hunt and watched YouTube videos breaking down all the cool things you can do with the Insect Glaive.
So, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch. And I think I'm enjoying it? I think those socks could be mine? I just need to stop my brain from short-circuiting first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, "fun" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.
The game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.

A short trailer provides a montage of the stealth-oriented gameplay as well as Gollum’s emphasis on climbing and platforming to traverse Middle-earth landmarks. The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment. 


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum launches September 1 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also coming to Switch sometime later this year.]]></summary>

Ubisoft's pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.

In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.
The current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions' armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios' most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation Twitter account posted a small batch of announcements highlighting upcoming indie games headed to PlayStation. While Cult of the Lamb's impending August 11 release was already confirmed, a few noteworthy reveals and updates should have indie fans on PlayStation excited for the near future and beyond. Here's a quick rundown of the games making their way to PS5 and PS4. 


Inscryption
One of the best and most surprising games of 2021 makes its way to consoles for the first time. The PS5/PS4 version of the horror deck builder features exclusive features, such as the talking Stoat card's audio coming through the controller speaker, haptic feedback support, and atmospheric lighting that, accordion to creator Daniel Mullens, "spills out from your controller."

The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today's new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it's a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

        <updated>2022-07-07T12:17:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.
You can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

Alas, while buyers of the PlayStation deluxe digital edition will also get to enjoy a brand-new port of PSP game Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (an enhanced version of the very first Valkyrie game), Square Enix have decided not to include it in the equivalent PC edition. No, instead we’re being offered three desktop wallpapers, and a special in-game sword. Don your horned helmet and take a deep breath before you watch the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.]]></summary>

More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we're less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic "Father and Son" trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.
I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It's Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.]]></summary>

I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …]]></summary>

Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.
Ubisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.
Until then, are you excited for Skull & Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft's pirate-focused Assassins' Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It's attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…]]></summary>

Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.

Black Forest Games' remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said "The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside." The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.
