In what is absolutely one of the wildest "development hell to success" tales of all time, Deep Silver has announced that its turbulent release Dead Island 2 has already sold one million copies on PC and console platforms, less than a week on from its initial release.
The sun-soaked zombie slayer, which finally hit the market after a chaotic, 10-year development cycle, also debuted at number one in the UK Charts, surpassing new releases Minecraft Legends and Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp and usurping last week's number one, EA's perennial top-slotter FIFA 23. Deep Silver notes that players/slayers have already killed over a billion zombies since launch, while biting the sand themselves somewhere in the region of 28 million times. Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

Dead Island 2, first announced way back at E3 2014, has passed through several developers, went through a number of rewrites and redesigns, and was a frequent running gag throughout the gaming community — A title that never seemed to ever reach fruition, yet simply refused to go away. As I wrote in our review, the final result isn't exactly a Game of the Year contender, but sports a healthy sense of humor, deeply satisfying combat, and smart and attractive visuals, resulting in a title that will definitely go down as having one of the most surprising "happy endings" in game development history.
Dead Island 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cello choons.
We love a bit of Salmon Run here at Nintendo Life. The Splatoon 3 game mode takes the usual 'ink, swim, repeat' format of your standard Turf War Battle (not to cast any shade, we love a good Turf War too) and throws in the added distractions of a never-ending onslaught of enemies, bosses, and eggs. What's more, it has a cracking soundtrack to make the dash to the goal feel just a touch more frantic.
While the tension-filled tunes might not make the most relaxing listening on their own, Nintendo of America has released a video that shows what goes into making these tracks, and the concentration is immense.

Animal Crossing isn't particularly known for being scary. In fact, the scariest thing about New Horizons is the fact that official support for the game ceased after a little less than two years.
Yet that hasn't stopped content studio Sawhorse from utilising the general aesthetic of the franchise for a rather spooky anti-smoking commission for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Uploaded onto its official website and subsequently archived on YouTube (thanks, Nintendo Wire), the ad campaign is a visual representation of the anxiety that can arise from nicotine cravings. It showcases a cute, Animal Crossing-inspired character hopping into bed before a fiery smoke monster rises up from the floor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't walk away, Renee.
There’s nothing quite like a good Metroidvania. Dense labyrinths to traverse, many kinds of demons/undead/monsters to slay, new equipment to find, hazards to leap, and, most importantly, abilities to acquire that allow you to explore even more. We’ve gotten quite a few stellar genre entries in the last decade, but now we have another that aims to join the most memorable of them: Aurogon Shanghai’s Afterimage. This sprawling, anime-inspired take on the genre double jumps and air dashes with the best of them, though it isn’t without its quirks.
Afterimage opens with a vague, Dark Souls-like overview of how its world has decayed, depicted with a series of gorgeous, hand-drawn images. We understood none of it. In fact, the narrative is a convoluted mess of fantasy pronouns and anime girls; even after a dozen hours, we still didn’t know what was going on other than that, taking control of a young magical girl named Renee, we had to seek out a cloaked girl that stole her master’s soul. Joined by a sassy spirit called Ifree, we were off through hand-drawn biome after biome, whacking a wide array of enemies with whips and great swords as we explored every nook for treasure and upgrades.

For context, The Portopia Serial Murder Case is a classic adventure game from the '80s, authored by Dragon Quest's Yuji Horii. This actually marks its first official release in the west, years later, and it's got a new visual style and layout to go with it.
Much like the original Portopia, this new version is also a text-parser adventure. This means you type commands in, or speak them using Speech-to-Text in the new version, to investigate and explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Worthwhile-est game award
Last time at the Destructoid Institute of Critiquing Kusoge, I looked at Castlevania for the N64. We’ve established that the Castlevania series has never been very good when it comes to its 3D titles, but the N64 games are likely the most worthwhile.
The second title on the N64, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, is easily the worthwhile-est. That’s mostly because it’s essentially an apology for Castlevania 64. Love it or hate it, it’s hard to deny that Castlevania 64 had the signs of rushed development. This wasn’t anything overly major – most of its glaring problems today aren’t atypical for the time period it was released – but it comes down to a lack of polish. More notably, but less noticeably, Konami cut two characters of the planned four.

The union consists of 144 employees across Sega of America's QA, localization, live service, marketing, and product development departments. This is notable, as union efforts have often been led by QA departments.

Fans of '90s JRPGs, particularly those released for the SNES, will have been watching Trinity Trigger closely. The game boasts a veritable dream team from some of the best JRPGs of the past 30 years, including those who worked on Xenoblade Chronicles, Octopath Traveler, and, of course, Secret of Mana. There is a lot for Trinity Trigger to live up to; fortunately, it managed to exceed our expectations in most areas.
The world of Trinitia is at the centre of an unending war between the Gods of Order and the Gods of Chaos. To prevent destroying everything in their conflict, the gods agreed to choose a champion and have them fight in their stead, but not before several of their weapons, called Arma, were scattered along the surface. Giant spears, axes, and swords have become home to monsters and scavengers alike, while the gods wait to see whether the Warrior of Chaos or Order will prevail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That’s a lot of hexagons
Camlann Games has given us a little peek at Code::Arts’ upcoming 4X civilization builder, BoC: Birth of Cultures. While the “teaser” doesn’t show much of the meat in Birth of Cultures’ stew, it does portray its scale.
BoC: Birth of Cultures features a world map that is “more than” 491,000 hex tiles in size. I’m no math person, but by my calculations, that’s a lot of tiles. For perspective, the largest map size in Civilization VI is 6,996 tiles. The map is apparently based on “realistic simulations.” Rather than using traditional fog of war, Birth of Cultures instead utilizes the planet’s natural curvature to limit what you can see. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole flat/round shape of the earth is still under heated debate.
https://youtu.be/tBmAIsq0eKg
On this large playfield, you’ll be overseeing the growth of a civilization starting from the ice age. You start as a nomadic tribe and progress through 60,000 years of development. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole length of human history is still under heated debate.
The announcement highlights the size of the playfield and the effects of terrain and climate. However, Birth of Cultures promises a dynamic progression system and features a “sandbox-like combination of progression and cultures.” I’m not entirely sure what that means, but I’m going to assume it’s a bold stance on something.
BoC: Birth of Cultures remains exclusive to PC via Steam for now. It is set to release into Early Access later in 2023.

Publisher XD Games has announced that its long-in-development pseudo-sequel Torchlight: Infinite will makes its official debut on PC and mobile platforms, as a free-to-play release, on May 9, 2023.
Torchlight: Infinite, the fourth release in the high-fantasy, dungeon-crawling franchise, originally released into Early Access in the fall of last year, but is now set to make its official debut next month. In alignment with the launch date, the game will enter its new season, titled "Cube of Rapacity" and bringing a major overhaul to Torchlight: Infinite's loot and crafting systems, as well as the addition of a new character, Escapist Bing, and a variety of new systems, including the powerful "Divinity Slate".
https://twitter.com/torchlight_xd/status/1649871334544138243?s=20
Torchlight: Infinity, while carrying the Torchlight name, is not a product of the now sadly-defunct Runic Games, who created the franchise back in 2009 and would receive critical and player plaudits. This initial release would be followed by rock-solid sequel Torchlight II in 2012. Following Runic's closure in 2017, brand owners Perfect World would release inferior second sequel Torchlight III in 2020. Torchlight: Infinite, now developed by XD Inc. is a continuation of the franchise in a free-to-play PC/mobile vein, and features typical hack-and-slashing, dungeon-crawling action, although presented with more of a futuristic, cyber-fantasy aesthetic.
Torchlight: Infinity launches May 9 on PC, iOS and Android platforms.

With its open world, shrines, weapon degradation, and ‘rune’ abilities, Breath of the Wild most certainly made some significant changes to the games that came prior, but we have to ask ourselves here: just what constitutes a “traditional” Zelda game, anyway?
From a story perspective, Zelda games have always followed a pretty similar path: you play as a hero who must embark on a grand adventure to save the land and defeat evil. That’s always been the case, whether you’re talking about the original NES game, Ocarina of Time, or Breath of the Wild. Some titles, like Majora’s Mask or Link’s Awakening, might well feel different in how they approach their respective narratives, but those games still boil down to the same essentials.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vex means frustrate
Apogee Entertainment has pulled back the veil on Emberheart Games’ open-world crafting adventure Vexlands alongside a trailer. It will debut on PC in early 2024.
Placed in a vacant world, your job is to literally carve out your place by crafting and selling resources to buy new tiles in the procedurally-created world map. Each tile has the possibility of introducing something helpful or harmful into your environment, making each one a gamble. Your goal is to strengthen your homestead while venturing out into five biomes to lift the curse that has befallen the land.
https://youtu.be/RjrAMPhi56k
Without fail, a cash-centric approach to an adventure always reminds me of Freshly-Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland. I kind of doubt that Vexlands will center around the populace’s greed, but on the other hand, I hope so.
Honestly, the survival-crafting grounds have become well-stomped territory at this point, but Vexlands catches my eye for a few reasons. The first is that I absolutely love when an adventure has a cozy central base to unwind between adventures. That’s not uncommon for the genre, either. However, Emberheart Games handles development on Vexlands, who have previously done faithful remasters of Apogee classics like Crystal Caves, Secret Agent, and Monster Bash. It’s largely a solo developer headed by Primož Vovk, but they seem extremely passionate and hardworking with their projects, so I’ve had them earmarked since their release of Secret Agent.
That’s to say nothing of Apogee’s newest iteration, which is still helmed by founder Scott Miller. They seem really jazzed about their return as an indie publisher, and there’s a lot of charm in that optimism.
Vexlands only started development a few months ago, but Scott Miller estimates it’s about 25% done. As of writing, it will release only on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online coding requires a little more tweaking
CyGames has announced that it has had to, unfortunately, postpone its upcoming beta for Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising — Originally scheduled for PlayStation platforms in May, the beta will now take place at a later, currently unspecified date.
"The game is currently experiencing stability issues during online play," wrote creative director Tetsuya Fukuhara in a short statement on Twitter. "While we realize that some bumpiness is to be expected during beta testing, we would still like to put our best foot forward and ensure we deliver as enjoyable an experience as possible."
"In order to test our recent implementation of rollback netcode, we will be launching a closed pre-access beta, followed shortly by an open beta. For those who would like to participate in the pre-access beta, registration will open when we announce the updated schedule. Thank you for your patience."
Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising, which was first announced during the Granblue Fantasy Fes in January this year, is a fully updated edition of the 2020 anime fighter, produced by veteran studio Arc System Works. The new edition will feature additional characters — including the buxom shepherd Anila — as well as new mechanics and stages, a story expansion, and a full rebalancing of all characters.
While not the most popular fighter on the block, GBF:VS is a great scrapper, and this new edition will help extend its lifespan and, hopefully, bring new fans into the fold.
Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is scheduled to launch on PlayStation and PC later in 2023.

The photos apparently come from an internal brief which showcases how the set should be presented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. 
Whether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.

Following this weekend's closed beta, publisher Activision has released the intro cinematic for its slapstick brawler Crash Team Rumble, which sees the heroes and villains of the Crash Bandicoot universe gather together for cartoonish, platform-fighting chaos.
The delightfully colorful and highly dynamic sequence sees characters such as Crash, Dr. Cortex, "He's Literally Me" Dingodile, and the schlub-bothering Tawna Bandicoot scrapping out on the sunny Wumpa Island. Coco is on their side? Heel turn! Produced by Thai animator RIFF Studio, the 90-second intro is packed with colorful excitement, as Crash — through dexterity, assistance, and sheer luck — manages to get the Golden Wumpa to the goal, scoring a point for all that is good and just in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDHbh-rlKu4&t
Currently in development for PlayStation and Xbox, Crash Team Rumble looks to gather the Crash community for multiplayer mayhem, as they choose their favorite characters and utilize their unique skills and abilities to bring home the Wump Fruit for their team in four-vs-four action.
While tempting to typify the title as "Crash Smash Bros.", the game seems less focused on the actual fighting and more on point-scoring and objective completion. Developer Toys 4 Bob has already confirmed cross-platform support, and the new title will be looking to rope in the fanbase for this new take on the series. No Ripper Roo, no sale.
Crash Team Rumble launces June 20 on PlayStation and Xbox platforms.

His newest video, however, is a bit more simple, but it's a rather lovely showcase of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's fantastic variety of stages. Between Battlefield — the Smash Bros. series classic — and the final game added to the game via DLC, Hollow Bastion (from Kingdom Hearts), there are a mammoth 115 stages to battle it out on. And all of these stages are fantastic representations of the games and series' that they originate from.

Fans of Guerrilla Games' Horizon universe, as well as its irrepressible hero, Aloy, will be pleased to hear that we can expect much more from the robot-filled dystopia, following comments from the studio that casually reference (at least) one more title in the visually-stunning adventure series.
The comments came following a shake-up of Guerrilla staff, which sees studio director and executive producer Angie Smets leave the developer to take up a new role as PlayStation Studios'  head of development strategy. In Smets' absence, production director Joel Eschler and general manager Hella Schmidt will receive promotion within studio ranks, while current studio director Jan-Bart van Beek will retain their role at Guerrilla, overseeing all current and future projects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbl2wfyAgxY&ab_channel=PlayStation
In comments discussing Smets' departure, Guerrilla notes that it "[has] full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project." essentially confirming the continuation of the franchise. This news will hardly come as a surprise to anybody in this franchise-heavy gaming zeitgeist, but it's still a nice bit of security for franchise fans.
Most recently, Horizon Forbidden West received a new expansion in the form of DLC Burning Shores, which sees Aloy travel to a dystopian (but somewhat familiar) new locale, where she meets new friends, encounters terrifying new Machines, and takes up arms with a selection of new weaponry. Despite a battalion of review bombs — derived mostly for the most eye-rolling of reasons — the DLC has been mostly well-received by both critics and Horizon fans.
Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms. Burning Shores is available on PS5 only.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As our shuttle hits the ground, the world erupts into smoke, chaos, and confusion. Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it. She punches Samantha full-on in the face, knocking her unconscious (“Oh, I guess that’s what ‘knock out’ means,” I realize a moment too late). Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.
For fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it’s exiting early access for a full release, it’s safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I’ve seen yet.

        <updated>2023-04-24T12:18:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. 
This news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. 


Within that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. 
"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project," the statement reads. 
As you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the "exciting online project" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. 
In terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will "be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine." 
This statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after "an incredible 20 years" there:

Out later this year, it's a combination puzzle-platformer and conscruction game in which you play a wombat, wearing a hard hat, who constructs increasingly complex things out of his own feces. That is no way to make a skyscraper, wombat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That means Sobble is in play too
Thanks to an announcement from the official Japanese Pokemon site, we know that the famous water sniper Inteleon is coming to Pokemon Scarlet & Violet as a 7-Star raid event. Inteleon was introduced in Pokemon Sword and Shield as a starter and became one of the most endearing and enduring 'Mons of that generation. The sassy-looking Inteleon has a super unique design, and it even dons a sniper perch in its Gigantamax form. It was also my starter pick, and I cherish it to this day!
Here's all the info we have on Inteleon's return
The event will be held from April 28 at 9AM JST through May 1 at 8:59AM JST: with a repeat event echoing from May 5 through May 8 at the same time
Like prior events, it'll have the Mightiest Mark (a title unique to these raid events)
It'll sport the Ice Tera Type
You can only catch one per save file, but you'll be able to fight it an unlimited amount of times for loot
Following in the footsteps of prior events, Sobble and Drizzile are coming to Scarlet & Violet as well
Using the egg-breed method in Scarlet & Violet you'll be able to hatch a Sobble, which then evolves into Drizzile at level 16 (and Inteleon at 35). So that's technically three new Pokemon that appear in each 7-Star Tera Raid event.
When coupled with all the loot you get (including Ability Patches), that's not a bad reward for your time!

The US Federal Trade Commission is attempting to get more information from Nintendo regarding the 10-year licensing deal it signed with Microsoft to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms.
In a report published by TweakTown (via My Nintendo News), the FTC apparently subpoenaed (an order to produce documents or information related to a case) Nintendo of America's vice president of publisher and developer relations Steve Singer after learning that Singer was responsible for the discussions between Nintendo and Microsoft. The FTC reportedly wants the exec to stand and give a testimony for up to seven hours.

Capcom has released a new update for its smash-selling remake Resident Evil 4, bringing with it a selection of bug fixes that, among other things, removes the previously published "key item" glitch, and also, (unfortunately for some) puts a stop to a sneaky wall-walking hack.
The new patch, available now on PC and consoles, features fixes to several platform-specific problems, including visual rendering problems on Xbox Series X/S, incorrect subtitling on PlayStation, and the removal of a bug that would render the game incompletable due to a rare bug that would occur while trying to obtain a key item during Chapter 12 of the game — You can now swing your knife with reckless abandon. This patch also tweaks the dead zone properties of the Xbox analog sticks.
But the update also removes the ability for the player to utilize a hack known as "Scope Warping" — A trick that allows Leon to glitch through certain walls while using the scope on his sniper rifle, or occasionally the iron sights on any weapon. The Resident Evil speedrunning community, savvy as they are, had already been using this glitch to fine effect in their efforts to complete the mission as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, once the game has been updated, this option is no more. It seems that launch builds will need to be acquired should the community wish to utilize the glitch in their future speedruns.
Resident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Square Enix's stuffed slate of releases over the past year has given us some stellar titles, but among some of their biggest releases, this year's Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo should not be overlooked.

Has it sunk in yet that almost every single mainline Final Fantasy game between I and XII is now available on the Switch? That's thanks to this week's release of the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series, which was long, long overdue.
Back when the games launched on Steam and mobile between 2021 and 2022, lots of people were happy that the classic six Final Fantasy games were finally being made more accessible. But there was one big talking point that swept across the world when it came to the Pixel Remasters — the font.

The League of Legends universe is pretty big at this point, as the MOBA has spun out into series, collaborations, and even other genres. The Mageseeker is the latest of these efforts to create a compelling story within the world of Runeterra, creating a new flavor of League storytelling with an action RPG coating. And, for the most part, it works.
Developer Digital Sun, known for their own previous action RPG Moonlighter, definitely makes its mark on the League timeline. A focus on Sylas, the once-chained mage now caught between his potential as a revolutionary and his selfish desire for revenge, lends itself well to both a different kind of story and an interesting take on combat.

You find me at the end of a pretty heavy week, which has seen me operating on very, very little sleep, thanks to some medicine-induced insomnia. I'm most certainly looking forward to resting up today, and I hope that, wherever you are and however you're doing, that you too find the opportunity to take some time for yourself and recover from the trials and tribulations of the week.
Have yourself some coffee and cake. Or whatever floats your throat boat. I know I'm going to be treating myself today, and I think that you should to. Ahhhh, that's some quality enabling.

Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get cracking with this week's rumble, let's take a look at how the votes panned out last time. We took a look at Professor Layton and the Curious Village for the DS and, holy moly, it was actually a rather close call. North America won out with 48% of the vote, with Europe just missing out with 41%. Finally, Japan wasn't quite able to win the hearts of our voters and pulled in just 11% of the vote.

A lot of people may remember Advance Wars series as a flash in the pan, popping out of nowhere on the Gameboy Advance and then dying out a few years later on the DS. But in Japan, the Wars series was one of Nintendo's longest running, prolific franchises, starting on the Famicom before spreading its military might to the Gameboy, Super Famicom, GameCube, and the Wii.
For folks who had been following the franchise for the 20 years up to its abrupt conclusion, hearing that Intelligent Systems had no "clear idea" on the future of the franchise felt like the end of an era. Likewise, for longtime fans, this month's Advance Wars: Re-Boot Camp remakes from WayForward has a lot more weight to it when you know how much strife this series has been through.

Something particularly fun and adorable from Hamster this week, as it bolsters its mammoth Arcade Archives range with the addition of Namco's cutesy '90s shmup Cosmo Gang the Video, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to Japanese arcades in 1992, before receiving a home release on Super Famicom shortly thereafter, Cosmo Gang the Video is a spin-off shooter featuring characters that appeared in iconic redemption game Cosmo Gangs, a title which saw the player battling to prevent a squad of crazy-eyed creatures from stealing energy boxes to take back to their home planet. Cosmo Gang the Video adapts these characters and settings to a vertically scrolling shmup format, a genre in which Namco had proven itself a frontrunner.
https://youtu.be/kfI4Z_P5joA
One to two players pilot the "Hyper Beat" space vessels, on a mission to fend off the Cosmo Gang, who has returned to cause further mayhem across the galaxy. The player battles waves of formation-based enemies over the course of 30+ stages, picking up power-ups and new weapons in order to even the odds against the Cosmo Gang's seemingly endless numbers. It should be noted that, despite its latter-day release date, the title is simplistic, even dated, when compared to the contemporary shmups of the day. Despite this, the arcade saw great success in its native Japan.
Cosmo Gang the Video is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. You Check out the very silly action in the video above, courtesy of YouTuber Insert Coin.

It's 2009, and I go to my first-ever midnight launch for a game. Infamous was the next big exclusive game for the PS3, and I was incredibly excited. I was in my final weeks of high school, in the middle of exam season in the UK. I took the game home, unwrapped it, and played all night until around 7 am. I had an exam the following day, but I didn't care. I just had to play that game.
Fast forward to 2023, and I couldn't tell you what exam I was supposed to be studying for. I couldn't tell you whether I passed it or failed it, and it doesn't matter. The memory of lining up for the midnight launch of Infamous and playing it all night will stay with me forever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sound of the Round
With Street Fighter 6, Capcom is looking to revitalize the energy and the aesthetic of its flagship fighting franchise — This is perhaps best demonstrated in the audio/visual style of the new sequel and its roster, every member of which is embodying a fresh "back to the streets" design style — A style equally reflected in their respective character themes.
Here is every Street Fighter 6 character theme released to date, as well as the hype-building title theme "Not on the Sidelines" by Rocco808 and Randy Marx. Which of the character themes are doing it for you? My personal favorites are Ken, Juri, Lily, and Kimberly. Let us know what you think.

Content creator and self-styled Pokémon archivist, Lewtwo, has announced that they’ve managed to obtain high-quality scans of the original Pokémon artwork by Ken Sugimori. While the original Twitter thread in which Lewtwo reveals these scans does a great job of explaining where they’re from and how they’re significant, here’s a quick rundown.
The scans themselves come from the Japan-exclusive Pokémon Gold and Silver Pokédex. In other words, this wasn’t something provided as a special case from Nintendo. The images washed out when they came West, but so many sources distributed them that they became ubiquitous. Speaking to Kotaku, Lewtwo clarified that it’s taken so long for the West to get better scans of the originals because we’re so used to seeing the low-quality cop…]]></summary>

Suburban Basketball is one of those games where I’m completely uncertain if the developer, Quinn Tonelli, intended it to be art, but that’s how it ended up. You’re probably either going to look at the below screenshots and either scoff and assume I’m daft, or you’ll say, “Oh golly, this sings to me.”
It’s a Doom mod that escaped from the shallow grave where we left Web 1.0. It’s the sort of dream that dial-up modems wake up screaming from. It brings me back to the days of exploring the filthy, disease-ridden alleyways of the ‘90s and early 2000s. That’s how I know it’s art: it elicits a reaction, even if that reaction is flashbacks of fever dreams caused by a combination of heat stroke and researching how to catch the Pokegods.
It’s not a very good game, which is fine. I…]]></summary>

Hi-Fi Rush was a bit of a surprise drop earlier this year, and certainly made a splash. But as a report circulated that it did not hit its revenue target, Xbox is saying that Hi-Fi Rush was a break out hit.
The back-and-forth started when journalist Jeff Grubb, on the Game Mess Decides podcast, said that Hi-Fi Rush fell short of what it "needed" to do.
"Based on what I've heard, it just straight up didn't make the money it needed to make," Grubb said. "And, I mean, it got good reviews, buzz was good. So where do you put the blame for something like that? And it's like, is it the price? Was it the shadow drop? Or could it have sold more? Or is it Game Pass?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is our new song
Content creator Markiplier has announced that he’ll be writing, directing, and starring in a film based on David Szymanski’s short-form horror game, Iron Lung.
Released in 2021, Iron Lung became a surprise hit. Oh, hey, I’m even quoted on the Steam page. I absolutely loved it, as it was everything short-form horror should be. It was short, inventive, and also horror. It was more atmospheric than scary, so some people told me they found it boring, which hurt my ego. My recommendations are a lot like my children. I send them out in the world without fulling preparing them, and if they don’t succeed immediately, I feel unreasonably disappointed.
In any case, this adaptation of Iron Lung aims to be a theatrical feature. I’m not sure how you turn a 30-45 minute interactive experience into a 90+ minute feature without losing some of the mystique, but here we go. While Markiplier is writing and starring in the film, David Szymanski has been involved and assisting, and that includes helping create the script.
https://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1649452805818658817?s=20
Many of the details surrounding the adaptation are under wraps, but we do know it will co-star Caroline Rose Kaplan. Markiplier is financing the film by himself. While it hasn’t been revealed if the film will follow the plot of the game – which involved using a submarine to explore an ocean of blood in a universe where all habitable planets abruptly disappeared – David Szymanski says he “couldn't be happier with how it's turning out so far.”
I don’t have many strong feelings here. I play things, but I rarely watch them. Therefore, both Markiplier and films as a whole are in my periphery, along with sports and human interaction. There’s no reason an Iron Lung movie couldn’t work, so here’s hoping the team can pull it off.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Square Enix is showcasing some possibilities for AI tech, and it's using an old classic to do so. The Portopia Serial Murder Case is getting a PC remaster on April 23 with its AI Tech Preview, with brand-new Natural Language Processing tech.
Artificial intelligence use in games has quickly become a hot-button topic, and for good reason. The rise of systems that generate text, images, or anything else has open a bit of a Pandora's Box in terms of original sourcing, ethics, and specifically for games, how something gets made.
I'm starting here because, well, Square Enix has a history with new tech trends. So when I first saw "AI Tech Preview" appended to a re-release of 1983's The Portopia Serial Murder Case, I was skeptic…]]></summary>

Publisher Focus Entertainment continues on its journey to grow as a company and as a brand within the market, announcing that it has acquired Railsimulator(dot)com, the parent company of train sim studio Dovetail Games.
The purchase sees Focus secure 100% of all Dovetail Games shares, as well as ownership of the British studio's niche-but-popular IPs such as Rail Simulator, Train Simulator Classic, and Train Sim World. The studio itself will continue to run under its own steam (no pun intended) via the current leadership team. Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, Focus spoke of its excitement in purchasing the genre-dedicated developer.
https://twitter.com/Focus_entmt/status/1649088666529304577?s=20
"We like their business model based on fully-owned IPs and creating recurrent revenues from regular content updates to a passionate and committed community of fans," explains Focus Entertainment CEO Sean Brennan. "Dovetail is perfectly aligned with our strategy and is led by a very talented senior management team who are excited about growing the business further."
"[Dovetail management] will keep their distinct culture and way of managing the business for sure, a policy that we have followed with all our past studio acquisitions. We hope we can add value in a number of areas though in order to bring their fantastic games to a wider audience."
Dovetail Games joins Focus' modest but burgeoning portfolio, which also includes Lords of the Fallen developer Deck13, Space Hulk: Deathwing's Streum On Studio, Metal Slug Tactics' Leiker Studio, French studio Douze Dixiemas, and finally the hugely successful, retro-driven outfit Dotemu. Focus also has a close relationship with acclaimed studios such as A Plague Tale's Asobo Studio and Atomic Heart's Mundfish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Come on in. Please, take a seat. Welcome to the inaugural episode of our brand new (and currently untitled) supporter-first indie video show! Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.
My aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.

(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general. They really have been that bad, folks. Proper rancid stuff).

It's not that it's particularly simple, but it feels so damn clean and effortless to play. You'll know what you're doing in minutes, but still find a decent challenge, with lots of options but minimal analysis paralysis. I'm honestly finding it hard to fault.

A new gameplay update is out for Dota 2, and it's a big one. Seemingly everything, from items to hero attribute types and abilities, has been adjusted or altered, and even the map is getting a bit larger.
The 7.33 patch for Dota 2, dubbed the New Frontiers update, hits many points. And though Dota updates have been traditionally massive compared to other live games, this one might be the most game-shifting since at least the 7.0 update.
For starters, the map itself is now 40% larger. New structures line the lanes, with objectives like the Lotus Pools and their fruit, or the vision-providing Watchers. New runes dot the landscape, and neutral creeps—the monsters that live in the jungle between lanes—have been updated and overhauled.

Players can take on the CPU or a local friend in exhibition bouts, utilizing a team of 15 characters pulled from KoF XV's massive roster of sluggers. It should be noted that the demo is standalone, and will not carry over any data should you pull the trigger on a full purchase.
The 15 characters included in the demo are *deep breath*
Athena Asamiya (Super Heroine Team)
Benimaru Nikaido (Hero Team)
Chizuru Kagura (Sacred Treasures Team)
Chris (Orochi Team)
Dolores (Rival Team)
Heidern (Rival Team)
Iori Yagami (Sacred Treasures Team)
Isla (Rival Team)
Kula Diamond (Krohnen Team)
Kyo Kusanagi (Sacred Treasures Team)
Mai Shiranui (Super Heroine Team)
Meitenkun (Hero Team)
Ryo Sakazaki (Art of Fighting Team)
Shun’ei (Hero Team)
Terry Bogard (Fatal Fury Team)
Released in February of last year, The King of Fighters XV is an excellent entry in SNK's storied series, featuring a huge roster, incredibly deep and complex mechanics, and audio and visuals upgraded from its predecessor. This year will see SNK release several further characters to the title, including intolerable KoF '98 boss Goenitz, fan-designed vigilante Najd, and the nightmare bundle of cuteness that is Svlvie Paula Paula.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most exciting and mysterious elements of Street Fighter 6 has been a World Tour, a single-player open-world exploration mode Capcom had previously only shown glimpses of. Thankfully, today’s Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.
World Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall. 
As a fledgling fighter, you’ll embark on a quest to become a world warrior. You’ll accomplish this completing qu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.
"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game," executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. "We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year."
During Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.
If you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2. For more on the game, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV may have gone gold, but Blizzard wants to ensure the servers are durable one more time before launch. Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. 
This next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.
Server Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:
The Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)
The Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)
The Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)
A new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).
Diablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It’s also Game Informer’s cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing the game during the 2022 Game Awards and giving the game a proper trailer last week, Ascendent Studios is back with a new showcase for the title, this time focused on gameplay. The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.


Along with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.


For a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here. You can also expect even more from our trip in an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine.]]></summary>

In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together.

Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered
Tesldagrad 2 was announced last August, and it's out today. Like the first game, you'll need to harness electromagnetic powers to solve physics-based puzzles throughout Scandinavian environments. Doing so will ultimately require players to master the art of Teslamency. The art style looks great, and you can check that out and more in the new Tesldagrad 2 trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wait has been long but it's almost over because Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out in just a few months. 
Developer Night School Studio revealed today during a Nintendo Indie World Showcase that Oxenfree II is out July 12. It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. 


Set five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. 
This time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. 
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mineko's Night Market, the upcoming delightfully charming social simulation adventure from Meowza Games, finally has a release date and it's out in just a few months. 
More specifically, Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26. Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. 


In Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. 
But some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. 
In the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. 
Mineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023. It then comes to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an alternate world where Arkane made The Crossing, and it’s not necessarily a better one. Before Dishonored, the developer was looking down the wrong end of a bad publishing deal which, in the estimation of founder Raphaël Colantonio, would have ended in either The Crossing’s cancellation or a deeply underwhelming end product. In that timeline, there’s no telling whether the studio would even exist today.


Nevertheless, for fans of Arkane’s sophisticated and immersive first-person adventures, this lost project remains tantalisingly forbidden fruit: a foolhardy mashup of single and multiplayer in which teams of invading players would attack the protagonist of a solo campaign, against the backdrop of a multiversal Paris co-designed by Half-Life 2’s Viktor Antonov.

It's a genuine marvel how I'm able to lay on the couch and play Like A Dragon: Ishin, or stream Resident Evil 4 - with admittedly, a ropey success rate - to it from my PC in the other room. I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.
But my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After bingeing the Netflix show Arcane and getting hooked on the world of League Of Legends, I was disappointed to find there weren’t too many single-player games for those who aren’t the MOBA-type of keyboard mashers. The top-down action RPG The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is looking to fix that, though, letting you play as the ex-convict and buff mage Sylas while he’s busy running a revolution. It comes from the developers behind the Zelda-like shop roguelite Moonlighter, and it's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m too prejudiced against first-person melee games to enjoy Dead Island 2 as much our reviewer Rick Lane did, but even a mind as narrowed as mine can appreciate its slick performance on PC. I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.
Alas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.
Let’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.
Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes.

Nintendo and WayForward took a risk in bringing Advance Wars back from the scrap heap with Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, releasing a set of tactics-heavy games in a genre now defined by character relationships. The remakes change little from the original releases and don’t deepen the story or cast, but they don’t have to change anything. Advance Wars’ unique features are as apparent as ever. If anything, they’re made even stronger by the series’ extended absence.
Advance Wars is light on story compared to other tactical RPGs. The nations of…]]></summary>

To put this price into context, this card normally retails for at least $45 and was closer to $60 for Black Friday last year, so this is a good deal that matches the best price we've ever recorded for this size and model - and one we recommend as one of the best memory cards for Steam Deck.

Thankfully this week Indiescovery is all about change, as we're experimenting with a brand new format. A group review! We've all been playing Dredge, the eldritch fishing adventure by Black Salt Games, and hoo boy do we have some thoughts about it. Spoilers: much like Katharine, we all think it's really really good.


Elsewhere, the review bonanza continues. Rachel's been rewriting fiction in Storyteller, I've been reclaiming the wasteland in Terra Nil and Rebecca has been dating hot monsters in Romancelvania. We also chat about burgers, olives and our current hyperfixations because hey, this is an episode of Indiescovery after all.

Taking established fictional universes in new directions is an idea we should all be behind. Too often, licensed games hew too close to established characters or scenarios, and those beloved fictional frameworks are never given a chance to grow. With Tron: Identity, Bithell Games takes the venerable Tron franchise and tries something entirely different – a visual novel with a light touch of puzzle gameplay. The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.

The closed beta is completely free and begins on May 9th, so if you want a test ride, you can register at this link. In the meantime, publisher Bandai Namco have also released a new, more in-depth gameplay trailer, giving us a closer look at some of the minutiae involved in running a theme park.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that "really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy".  
But in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.

Unlike traditional Nintendo Directs, Indie World showcases only show third-party indie titles coming to the Switch, so don't go in expecting to hear news about Mario or Zelda. Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, "Silksong" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.
Which games do you hope to see at the showcase tomorrow? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

That’s after the graphical option was quietly removed from both games this past week, following a recent update. Fans had been wondering if the move was deliberate or not, but Capcom’s announcement seems to confirm that it was just a mishap. So, zombie slayers should be able to go back to running around in realistically lit corridors full of shadowy corners very soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To pre-empt your first question, no, Dead Island 2 was not worth waiting eleven years for. In its defence, however, few things are. If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.


Dead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.

Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after its 2011 predecessor, but the sequel has taken nearly a decade to come to life. Developer Dambuster Studios is the third studio to work on the game, using this opportunity to create its own Dead Island 2 from the ground up. While assumptions might be made about a game that’s spent this long in development, jumping from multiple teams, the final game is a worthwhile follow-up, especially for fans of the original. Dead Island 2, much like its predecessor…]]></summary>

Developer Jonathan Smårs took to Twitter yesterday to tease a bunch of difficulty presets and customisable sliders, letting you modify the Viking experience to your liking. The options include both a creative mode (a là Minecraft) and a more 'immersive' option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve and CodeWeavers have released the latest version of Proton, their compatibility software that allows Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems – like that of the Steam Deck. Proton 8.0 is a biggun, smoothing out compatibility issues for over a dozen games (including the Dead Space remake and Forspoken) while making Steam Deck-specific fixes to many more.
These include an update that should make the repeatedly troublesome 2K Launcher behave itself again, while Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands gets improved sleep/resume functionality on the handheld PC. A crashing issue with Life is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.
Downloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done. Begone, foul keyboards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV arrives on June 6, and that date now feels more concrete because Blizzard announced today that the game has gone gold. That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.
The game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.
“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”
Diablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joseph Staten, known for his work on the Halo series, has been hired as a Creative Director on an unannounced Netflix Games project. In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a "AAA multiplatform" experience. You can read the full tweets below.
So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2
April 17, 2023
Staten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.
This is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.

Video games often rely on the trope of saving the world from an impending apocalypse. Those world-ending events usually come via megalomaniacal supervillains or extraterrestrial invaders, but what happens when the threat to our planet is us? Terra Nil poses that question, placing you in charge of restoring a world ravaged by the effects of climate change and human civilization. The result is a distinctive “reverse city builder” that weaves compelling mechanics together, creating an enjoyable experience with a good message.

After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. 
Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer.

April 17, 2023
The show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).
Plot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior.

That being said, ColePowered Games' detective immersive sim has really left me stumped, forcing me to hang my deer stalker on a hat peg in shame and sling my detective's notebook out a window. Shadows Of Doubt is like no other detective game I've played, and although its murder mysteries have left me spiraling, I've had an absolute riot playing it.

It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I think of quintessentially British games, a few highlights come to mind. Fable's fairytale world of stocky goblins and poverty-stricken orphans with Victorian-era voices is definitely very British, as is Banjo-Kazooie’s dry wit and sarcasm. A decent bucket of contenders, but the crown has to go to the Greggs Simulator, a free shop sim that tasks you with managing a Greggs pasty shop that's a staple of every UK high street.

A new audience can now experience one of PlayStation’s best exclusives, but even better, modders can get their hands on Joel and Ellie’s trek, rejigging a familiar story in new ways. There aren’t too many exciting ones available to download just yet, but one “in-progress” mod reimagines the game in first-person, and it’s stunning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. 
But actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list.

        <updated>2023-04-17T14:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has announced it’s acquiring Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game company behind Angry Birds.
A press release states that Sega will absorb the entirety of Rovio’s outstanding shares and options (€706 million in total) in what’s being labeled as a “friendly takeover” since Rovio’s board of directors agree to and support the acquisition terms. This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. 
“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”
“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”
Rovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.]]></summary>

Microsoft’s DirectStorage has only so far only found support in the ho-hum Forspoken, and PCIe 5.0 SSDs still aren’t widely available despite the first compatible CPUs and motherboards launching in 2021.
However, the latter are coming soon, and I’ve been testing out an engineering sample of the Crucial T700 to see how PCIe 5.0 – also known as PCIe Gen5 – drives could perform in an honest-to-goodness gaming PC. The short version: with maximum read and write speeds that tower over the current generation’s best SSDs, albeit with less impact on game load times than such explosive pace would suggest.

It's got bunkers in which your party rests, de-stresses, and tools up before moving on.

Kind of a Fallouty, XCOMy, FTLy, Vermintidey mix, then - which together seems very cool. It's out now, and there's a demo.

Oh, and I suppose a free content arrived this week too, adding new side-missions, handy new combat abilities, and a new "rogue-lite" mode. The update, uh, apparently also added Denuvo, over a year after the game launched? Cool, cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, for the first time in a long time, I stayed up way past my bedtime playing a video game. I had left weird abiogenesis idle clicker The Barnacle Goose Experiment running in the background for a few days, dithering a bit any time I stumbled back across the browser tab, until one day it hit me. I don't remember what it was, but one discovery was so strange and exciting that I then sat there for four hours, thinking "I'll go to bed when this result comes in", and then. Woof. I am now far too old to stay up past my bedtime playing video games, and am still tired. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has revealed a new company logo, and fans of the letter R are sure to be pleased as punch.
It’s been 20 years since Remedy updated its logo, but above is the image that will appear on the studio’s projects going forward. That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. 
In a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: 
“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  
It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”
So there you have it. What do you think of Remedy’s new logo? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd planned on starting with a line about how Loretta is an exception to how psychological horror games are about trudging around an abandoned mental hospital with the worst torch in the world until the girl from Ringu menaces you. It was already interesting and good enough pretty much right away to earn a recommendation, but after one of what will definitely be several playthroughs, leaving my praise that faint would do it a terrible injustice.


Loretta is goddamn excellent by any standard. Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with "turns out you're secretly crazy", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Forbbiden West gets a big story expansion called Burning Shores next week, and the game’s launch trailer sets the table for Aloy’s dangerous excursion to the remains of Hollywood. 
First revealed during the 2022 Game Awards, Burning Shores unfolds after the events of Forbidden West as Aloy travels to the ruins of Los Angeles. The untamed area has become a seismically unstable, volcanic archipelago where a new menace and never-before-seen machines await Aloy, who's now joined by a mysterious new companion. 


Burning Shores is only available on PlayStation 5 and cost $19.99. Players will need to have completed the entirety of the main campaign to start the expansion. Once they have, Aloy will receive a call on her Focus which will kick off the DLC. 
Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores launches on April 19. You can read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

I mean, I barbecued some womb in a restaurant in Japan recently, and I can confirm that it was like calamari but tougher, and, largely, a lot worse. So, that's why the idea of Pringles releasing a limited-edition Minecraft Suspicious Stew flavour intrigues me! I would like to give it a go and see if it's actually quite nice or makes me barf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's brutal working culture isn't exactly a secret. You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.
Mr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness. Completable in one sitting, it's a game I'd recommend to anyone.

It's a challenging climb yet a curiously chill vibe, perhaps because any time I fall all the way down, I'm delighted to be back surrounded by overgrown plants and sculptures rising from a pond. The developer says Beton Brutal "tries to replicate and build upon the parkour mechanics seen in Minecraft," and I think I have a lot to learn. I didn't even know Minecraft had parkour.

Frakenstein is often cited as the first science fiction thing, and now it can add to its honours because it's the inspiration for the first major update to V Rising. The info on Secrets Of Gloomrot doesn't actually use the F word anywhere, but it's a new biome "twisted by the tortured ambitions of a scientific genius and his legions of followers", so I feel pretty confident in the citation. This new free addition to the early access vampiric survival game - which won a few hearts here at RPS - is arriving on May 17th. That's in a month, that is, and boy, it's a biggun alright.

Mojang Studios has returned to the crafting table in an attempt to take Minecraft in a bold new direction. Minecraft Legends is an open-world real-time strategy game where you gather resources, build defenses, and summon adorable mercenaries to protect the sanctity of the realm. Instead of the birds-eye perspective often featured in strategy games, Legends opts for a character-focused view, with your hero roaming the landscape on dynamic mounts, sword in hand, using resources and armies to e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!
Or it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.
Welcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.

It's now official. Suicide Squad will now release on February 2nd, 2024 rather than in spring 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation State of Play was devoted entirely to showcasing new footage and information for Final Fantasy XVI, giving fans a guided tour of its action, exploration, characters, and more.


The presentation showed off a hefty amount of the flashy action RPG combat we recently got to sample in a recent hands-on demo. Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. 
We also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. 
Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck is powered by SteamOS, a custom Linux-based operating system developed specifically for running Steam and its games. It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.

A leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. 
The superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.
Although we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.
Officially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. 
“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”
Mario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. 
This is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.]]></summary>

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.

In a landscape where many major shooters have adopted the free-to-play model, it's extremely hard for a new IP to enter the ring. Titans like Fortnite and Apex Legends don't just have large, dedicated audiences—their respective development teams have spent years refining gameplay in response to player feedback. Competing in the space is an incredibly intimidating task, but amazingly, after playing two hours of Ubisoft's XDefiant, I'm optimistic that it might have what it takes.

The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.
Additionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.
Needless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.]]></summary>

The presentation airs Thursday, April 13 at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern and will showcase new Final Fantasy XVI gameplay. The blog post suggests that this will be the only game featured, but we'll see if anything else pops up.
Square Enix recently provided hands-on demos to the press, giving us first-hand impressions of the game's combat, dungeon crawling, accessibility features, and other mechanics. We're curious to see what else they have to show that hasn't yet been revealed. 
Final Fantasy XVI is a PlayStation 5 exclusive and will launch on June 22.]]></summary>

In a blog post, the studio states that live support will conclude after September 1. That means it won't receive any new updates, but players can still install and play Dreams – including creating and sharing games – after that date. Previously announced updates will still hit the game before September, such as patches improving animations and the Create mode, as well the Tren update. Events such as DreamsCom, Impy Awards, and All Hallows Dreams will no longer take place as well.

The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

EA returns to the PGA with an inconsistent, frustrating simulation, struggling with its identity. While gorgeous, with pro golf’s best interactive presentation, the on-the-course action delivers inconsistent results.
In licensing, EA wins, scoring the Masters and key courses like Pebble Beach. Presentation counts, like the Masters’ first day showing opening tee shots from Jack Nicklaus and others. Quiet commentary meaningfully discusses each hole during flybys. Gorgeous vistas line the courses, and every individually rendered bl…]]></summary>

For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu.

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!
