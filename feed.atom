It's New Proper Platforming Mario Game Week, everyone! While the launch of a game with Mario in the title is a fairly regular occurrence, the release of the plumber's first all-new 2D platformer in over a decade is cause for special celebration. Super Mario Bros. Wonder brings back Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom brethren in a mainline series entry that we deem to be "the slickest, sharpest, and smartest that two-dimensional Mario has felt since 1991" in our review.
And it's Super Mario Bros. Wonder, remember — Nintendo's most famous sibling is right there and playable from the start, as he should be. In honour of this evergreen fraternal relationship, today we're looking back at all the other sibling relationships and rivalries in the Nintendo canon. The Mario brothers may be the most famous, but they're far from the only ones!

Recent reports to the USTR reveal the names and locations of platforms giving rightsholders the most piracy-related headaches.

        <link href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/suika-game"/>
        <updated>2023-10-22T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripe and ready.
A couple of years ago, a Japanese company called Aladdin X released a digital projector, and it included a fun little fruit game called Suika Game as part of its software. Suika Game was so well received by people who bought the projector that the company decided to port a version of it to Switch, but the game launched there to almost no audience response. Then, two years later, it randomly became a viral sensation in Japan after a few streamers made it popular. Now it’s quietly made its way to the eShop outside of Japan, and while it’s admittedly very basic, it’s hard to say that Suika Game lacks appeal.
Suika Game could best be described as “2048 with physics”. You drop fruit onto a board, with the goal of getting matching fruits to touch so they fuse into a bigger fruit, granting you extra points. The tough part comes in with the way that the fruits don’t neatly stack on each other. Each new fruit dropped in will roll around a bit and usually push others out of the way, often blocking access to fruits beneath it. Inevitably, this causes the board to fill up all the way and then you have to start all over.

One drawback thus far has been that there was no native integration with the Unreal engine. That has now changed thanks to a new open source plug-in created by The Chinese Room.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new web event for Genshin Impact to promote the release of its new OST album, but some seemingly AI-generated artwork featured in the event leaves a lot to be desired.


The web event is called “Glad Tidings from Afar,” and you’re supposed to listen to some of the new Fontaine OST tracks, then send them as gifts. The recipients include various Genshin Impact characters, represented by chibis. When you send some music to a character, you’re “rewarded” with an animated version of their chibi emote. 


The problem is that some of these animated Genshin Impact chibis were very clearly made using some kind of AI tool. Tighnari, for example, can’t decide how many fingers he’s supposed to have or which way his thumb is supposed to be facing.

Earlier today, Day 1 of the London Fan Festival kicked off and Yoshida returned to reveal more details about the expansion.


We already knew two jobs were on the way, but not what they were. Now we know one of the two is going to be the melee job Viper. The Viper dual-wields swords that can be combined into a single double sword as well. The class will share gear with the Ninja class. According to Yoshida, the Viper is an original class but took inspiration from Zidane from Final Fantasy IX. The Viper is designed to appeal to those who want a new dual-wield job that is not Ninja.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvest Dew.
If the 'Uncanny Valley' is the term for something being almost-human-but-not-quite, then Harvest Moon: Winds of Anthos is in the Uncanny Stardew Valley. It's so close to being a really good farming sim game, but doesn't quite manage to hit the mark. However, for the first time in the turbulent and confusing history of Natsume's Harvest Moon games, it's actually... fun.
The story is the same old, same old: the Harvest Goddess disappears after some catastrophic geographical event, and it's up to us to restore her and the world through the power of farming. The twist here is that a volcano erupted, and Ms. Goddess decided to build a bunch of walls around all the villages, thus both protecting them and isolating them in one fell swoop. You'll have to dismantle the walls, befriend the Sprites living inside them, and revitalise the towns within, mostly by completing various fetch quests. The story doesn't make a lot of sense — everyone is very chill about getting separated from their families for a decade — but it's good enough to get started with.

Sega is certainly no stranger to wafting in self-nostalgia. After all, it has been shoving its old-school arcade roms into games since the days of Shenmue. Remember Space Harrier? Sega will never let you forget. 


The trend has continued for decades, and that's the only reason I knew what I played was something I've experienced a few times before. No, it's not Space Harrier (enough with Space Harrier!), but if you've played Yakuza or Judgment recently, you should recognize it too.

When everything is running well, it feels like Lords of the Fallen had the potential to be a landmark Soulslike title. But those situations are few and far between. I had hoped that the back half of LotF would highlight the good. Unfortunately, things got worse, and the final hours of my experience were a slog and, to put it bluntly, just not fun.


Boss fights seemed to get more and more tedious and just outright unfair. And as I progressed, the amount of performance issues and bugs I encountered just kept increasing. There are times when I really had fun with Lords of the Fallen. But those times were far and few between.

While Cyberpunk 2077 was initially going to have a multiplayer component, it vanished like a fart in the wind. However, that hasn't stopped me from fantasizing about what could have been. Plus, I also need to justify my obsession by getting her into this universe.

It was 1996 in Japan and 1998 in North America (and a year later in Europe) when the ageing Game Boy got an unexpected shot in the arm thanks to a little game named Pokémon. Nintendo's granddaddy of handheld gaming suddenly had a new lease on life, but in the West the release of the game was followed just weeks later by the arrival of a new console — the Game Boy Color — and it was on that wonderful system that many of us caught our very first Pocket Monster.

First step, catching up with horror movies. My favourite new one so far is Dark Harvest (on Amazon Prime), a nice bit of folk horror colliding with the 1960s American dream. But what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

If you were curious to know if there was any bad blood between Nintendo and Microsoft after certain Xbox email leaks, apparently not.
In a new interview with Inverse, Nintendo of America's president Doug Bowser insists the creator of Mario maintains a "great relationship with Microsoft" and its gaming division Xbox. He goes on to mention how this has been proven time and time again throughout the Switch generation with games like Minecraft and even the addition of Banjo Kazooie in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't worry gamers, you can stop killing The Lich King on ten alts every week for your chance at the Invincible mount. The popular but rare World of Warcraft mount from the Wrath of the Lich King expansion is now available in Diablo 4. And don't worry...if you are fearing the grind, it's not necessary here. Instead, all you need is a credit card!


That's right, instead of purchasing a quality game, you can spend just $25 to get enough Platinum for the cool mount. The Invincible Aspect bundle is available now for 2,500 Platinum through the Diablo 4 store. In case you were wondering, you can get 2,800 Platinum for $25. There's nothing in the store you can spend the leftover 300 Platinum on, but that's OK! I mean come on, it's the Invincible Mount in Diablo 4!


Screenshot by Destructoid


You are not prepared


Sorry if I'm sounding facetious here, I just hate it when a full-priced $70 game locks its coolest cosmetics behind an overpriced purchase. There should at least be a way to get the cosmetic in-game, even if it requires some sort of farming.


The Invincible Aspect bundle includes four cosmetics:



Invincible Aspect Mount


Bard of Undying Loyalty Mount Armor


Domination Helm Mount Trophy (The Lich King's helmet)


Echo of Frostmourne Mount Trophy (The Lich King's weapon)



Screenshot by Destructoid


In World of Warcraft, the mount has a 1% drop chance from the final boss in the Icecrown Citadel raid. As if that's not rare enough, you can only clear the raid once per week on each character. Some players have been farming the mount for years with no success.


I was going to get the Diablo 4 Invincible Mount but as you can see in the screenshot I was 2,440 Platinum short. Maybe next time!

I’ve probably already lost half of you, but it was worth it. For the rest of you who remain, I’m mostly kidding. Mostly. I think history is misremembering Battletoads as a landmark series, when most people only played the first two levels of the original title and never saw past the Turbo Tunnel. Let me tell you, it doesn’t get better from there. But before anyone really had time to let the trauma set in, Rare had ported it to a myriad of platforms.


Battlemaniacs is weirdly derivative of the original title. But, hey, the 1994 arcade game is pretty good.


And then there was Battletoads and Double Dragon. The concept is just incredible, taking the grandfathe…]]></summary>

I first played this game two years after its 2020 release, in the summer of July 2022, jobless and depressed. It felt good to exist in a world where capitalistic business executives make inhumane decisions about the last of humanity living in their Dharma Tower, except instead of suffering under their thumb, I, or rather, protagonist Ghostrunner, took a katana straight to the top to bring it all down. The game concludes with humanity free and Ghostrunner liberated from the A.I.-powered Cybervoid trappings under a new name: Jack.

Notably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 has seen a wave of unionization across the video game industry, with new unions popping up at companies like ZeniMax Media and Sega of America. Now Nintendo of America president Doug Bowswer has commented on the possibility of a union at his company. 


In an interview with Inverse, Bowser was asked what role unions might play at NOA in the future. Bowser touted NOA’s success without a union, pointing to its high employee retention rate. “Our focus has always been on creating a culture that's inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces,” Bowser said. 


An inclusive culture creates a great foundation for employees at any workplace, but some still see unions as key to securing better pay, benefits, and treatment from a company. Bowser acknowledged that unions aren’t off the table at NOA. “Everyone has the right to form a union, and certainly in the future, wherever it takes us, we'll respect that," Bowser told Inverse.


The state of Nintendo


In April 2022 Kotaku published a report in which former contractors alleged that they were mistreated and never offered a legitimate path to full-time employment. “They want to control you like you’re full-time, but not treat you like a full-time worker,” one contract worker said. 


IGN published a similar report in May 2022. Some workers interviewed for the piece complained of “a huge disparity” between themselves and full-time employees. The company has previously faced labor complaints for allegedly cracking down on discussions of unionization.

Of the notable things he said about it, one about Nintendo accounts is particularly intriguing.


“But one thing we've done with the Switch to help with that communication and transition is the formation of the Nintendo Account," Bowser told Inverse. "In the past, every device we transitioned to had a whole new account system. Creating the Nintendo Account will allow us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's just a week away from Alan Wake 2's release, and we've finally gotten a look at the PC system requirements. It's a game that attempts to push graphical boundaries and competes with AAA titles from around the world, so it is no surprise that the requirements are quite steep. 




Regardless of your settings, you'll need 16GB RAM and Windows 10/11. Like a few other AAA games released this year, you also require an SSD with at least 90GB free. As for the CPU, Remedy is asking for a Ryzen 7 3700X or Intel equivalent for all settings except for the lowest where an Intel i5-7600K or AMD equivalent can be used.

The lowest settings will have you playing at 1080p at 30 FPS. To hit this, you'll need a GeForce RTX 2060 or a Radeon RX 6600. You'll also need 6GB VRAM. For a balanced experience that runs at 1440p at 30 FPS, ensure you have a GeForce RTX 3060 or a Radeon RX 6600 XT. The game also requires 8GB of VRAM. 


Ultra settings are for enthusiasts because you'll need a monster of a machine to pull it off. With ultra settings, you can play at 4K at 60 FPS. You will also need 12GB VRAM and a GeForce RTX 4070 or a Radeon RX 7800 XT. 


There are also settings for ray tracing included. Anyone hoping to get maximum ray tracing requires an RTX 4080 GPU. It's a big ask, but it may be worth it, as Control demonstrated Remedy's excellent use of ray tracing. 


The next chapter in Alan Wake's story is almost upon us, but he won't be coming alone. This time around there's a second protagonist, Saga Anderson, who has a nose for sniffing out a mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer One More Level and publisher 505 Games have pulled back the DLC curtain plans for its upcoming first-person parkour-action game, Ghostrunner 2, ahead of its release next week. As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.
As for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. 
Check out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: 


Sometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. 
Buying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. 
For more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember how RoboCop: Rogue City was coming to Switch? No you don't, because it's not happening! Nacon has confirmed that their plans for a Switch version has been quietly tossed in the dumpster.


This might not be much of a surprise. The Switch logo hasn't been shown on the game's trailers since at least the Future Games Show that was held in August. It was, on the other hand, on its gameplay reveal trailer from last year. So, it seems that a Switch version was at least considered. Gematsu reached out to Nacon to get confirmation and was told, “At this moment, we don’t have any plans for a Nintendo Switch release.”


Normally for a licensed game, this wouldn't be a huge loss, but I recently played the Robocop: Rogue City demo, and it instantly shot up my list of anticipated games. I was not expecting that. Not only does it capture the feel of being a walking refrigerator, it also ties in deeper elements to complement its gunplay. My only question at this point is if it can maintain that quality for the game's runtime. If so, I'll be stunned, blown away, and many other hyperbolic statements that will hopefully get me into the accolades trailer.


As I mentioned, however, a Switch version of Robocop: Rogue City was never heavily advertised to start with. However, there's evidence that it was considered, but they decided not to go through with it. This might have been technical difficulties, lack of budget, or any number of other reasons. Still, it's a bummer for gamers who prefer to stick to Nintendo's handheld hybrid.


Did I mention how amped I am for this game?


RoboCop: Rogue City is still coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 2, 2023. And I'm very excited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spider-Man 2 has only recently hit shelves but already Insomniac is thinking about the future. The first Spider-Man game received a spin-off, Miles Morales, so it's natural to wonder whether the sequel will also feature a sequel, perhaps this time starring Venom. According to senior narrative director Jon Paquette, Insomniac is waiting to see how the fans react before they decide on the direction of a possible spinoff. 


As Paquette explains, the main question Insomniac asks itself is "what do the fans really want?" Then, they try to give them that. After Spider-Man 2's successful launch, the studio does need some recovery time but discussing ideas will resume once everyone has "had time to sleep and take vacations."

Venom and his 19 inches


In Paquette's interview with Insider, he reveals that the aim was for the game to be "one of the best Venom stories you've ever experienced." To do this, they would need an amazing voice actor, and it was found that Candyman's Tony Todd was the man for the job. When crafting the tale, Insomniac drew from the Spider-Man comics, but the studio still puts a unique twist on things. 


It's not hard to imagine a Venom spin-off being celebrated, as it appears the character has already struck a chord with players. Part of his popularity comes from a viral PlayStation Tweet falling victim to bad phrasing when describing the Venom statue that comes with the Collector's Edition. 


In Spider-Man 2, Venom's symbiote is discovered to help heal sickness and make its host feel stronger than ever. The longer it sticks around, however, the more it shows its sinister side, but by then it may be too late. 


Venom is a handful, but Peter doesn't have to face him alone. He receives help from Miles Morales, who you can also play as.

Some have genuinely captured the magic of the mouse and co., while others have simply cashed in on one of the hottest family-friendly licences on the planet.
But what of gaming's most family-friendly console? Does Switch have Disney games? Of course it does, but what's the best Disney game on Switch?

They feel as though the roads, as well as the people on them, were created by someone who has never been in a vehicle before.


Alaskan Road Truckers has a lot of problems, but the biggest one is that the central gameplay – the driving – sucks out loud. Part of this is the driving controls and vehicle physics in general, but the other part is the world around your truck.


One of the first things that struck me was a bump in the road. Right by your HQ is this big dip followed by a hill, and if you hit that thing at a speed faster than a crawl, it will pop your rig up. I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE 10/20/2023: The recently released Spider-Man 2 is also missing the Chrysler Building. In its place is the same building that replaced it in Spider-Man Miles Morales, though this time with a new coat of paint. 
See below for comparison shots of the Chrysler Building in Spider-Man 1, captured on a base PlayStation 4, and the new building in Spider-Man 2. 
Sony did not respond to our request for comment in time for publish (though it might be safe to assume the reason it gave us three years ago might still be the case here. More on that below).

One of New York City's most iconic landmarks, the Chrysler Building, was removed for the recent release of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The building was not only featured in Marvel's Spider-Man video g…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment design director Josh Sawyer has said that he'd be well up for making a new Pillars of Eternity RPG, given a budget on par with Baldur's Gate 3. Specifically, he'd like to build on Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire's combat system, and use a "scripted 3D camera" that avoids some of the fuss of exploring the world and navigating the interface of Larian's game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo and the city of Seattle, Washington, have a surprisingly interesting history together. The most notable example of this is when former president Hiroshi Yamauchi purchased a majority stake in the Seattle Mariners when the team struggled in the 1990s. It was an odd moment in sports and gaming history that remains a fun fact.


Nothing so notable has happened since, but Nintendo still has a noticeable presence around Seattle. The Pacific Northwestern city hosted the first Nintendo Live outside Japan, and Nintendo of America's headquarters is in Redmond, Washington, a city in Seattle's county. Still, it's fun seeing the interesting partnerships between the city and the company.


In another fun and fitting crossover, the Seattle Aquarium is hosting its own Nintendo promotion, but thi…]]></summary>

The squishy physics driver/platformer series, JellyCar, wobbled its way onto Switch last year with the release of JellyCar Worlds. Today, developer Walaber is giving us yet another blast from the past as it adds the levels from the WiiWare / DSiWare sequel, JellyCar 2, to the proceedings.
For those who have never stumbled across the wacky yet wonderful concept of JellyCar before, let us bring you up to speed. This is a classic car platformer but with the twist of all the surfaces and the car itself being made of jelly (come on, we've all wondered about it). You have to squish and speed your way through each level, relying on the laws of physics to keep the wobbly wagon on the road.

He slowly shuffles out of bed, keeping the light off to avoid waking his wife and his 18-month-old son. He goes out through the bedroom door, and along the hall, to his office. He sits back in his chair, and he gets high. 


In the last nine months, Gaurav has spent £2,000 on his secret addiction. He admits to a total spend over eight years of more than double that. That is, £4,250 is the amount he admits to when talking to me – he’s never told his family. But Gaurav isn’t addicted to drugs, or alcohol or even online poker. The reason Gaurav only gets a few hours of sleep each weekend, is because he can’t stop playing FIFA Ultimate Team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I loved the premise of Deadnaut. It's the tactility of chunky spaceship interfaces combined with the frustration of the corporation cheaping out on everything and not caring that it'll get everyone killed. It's the desperate crews exploring derelicts out on the fringes of the known, where terrible, unspeakable things have been unleashed. Alien by way of Duskers.
I didn't love playing it, though. It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it's sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.
Even though it's a bloody roguelike. Godddd.

Detective Pikachu Returns has been out on Switch for a couple of weeks now and it's... well, just as sweet as we would expect, actually. While it wasn't on any of our 'Nintendo 2023' bingo cards, it looks like the team behind the game sees room for future entries in the series (thanks, VGC).
This news comes from a recent Famitsu interview with Creatures Inc. managing director Hiroyuki Jinnai and Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara. The former noted that Returns will be the final game in the Detective Pikachu storyline that focuses on our coffee-chugging investigator and human partner, Tim, but he wouldn't rule out the chances of a spin-off title in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  
It's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as "initial piano concepts" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It's so, so, so good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking forward to Halloween? If not, see you at Thanksgiving. If you are, Steam is once again about to kick-off one of its many sales events. This time, it's all about the spooky (I refuse to say "spoops" in earnest).


In a recent video uploaded to YouTube, Valve announced the Steam Scream: The Revenge fest begins on October 26, going on until November 2. Keep an eye on this page for details about what deals and discounts will be on offer.




As usual, we don't know the specifics of what games will be featured, but we do know it's a celebration of all things horror-related.


For example...


In the trailer above, you can see glimpses of some of the titles participating in Steam Scream. It looks like there's a healthy bunch of AAA and indie games to look forward to.


We can see clips from Black Mesa (the ambitious fan remake of Half-Life), Metro Exodus, Little Nightmares 2, DEVOUR, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, the Dead Space remake, GTFO, Hollow Knight, and more. In short, it looks like it's going to be a pretty interesting fest for us horror fans.


This time of year is always a hoot for the genre. Steam especially seems to keep its finger on the pulse when it comes to Halloween. As a long-time lover of horror gaming, the next week or so is going to be an exciting one for me. Although, the scariest thing will be how I'm going to be able to afford all these discounted titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user Korodic has recently uploaded a mod for Starfield that incorporates dead body collision. In the vanilla experience, once a character ceases to be, they also cease to have any physical form, making it possible for others to just glide right through them.


Are you tired of being able to walk through the dead bodies of Starfield like they aren't there? Wish it was possible for NPCs to step onto the corpses of those who lie in the way like human speed bumps? Well, wonder no more, as this modder has got you covered.

Why, I've had my immersion shattered watching the residents of Akila City not be able to nudge the corpse of someone I killed in cold blood. What kind of (fictional) world is this where NPCs can't even stand on the rotting cadavers that litter the streets?


Not one I wish to live in, it seems


Thanks to Korodic's mod, you can now enjoy a more immersive experience in which dead bodies will now "move when the player or an NPC walks into them or jumps on them." The report from DSO also says that this doesn't impact the game's performance, meaning that if you're playing the game on PC, you may as well install it.


Starfield is a funny old thing. While it was the best-selling game for September in the US, it doesn't quite feel like it has the staying power of something like Skyrim. Its star has already dropped as people look forward to the next major release.


I could be proven wrong, but without the modding community, it feels like Bethesda's newest IP won't have the legacy of some of the studio's previous work. Call it a hunch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want some early Tango Gameworks horror, you can pick up 2014's The Evil Within for free through Epic Games Store right now. However, the offer won't be on forever, so you best pick up a copy before it's too late.


According to the Epic Games website, you can get this Shinji Mikami title for exactly zero dollars until October 26. The deal only covers the base game, however. If you want the DLC as well, you'll have to fork over for them like some sort of pleb.




The Evil Within comes from the creator of the Resident Evil series. His resume features a host of other praised games, including Devil May Cry, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and, in a change from his usual horror outpourings, Hi-Fi Rush.


Oh, one more thing


Maybe you've already played Evil Within, but haven't got around to playing the 2017 sequel. Fear not, for that's also going to be free through Epic Games as of next week. Pretty much as the deal for the original ends, the one for the follow-up begins. That's handy.


We're not far from Halloween now, so everything and anything related to horror is going to be coming out of the woodwork. This is probably not the best time of year for those who aren't into spooky games, but for those of us who are, it's like Christmas came early.


Oh, I almost forgot. To go alongside The Evil Within, you can also pick up a copy of Cosmonaut Studios' first-person story-driven puzzle game Eternal Threads. That should keep you busy until the end of the month.

FuRyu has made a name for itself in recent years of being a publisher that does a great job of churning out RPGs that you’ll certainly like, but probably not love. Games like Monark, Caligula Effect, and Crystar have all offered players some decent yet flawed experiences, and now the company has brought us yet another entry in this long line called Crymachina. Though it seems to take some cues from Crystar, Crymachina is a brand-new IP set in the far future that sees you fighting a seemingly endless horde of creepy robots with a bunch of depressed girls. It’s ridiculous, it’s fun, and it’s not great, but it may still be worth your time.
The narrative places you in the role of Leben, a girl who promptly dies of a mysterious illness in the first 10 seconds after cursing at the world and all the people who live in it. She is then resuscitated 2000 years in the future by a mysterious AI named Enoa, who has brought back a couple of other high school girls, too. Enoa explains that humans went extinct due to a world war over dwindling resources, but a team of scientists launched a spaceship called Eden just before the end in the hopes that one day humanity might rise again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series is nearly here, bringing more than 180 new cards. Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. 
Speaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.
Check out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steamforged Games is heading back to the world of Sony's Horizon series for Horizon Forbidden West: Seeds of Rebellion, and the Kickstarter campaign will go live on November 21.


The boardgame and miniature maker has made a name for itself over the years with tabletop adaptations of Dark Souls, Horizon Zero West, Monster Hunter, and Resident Evil, alongside a slew of original properties such as the hugely enjoyable competitive hex-based battler Godtear and dungeon-crawler Bardsung. 


Details on Horizon Forbidden West: Seeds of Rebellion are reasonably thin on the ground, but Steamforged Games has said that this time out, it's a fully co-operative experience that can be played either solo or with up to four players. The story is also canon within the lore of Horizon, so fans of the series have that to look forward to. 


For folks curious about how the story will be implemented in the game, Steamforged Games has the first entry in a diary series from lead designer Fraser McFetridge that runs through some details on how the narrative works.


The game will be set before Aloy's arrival in the Forbidden West, as rebellion and unease are growing amongst the Tenakth clans. It will be up to you and your fellow players to get to the bottom of the rebellion and stop it in its tracks before a tide of violence erupts across the land.


Best of all, there will be a whole new range of miniatures included, and the range of Horizon Zero Dawn products that Steamforged Games already has available proves that Guerrilla Games' beautiful machine designs translate wonderfully into miniature form. 


Anybody interested in watching the campaign or picking up the game can head on over to the official Kickstarter page and hit "Notify me on launch," as long as you have a Kickstarter account already.

Silk is a more recent addition to the Marvel canon, first appearing in the 2014 relaunch of The Amazing Spider-Man series. The character, created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, is one of several heroic leads that have expanded the scope of the Spider-Man universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 launched on PS5 this week, starting a new chapter in one of PlayStation's flagship series. The importance of the game for the console cannot be understated, as it is one of the biggest current-gen PlayStation exclusives to date. A recent Bloomberg report suggests that Peter and Miles' latest adventure could be the key to the kind of PS5 sales growth Sony is looking for. 


 As the report highlights, though the PS5 has been a popular console, it has faced a few circumstances that have limited how many units could be sold. One of the biggest hurdles was the COVID-19 pandemic which constrained the company's ability to meet demand. Consequently, the PS5 has sold 40 million units since launch in 2020. This is a good number, but the PS4 managed to do it in about two and a half years.

High hopes for Spider-Man 2


Sony is hoping to sell 25 million PS5s this fiscal year. Supply chain issues have been resolved, and the company has also revealed smaller models set to release this holiday, which should help boost sales as well. 


There is reason to believe that Spider-Man 2 could help Sony achieve its ambitious goals. The first game from Insomniac, as well as Miles Morales, together sold 33 million copies. Its proven track record for drawing in fans makes Spider-Man one of the PS5's key franchises. 


Research director Lewis Ward predicts that the game "will eventually sell tens of millions of copies." This isn't hard to believe, as Spider-Man 2 has been receiving excellent critical acclaim. It's a fun game with plenty of action, humor, and Easter eggs for long-time fans of New York's favorite web-slinging crime fighter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard rolled out Diablo 4's Season 2, also known as the Season of Blood, this week, together with an absolute deluge of quality-of-life improvements across console and PC. The publisher have also now launched the hitherto Battle.net-based PC version on Steam, and are trying to attract newcomers with a discount on Valve's platform and a free 10 hour trial this weekend (that's 19th-22nd October) for Xbox players.


Have the Season 2 updates - which you could summarise as "slay vampires to get vampire powers" and "spend less time and have more fun grinding/farming for loot and levels" - salvaged Blizzard's action-RPG from the ashes of Season 1? I've been trawling the reactions this morning, and while the new Diablo appears to be evolving in the right direction, the big picture is still of a game with just as many raters as haters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. 
It's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has released details for this weekend's Free Play Days event, and Diablo 4 is one of the titles. From October 19 until October 22, all Xbox members, even those without Game Pass, have access to a 10-hour gameplay trial. This makes Diablo 4 the first Timed Trial game that is part of Free Play Days, but honestly, it comes at a great time. Season 2 of Diablo 4 is a lot of fun and is a great opportunity for prospective players to have a fun Action RPG experience over the weekend. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a similar option is available for PC or PlayStation.




For those with Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'll also have access to NBA 2K24, Lawn Mowing Simulator, and Hokko Life during this Free Play Days event. As always, your progress across all of these titles, including the Diablo 4 trial, is saved. So, if you do end up deciding to purchase the game after the event, or even at a later date, you will be able to pick up where you left off.


Alongside the 10-hour trial, Diablo 4 is also on sale for 25% through November 1. Altogether this is a great chance to try out the game and if it tickles your fancy, you can purchase it at its lowest price yet. 10 hours is plenty of time to know if you are going to like what Diablo 4 has to offer.


Diablo 4 Season 2 is live now on all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has announced the next Stellaris expansion, titled Astral Planes. The new narrative-focused expansion will allow players to wield reality-breaking technologies to explore alternate dimensions. In these parallel universes, players will encounter new creatures and phenomena as they journey into the true unknown. There was no specific release date given for Astral Planes, but the release does say it is coming to PC later this year.




The story-centric expansion will feature branching narratives, a first for Stellaris. Players can navigate a branching narrative built specifically to make choices matter. According to Paradox, Astral Planes will be full of surprises and hard choices. Decisions will not only affect the narrative but also shape the player's empire to fit their playstyle.


In terms of gameplay features, Astral Planes will feature new Technologies, Actions, and Relics, which is pretty par for the course for this type of expansion. It also appears there is a new Origin called Riftworld. 


Stellaris is my favorite Grand Strategy game, so any new content looks good to me. But depending on how the Astral Planes actually works, this could set the 4X title up for even more content avenues in the future.


Stellaris: Astral Planes will be released on PC later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of DreadXP’s Indie Horror Showcase, Philisophic Games has pulled back the curtain on Hellpunk, a horror game about hitting things with things.


I’ve got a dearth of information here, but Hellpunk seems to be a game trying to nail the ever-elusive feeling of melee combat in a first-person game. It uses somewhat lo-fi graphics, and all the press material I have just says it’s about angrily killing foes. The foes consist of CRT-headed dudes and other assorted weirdos. Don’t worry about creating CRT-headed orphans, however, because apparently, you’re fighting “through the depths of the human mind.” The very angry depths.




To be fair, though, the short, 22-second trailer says a lot. Beyond the trippy visuals, first-person melee is a carrot that few have even touched. 2005’s Condemned: Criminal Origins is often cited as one of the few games to even come close to making it work. I’m currently straining to think of another game that did it well following that. Doom (2016)’s glory kills come to mind, but it’s just hitting a button and watching Doomguy be all vicious. That really doesn’t count.


So, yeah, that’s all I got, aside from the fact that it calls itself “Murder-punk.” We’ll have to wait and see if Hellpunk manages to achieve what has been lost.


Hellpunk is coming to PC via Steam. Its page is available to wishlist, but there is no target release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios has shown off their upcoming remaster, System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, at the indie horror showcase. This updated version transplants the 1999 classic to the KEX Engine, bringing with it all the modern comforts that the engine offers.


Nightdive has really been moving on these remasters. Star Wars: Dark Forces was just recently announced along with Turok 3, while SiN Reloaded got shunted a bit to the side to make room. System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition has been in the pipeline for a while, however, with it being promised to anyone who pre-ordered the System Shock remaster.




The Enhanced Edition comes with the added benefit of higher resolution, widescreen, and post-processing effects. The graphics have also been touched up, but in typical Nightdive fashion, they’re carefully tweaked to improve the look without altering the gameplay. It will also be available on consoles for the first time.


System Shock 2 was the first game from Irrational Games and was a sequel to Looking Glass Studios’ 1994 title, System Shock. The title is held in high regard, and its design would influence its spiritual successor, 2007’s Bioshock. I’m sure some fans will be disappointed that Nightdive didn’t completely overhaul the 1999 title in the same way they did the original System Shock, but of the two titles, the latter definitely needed a lick of paint.


There’s still no release date for System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition aside from “coming soon” and “in the near future.” It will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Motive general manager Patrick Klaus has shared new details about the game in a studio update released today, including that the Iron Man game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5. 
Motive released its Dead Space remake earlier this year, and Klaus says with that behind them, the studio's focus "has switched to the Iron Man project, giving us the opportunity to work (and play!) with another extraordinary property." He says the team is still in early pre-production and taking its time to set the best possible foundation for development, but despite that, it is finding "so many opportunities to explore story, design, and gamep…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Mario Bros. Wonder is finally here, and you can celebrate in physical merch form with this new My Nintendo reward. Nintendo now has a listing for the "Super Mario Bros. Wonder Double Keychain," which features Mario in his normal and elephant forms (hence the "double"). It's a little strange having Mario and his presumed doppelganger on there instead of another character, but what are you gonna do: he sells merch!


Mario rewards typically go fast, but at 800 Platinum Points, you'll want to sit and think on this one for a while. Here's a bit more info on the 5"x 6" reward to help you decide: "It also comes with a colorful strap that shows off the new Elephant Fruit, Drill Mushroom, Wonder Flower and Wonder Seed."


What other recent My Nintendo rewards are there?


If you have the sinking feeling that there was a recently announced but yet-to-be-released My Nintendo reward: there is! It's none other than the Detective Pikachu coffee cozy, representing a game that kind of came and went from our collective consciousness. We'll update you when it launches!


As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netmarble, the South Korean company behind Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross and Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds has announced a new update for Tower of God: New World, including new characters, story content, and more. The update also includes various limited time events lasting until November 1.




Urek Mazino (SSR+ [Flight]) and Endorsi (SSR [Child]) join the game in this Halloween update. In fact, the new story content, dubbed “Endorsi and the October Illusion,” is an original event dealing with Endorsi being bullied by her sisters. There’s also an event mission and illusion event exchange shop for October, where players can earn a new outfit for SSR Xia Xia. 


In addition, alternative costumes for Yuri, Rachel, and Lozeal are also available.


It’d seem the only event that’s not set to expire at the end of the month is a welcome back boost where players can earn a variety of rewards simply by playing the game and completing missions every day for seven days in a row. This event is currently ongoing with no projected end date.


Tower of God: New World released for Android and iOS devices (with a PC version available via Google Play Games Beta) this July. The mobile game follows the story of the acclaimed webtoon and anime adaptation, the latter of which premiered in 2020, as part of the Crunchyroll Originals branding. It’d seem a second season has been announced, but as of writing, no release date has been announced.

        <updated>2023-10-19T17:55:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man didn't include the option to replay the story in New Game Plus mode when it first launched in 2018. But Insomniac wasn't lazing about in a hammock made of webbing, either. The developer launched the feature roughly six weeks after launch. Is it coming to the sequel? Oh yes, and now we (roughly) know when: before the end of this year.


New Game Plus (NG+) won't be alone on missing release, as Spider-Man 2 is also getting updated with a mission replay feature too. This update flew a bit under our radar, but like any wily city pigeon, we eventually caught it. Within the replies to Insomniac's announcement of a game up on Twitter/X, the company's community director was hashing out what's coming to Spider-Man 2 post-launch. The director in question, James Stevenson, mentioned New Game Plus mode will release for Spider-Man 2 "before [the] end of [the] year." 





Will New Game Plus and mission replay release for Spider-Man 2 at the same time?


The bonus to the news is that the NG+ mode isn't coming to the game alone. Spider-Man 2 will get a mission replay feature, according to Stevenson. It's not confirmed that it'll arrive alongside New Game Plus, however. In a reply, Stevenson wrote that the team is "working on an update for those features," including NG+, "but they won't be in Day 1." He later clarifies when NG+ is expected to drop, but isn't specific about mission replay.





Either way, it should be exciting for Spider-Man 2 fans who dream of knocking out early-game bosses while fully kitted out. The NG+ update for the original game included two more trophies: 'One More Time' got awarded for playing the game again in NG+, and 'Power and Responsibility' was earned after beating the game in Ultimate difficulty. And yes, you could acquire the latter trophy in NG+.


Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launches on PlayStation 5 on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to tell when you’re done with a game like Cities: Skylines 2. I’ve got a habit of playing anything with a similar hook until I hate it. It’s typically weeks upon weeks of fascination, and then I drop it when I’ve exhausted every point of novelty backward and forwards. It’s not my usual habit, but when I find a sim, a survival game, an MMO, or something of that nature, and it just clicks, that’s usually my go-to for a while.


I find there’s a lot of that pull in most games even tangentially related, whether it’s the building mechanics in Valheim or the budgeting of another Theme Park sim. If you ask me where you’ll find Cities: Skylines 2 on my scale of teeth-grinding fury to infinitely satisfying, it’s hard to say right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Punch Man is great and often hilarious manga/anime about Saitama, the namesake of the franchise, who defeats every foe he encounters with one punch. It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.
One Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.

The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.


Amongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in "revenge" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they've made the continue button "sexier". Look, don't ask me, I just work here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roccat makes some good mechanical keyboards, especially their Vulcan line which combines 'floating' low profile keycaps with pleasant tactile switches, a volume dial and a wrist rest. These keyboards are normally available around the $70 mark, but today you can pick one up from Amazon in black for $48 - a good deal for a full-size mechanical keyboard from a major brand.

It’s important to say that, because it helps with the context, and it’s context that I’m struggling with. For a follow-up, Cities: Skylines 2 is basically good. I’ll even continue playing it, which isn’t that common after a review, especially for such a timesink. This time around, it has grabbed me, and yet it's such a small step forward that I don't feel entirely comfortable recommending it outright.

It's less about mere familiarity than you'd think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's "send a colony ship into space" ending could have asked "what if lasers and aliens", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?

In the technical world of city-builders, 2015’s Cities: Skylines made a name for itself as an uncompromising but delicate game where players needed to spin a variety of municipal plates to keep things in order across their fantasy cities. Eight years and millions of digital building permits later, Colossal Order has returned to construct a convincing sequel in Cities: Skylines II. The iterative additions don’t arrive without consequential imperfections, but Cities: Skylines II s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space Tales is a new real-time strategy game from Vietnam-based Saigon Dragon, who worked with Numantian Games to develop the brilliant They Are Billions. In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.

For our larger theme we discuss games that flip-reverse their theme when you least expect it, which is usually seemingly-cute games becoming horror - much like Harvest Island.
Plus: James gives us a rundown of fun games he tried at EGX, which sound very cool!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After busting down the castle door with their chaotic, siege-based citybuilder Diplomacy Is Not An Option last year, the last thing I expected to see next from developers Door 407 was a chill, meditative puzzle game that's just about, well, building tiny cities. In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.
This being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.

As first reported by PlayStation Lifestyle, someone asked Insomniac Games community director James Stevenson if New Game Plus and mission replay will be in the game at launch. Stevenson said, "No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1."

After someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. 
Someone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it "should be before end of year."

It's a roguelikelike deck-building strategy game where you draft units who drop onto a grid in random positions, enabling all sorts of abilities and combos depending on where they all land. It's kinda like the roguelikelike slot machine Luck Be A Landlord dressed for a Halloween party in a turn-based tactics costume. Million Monster Militia is ropey in its current early access stage, but I have enjoyed discovering weird builds and I am cautiously curious about its future after some updates.

After all, the flipside of the genre mantra of solving problems through imaginative application of the tools is that when you achieve a boring solution, that's all your fault. Did you miss the final jump while trying for a complex, third-storey infiltration in Deathloop, resulting in a sadly non-immersive firefight in the courtyard below? Did you fail to combo those magical abilities and terrain variables as the developers hoped - nay, dreamed you would, forcing you to rely on ye olde cover-shoot tactics to reach the checkpoint? Shame on you! Don't you know how much imsims cost to develop? Go back to Open-Ended Systems School and retake that course in The Power of Choice. Also, consider playing Mosa Lina instead.

It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.
For a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game "inspiring".

Newegg are currently offering a deal on Corsair's SF1000L, a compact 1000W 80+ Gold rated fully modular power supply - it's down to $150, from $180. 
That's still a lot, but this is quite a fair price for a 1kW PSU from a well-known manufacturer, let alone an SFX-L one as these are often more expensive due to their level of miniaturisation that is required. This basically allows you to use even the most energy-intensive CPUs or GPUs available*.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asus make some of the best gaming laptops going, and their Flow Z13 (discounted today!) is one of the most interesting too. It's an ultraportable 13-inch machine with high-end specs, a 1200p (1920x1200) 120Hz touchscreen and a detchable keyboard. Plug in Asus' discrete GPU (or any other eGPU solution), and you're left with an extremely powerful gaming machine - then unplug and you've got a thin and light laptop for getting work done or consuming media on the go. Nice. 
Anyway, this laptop retailed for $1300 when it first debuted last year, but now it's down to $700 at Woot in the US. That's a substantial savings and a good deal for a 13-inch laptop with a Core i5 12500H CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD.

That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. 
It was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney. What's more, it replicated not just the broader stroke that anyone can hear and go, "Oh, that sounds like Disney music," but instead created something wholly original that simultaneously sounded…]]></summary>

More details about the in-game events will arrive on October 30, according to Blizzard, but the content goes live for players on November 1. 
"We're extremely excited to be working with Le Sserafim for our game's first musical artist collaboration," Overwatch general manager Walter Kong writes in a press release. "Like the heroes of Overwatch, the Le Sserafim members are amazing as individuals, but unstoppable when they come together." 
Blizzard says Le Sserafim will also make an appearance at this year's BlizzCon on November 4 to perform "Perfect Night," as well as other songs, in the BlizzCon Arena following the conclusion of Community Night. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review and then read about the company's celebration of Overwatch 2's first anniversary. 
[Editor's Note: This story has been updated to clarify that Le Sserafim will perform "Perfect Night" during BlizzCon and other songs]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being as much of an insufferable, online-but-ultimately-in-quite-a-basic-way person as I am, I'm a Junji Ito girlie. The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status ("This is my hole! It was made for me!"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go "Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito."
This isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's rare that a developer explicitly introduces their game to you as "boring", and Indika seems anything but. Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a "very serious adventure game" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious "holy elder" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.
The game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a "fairy tale" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.

Wonder over the last couple of weeks (in addition to the hands-on I had as a part of our current cover story), and the review embargo has officially lifted. However, due to restrictive embargo guidelines that don't allow us to discuss large portions of the game, we have opted to hold our final review until the game is available for purchase. With that said, I did want to share some brief thoughts within the confines of the embargo.
I've loved my time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The game is aptly named for a title that instills a strong sense of wonder around every corner. Each stage introduces new gimmicks with appropriate and well-designed on-ramps, then expands on them in fun and unique ways. I truly never knew what I was getting into each …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two years after its initial reveal trailer, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is almost here. Due out October 20 exclusively on PlayStation 5, developer Insomniac Games' sequel to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a game we thoroughly enjoyed – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – and we're excited for others to play it. Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. 
More specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday. Digital owners don't need to worry about this as the patch will be installed as part of the pre-loaded version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

October 17, 2023
"The disc contains the entire game and is playable from start to finish with no patch or online requirement," Insomniac's statement reads. "But for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day – prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time. Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version." 
As for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Amnesia games are set decades apart, but they all begin in the same moment, a moment of waking that is also a moment of erasure and disconnection, a rebirth outside the flow of events from which to descend into the machine of history afresh. On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his "past self", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the "splendid architectures" below.
On 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.
Beware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If XCOM and Invisible, Inc. had a secret one-night stand in the back of a Cyberpunk 2077 taxi, the resulting lovechild would probably look a lot like Cyber Knights: Flashpoint. It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. 
There's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the glorious Xbox One years, when every Microsoft executive was engaged in the act of putting one foot in their mouth while shooting it simultaneously, there was a giddy period of marketing conducted by means of Phil Spencer's T-shirts. He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!


Sadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then. Speaking on the Xbox podcast last night (while sporting a boring Halo championship jacket), he suggested that Microsoft could do more to revive their older franchises. Or at least "revisit" them in some fashion.

But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.
Despite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves. MW3's beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there's definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.

That's according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.
It's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.

This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.

Stupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.

Or, you ignore all that, and treat the whole thing as an idle clicker, with no time limit and no real opportunity to fail.

Amongst other things, we can expect more robust search features, support for third-party subscriptions, better EGS launcher performance, a download manager with improved controls, and a new "for you" personalisation tab - all of that rolling out across 2024 and 2025.


Naturally, Epic will be continuing with their free games program through "2023 and beyond", and they've also put together a couple of special publishing offers for developers, Epic First Run and Now on Epic, which are designed to lure more studios from the amoeba-like embrace of Valve's gaming empire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alt Controller showing at EGX this year was properly top tier stuff. There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. 
Case in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.

While there’s no official word on a Spider-Man 2 PC version just yet, the appearance of previous PS5 exclusives over the last couple of years hopefully means it’s just a matter of time. The sooner, the better, based on what we’ve heard so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. 
Taking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection.

Wonder declared the series’ return to the 2D side-scrolling genre with a colorful bang. The game signals the return to Mario’s roots from a core gameplay perspective, but it’s more connected to Mario’s past than most people initially realized. While many remember the creative level design, expressive art style, and discovery of the game-changing Wonder Flowers, the most memorable moment came at the end of the announcement trailer, as everyone’s favorite plumber grabbed a never-before-seen item and transformed into an elephant. That moment told everyone that Super Mario Bros. Wonder, despite taking the series back to its 2D origins, is trying bold, new things unlike anything the franchise has seen before.

As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.
While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart serie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.


Moral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.

The memos and emails in question are from now-defunct US gun company Remington Arms, which was once part of the conglomerate Freedom Group. They've been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.

Made by the same team behind 2018's Project Hospital, Silence Of The Siren is an homage to Heroes Of Might And Magic where several different alien races are fighting to control a distant alien planet. It's a little bit 4X-y, but not massively so, and I had a very fun time indeed with its EGX demo over the weekend, which I think I played for almost a solid hour and completely forgot about the growing queue of folks behind me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Analogue Pocket is a retro handheld marvel, capable of playing your favorite Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its beautiful screen with modern sensibilities and technology – simply put, it's the best way to play a Game Boy game, assuming you can get your hands on the always-sold-out device. Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. 
Analogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:
An image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: 
Analogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have "4 original-style controller ports," presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed "us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes," and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. 
Analogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). 

While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review.

There are vacuum tubes mounted on one wall, doors to either side, and a ladder leading further down into darkness.
You click one of the doors and the perspective switches over slide-projector style to a second room with identical proportions. There are pipes emerging from the floor, here, and some kind of antique radio on a pedastel in the centre. Hang on, I know this place. I know this formless sense of dread. I know these machinations. The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate. This is Submachine, a 14-part escape puzzle series from Mateusz Skutnik, which Skutnik has now compiled, polished-up and re-released as Submachine: Legacy.

Being the sequel to two excellent games is not a guarantee of success. But it does set strong expectations. Thankfully, Spider-Man 2 meets and exceeds those expectations, providing uniformly stellar superhero action characterized by blazing-fast combat, smart mission design, and regular injections of thrilling set-pieces. Behind all that excitement, it also houses a fervent and heartfelt commentary on second chances, rehabilitation, and redemption. As a result, even in its dark moments, Spider-Man 2 delivers a wholesome and optimistic adventure rooted in j…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft update 1.21 has been revealed, and well, looks like Mojang have been reading my posts demanding the addition of a proper maze generator, those sneaky devils. As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.
The headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.

Endless Dungeon is a very splashy, confidently clever roguelike about spannering turrets, hosing bullets, and popping bugs like angry little pimples. It sounds disgusting when I type it out loud like that, so let's pivot to the reliable food analogy. It is a delicious game, a hearty stew. A tasty one-more-go-er, perfectly suited to serving up in these dreary autumn months. There. Now that you've been pacified by the imagery of a steaming bowl of pleasing dungeon gumbo, you will forgive the 400 words I have written below about doors.

Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit I've been a bit sceptical of Loco Motive since it was first announced a little while ago. Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.

Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.

This racing game, I’m told as I sit down to play a demo in the EGX 2023’s Rezzed Zone, cares about the person behind the wheel – and their burgeoning camaraderie with a roughneck pit crew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed in August that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario. Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani," Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!
October 13, 2023
Afghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder hits Switch exclusively on October 20. Ahead of its release, Mario graced the cover of the latest issue of Game Informer, and we've been diving deep into the making of the game and more in our exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder coverage hub. Here are some of the stories you can find in it:

Both offer co-op and competitive multiplayer options. Both deliver modernized visuals. And both give players new gameplay concepts and abilities that expand the original franchise vision in unprecedented ways. However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario's claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series' fates are forever intertwined.

There are 1,320 reviews at the time of writing, and they are Mostly Negative, which is quite the showing for a game's first day on sale.

This is an arcade blasting game through and through, where conscious strategy and placed shots soon shrink into rearview atoms as the pull of the machine gunner takes you and you realise you've been screaming for the last eight seconds. You drive a selection of vehicles across an increasingly ludicrous desert while everything in the universe tries to stop you. But you have guns. Or flamethrowers. That are bristling with ramming spikes. Or possibly all of the above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 out in the wild we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game in RGG Studio’s Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, Infinite Wealth, is a melting pot of old and new. As the bare buttocks of returning Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga indicated in the reveal trailer for Infinite Wealth, we’re not in Yokohama anymore, but Honolulu, Hawaii. He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. 
Alas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.

Earlier today, Microsoft officially acquired Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick revealed he will remain as CEO through the end of the year after Xbox head Phil Spencer asked him to stay to help with the company transition. While staying through the end of the year presumes Kotick will depart from the company in 2024, that remained technically unknown.
However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says that Kotick will depart from Activision Blizzard, a company he took over 33 years ago, on January 1, 2024.

One of Superstars’ biggest selling points is to take down Eggman with up to three other players. Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …]]></summary>

Earlier this morning, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority approved Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The CMA was the last hurdle for Microsoft's acquisition after it received approval in more than 40 countries and regions, including the U.S. earlier this summer. The deadline for Microsoft to close this deal was October 18, but reports indicated the company was planning to finalize it today, October 13. That has now happened, and Activision Blizzard is officially part of Xbox's first-party studio umbrella.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve are introducing text message verification for game developers using Steamworks, following what the platform-holders describe as a limited incident which saw hackers taking over several Steamworks accounts and adding malware to their games. Reportedly, fewer than 100 Steam players have been affected by the malware – I hope you’re not among them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm honestly a little surprised by how much I'm enjoying Star Trek: Infinite. It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. "Lets you play your own Star Trek story" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was mixed on Dambusters' Dead Island 2 - I thought the combat had flair but not much depth, loved the game's decadently disastrous Los Angeles, but hated how exploration boiled down to nosing around for crafting materials. The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a "surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape" in blissful Malibu.
There are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands. Here's a video of the opening.

Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. 
Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC last week and both critics and fans alike are quite happy with the series return to its roots. Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft's biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. 
Thank you all for joining us on Basim's journey in 9th Century Baghdad!

October 11, 2023
Alongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: 
479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad
60 million Leaps of Faith
1.2 million street cats pet
"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception," Ubisoft's statement reads. "We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


We had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review. If you're still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage tips and tricks. Read our interview with Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub after that.

Having founded it in 2006 in Osaka, Japan, later working on games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101, he left his reason for leaving up in the air. He simply said, "This came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs" and that he feels "this outcome is for the best." Now, just a few weeks later, Kamiya has started a YouTube channel – aptly called "Hideki Kamiya Channel" – and in his first video, he reveals he's not retiring, as first reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 


In the video, we see Kamiya presumably leaving his office with a box of knick-knacks and more in hand before leaving in a Lamborghini. In the first video, he talks about how he's currently unemployed, joking that peopl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. 
This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the "paragon of the future." The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a "deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces."


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive's scrapped version of Dead Island 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
