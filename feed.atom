This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD's Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[October 2019 saw the launch of action-platformer Valfaris, and now the sequel has a date. Side-scrolling shoot 'em up Valfaris: Mecha Therion is coming to PC on November 21, 2023, with consoles to follow later. 


Developer Steel Mantis is doing the best thing you can do to a protagonist with this one: Give them a massive robot. The story of Valfaris: Mecha Therion is pretty much covered in the subtitle. Therion continues his hunt for the evil Lord Vroll, only this time he takes the opportunity to bust out the secret weapon known as Mecha Therion. Thus, the follow-up is ready to fire away with a move from hectic, Contra-esque running and gunning to pure shooting action. 


You can see how they changed things as Therion suits up in the release date trailer:




If the mighty sword he wields wasn't enough of a hint, there are still melee moves to master. Mecha Therion has Melee, Ballistic, and Destroyer class weapons, and your loadout can be configured with a variety of weapon combinations. Further add-ons and weapon upgrades are acquired by earning Blood Metal. 


If the actual lore of Valfaris is something you can't resist, publisher Big Sugar Games promises a "deeper dive" in the days leading up to this month's launch. After its arrival on PC, Valfaris: Mecha Therion will make its way to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2024.

        <updated>2023-11-08T21:58:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gearbox Publishing celebrated 10 years of Risk of Rain today with an announcement for Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds, a free-to-play action RPG roguelike for mobile devices.


The game looks to bring the usual fast-paced, run-and-gun combat of Risk of Rain to a new perspective. Hostile Worlds uses an isometric camera to display the action. The mobile RPG also embraces the new changes visually, showcasing a more cartoon-ish style with chibi-esque Survivors and perhaps even animated cutscenes. Gearbox notes that Hostile Worlds includes a lot of familiar characters and foes while staying true to the series' lore.




Risk of Rain mobile charges into battle with more Survivors


Beyond the look and new angle, the big takeaway is that this mobile Risk of Rain will let you swap characters on the fly. The game lets you pick three Survivors you can change while in "mid-combat to exploit enemy vulnerabilities." It sounds like your odds of survival will only improve by unlocking the best Survivors who complement your team's playstyle. There will also be co-op support for you and up to three others. 


But even that might not help. The publisher promises that Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will still be pretty tough with "heart-pounding bullet-hell gameplay" and "colossal adversaries."





Naturally, since this is a F2P mobile game, there will be some live-service trappings. Neither Gearbox nor developer Frima Games makes mention of what their free-to-play model looks like yet. But the game will feature "continuous" updates to keep "the fun rolling." I expect we'll see new Survivors and items getting piped into some in-game store. Gearbox hasn't yet revealed any costs, and the game's release date is still up in the air.


There is a website, though, and signing up for the newsletter will unlock a Survivor called Mercenary during the game's launch. Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's nothing worse than swinging in New York City and having all that momentum slam to a halt after getting stuck in a wall. Thankfully, the latest update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 fixes some troublesome clipping issues and a bug that could corrupt your save file.


The latter issue is clearly the larger concern. Thankfully, according to the notes released by developer Insomniac Games, the bug appears only in a very specific situation. And there's only one such bug listed with the update. A majority of the fixes cover collision problems, getting stuck on objects, or clipping through or into things. For some, Spider-Man would warp through the ground like Nightcrawler and fall forever into the screaming void. The patch should hopefully fix it. Hopefully.

Spider-Man 2 update fixes the infamous 'Spider-Box' once again


The Spider-Man 2 update includes five fixes for clipping issues. It addresses situations where you can get stuck while running on a wall or clip through the world while in combat. There's also a fix for one issue that I had to deal with. While playing the Coney Island story mission, I had Peter Parker sit on a bench that must have been coated with glue. He wouldn't stand up, and I had to restart a checkpoint. If this happened to you, the update should fix it. 


The patch also corrects the model-loading issue, of which the character turns into a white box. And if you've checked the game's subreddit, the bug is not as uncommon as you'd think. It may have even happened once to yours truly. 


I had fun with it. Screenshot by Destructoid


There are other issues addressed by the update. Missions should no longer randomly fail if you have the HUD removed. The game should also count the number of correct flips if you're going for the Hang Ten trophy. Check out the full list to learn more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To encourage inactive players to return to Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix is hosting a Callback Campaign again. These occur now and again as an incentive for any who bounced off to return with encouragement from friends. This one begins today, November 8, and ends on December 14, 2023.


In FFXIV, Callback Campaigns work by having an active player invite a friend to return. These can be anyone from a free company or a player on the friends list. 


Assuming the invited player accepts the invitation and returns, both parties receive a few benefits. Players who send the invitation receive five Gold Chocobo Feathers. Players use these to obtain dyes and mounts like the dragon Twintania. 


Those who return to Eorzea play free for 14 days and also receive 99 Aetheryte Tickets for free fast travel. They also get 10 Silver Chocobo Feathers, which are good to exchange for two pieces of new gear. 


Some restrictions do apply. The most notable is that lapsed players need to be inactive for 90 days. Another is that players sending invitations can only receive their reward once, meaning even if multiple friends accept an invitation, the sender still only receives five Gold Chocobo Feathers. Square Enix even recommends participating in other programs to gain more feathers. 


For anyone who has an active FFXIV membership and wants an old friend to return, this could be a good incentive, especially with some additional rewards. Two free weeks to catch up with FFXIV's patch content also doesn't sound like a bad deal for lapsed players because while FFXIV is wonderful, subscription fees add up over time. 


It's why, despite loving the MMO, I haven't played for roughly two years. Hopefully, players like me who are invited use this as a perfect opportunity to jump in and squeeze all they can from the free weeks.

Everyone loves a good mystery, and even more so if they're the one who gets to solve it. The detective genre has evolved a great deal since its point-and-click adventure game roots, and this list proves how much things have changed. In fact, the games that we're including in this list range from typical noir detective fare to the kinds of games that you'll probably tell us "don't count as detective games" in the comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Update: The Pikachu Returns My Nintendo reward is now live, and it's 500 Platinum Points. You can find the listing for it here. The dimensions are 5’’ x 4’’, and according to Nintendo, it fits 16, 20 and 24 oz Cups.]


These days, if you take a short nap, you might miss a video game launch. I felt that way about Detective Pikachu Returns this week, and I'm one of the few who actually played the original (that's just how 2023 is going! It's an onslaught, folks). But even if you don't partake in the recently-released digital follow-up, you can still order a Pokemon-branded coffee cup cozy soon.


Image via Nintendo


My Nintendo just posted a hype blog for Detective Pikachu Returns, which includes details for Switch Online icons (which include a few general-purpose Pokemon avatars) and printable stationary/wallpapers, as well as a new My Nintendo physical reward: the aforementioned coffee cozy. It's yellow, it's cute, and it'll fit around a cup. You also get the satisfaction of knowing that it's not random big box store Pikachu merch, because this rat even has a hat; and there's magnifying glass/lightbulb imagery to let you know that the cozy is from Detective Pikachu.


Here are all the details we have from Nintendo:



"Everyone knows that Detective Pikachu loves coffee—now he can keep yours warm (or cold!) with this adorable Detective Pikachu Returns Cup Cozy. This physical reward is coming. Stay Tuned!"




As far as the My Nintendo storefront is concerned, "stay tuned" could mean anywhere from 1-7 days for the actual listing to pop up. While a Platinum Point price hasn't popped up yet, the lowest-cost comparable item in the store currently is 400p, so expect it to be in the 400-1000 range when it arrives.


If you need more platinum, we got you covered!

Even though Lords of the Fallen does have its fair share of faults, the game is a compelling experience for Soulslike fans, and the fact that the devs are looking to expand its many systems and features is bound to draw even more people in. Some of the key highlights include all-new armor sets and questlines, spells, events, fixes, inventory expansions, and more.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/timesplitters-developer-free-radical-could-reportedly-face-closure-by-embracer-group/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=timesplitters-developer-free-radical-could-reportedly-face-closure-by-embracer-group"/>
        <updated>2023-11-08T18:23:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citing sources close to the studio, Video Games Chronicle has reported that Timesplitters developer Free Radical is facing closure by Embracer Group.


The original Free Radical filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after the cancelation of Star Wars: Battlefront III and a failed bid at a Goldeneye 007 remake for Activision. The remains of the studio were bought up by Crytek, rebranded Crytek UK, and the staff went to support some of that developer’s games, such as the Crysis series and Warface. During this time, a lot of the staff reportedly left the studio. Most of the remaining staff was later transferred to Dambuster Studios under Deep Silver, where they worked on Homefront: The Revolution and Dead Island 2.


In 2021, Deep Silver (a subsidiary of Plaion and Embracer Group) reformed Free Radical with some of the key staff returning, including Steve Ellis and David Doak. The intention was for them to revive the Timesplitters series.


According to Video Games Chronicle, Embracer and Plaion “must consult employees for a minimum of 30 days before making any redundancies, including exploring ways of avoiding them.” This means that the studio could remain open, but as VGC initially reported, many key staff are currently looking for work.


If the closure of Free Radical goes through (and it looks like it will), this will be another in a long line of closures and layoffs for Embracer Group. This follows the loss of a potential $2 billion investment that reportedly fell through earlier this year. It’s been really painful to see so many losses due to the failures of an overly optimistic, expansion-hungry corporation.


Beyond Embracer Group, many other companies have been laying off huge portions of their staff, including Epic Games and Ubisoft. It’s not a fun time to be covering this industry, let alone working in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time when Valve could do no wrong, releasing hit game after hit game. While better known these days as the developer behind Steam, Gabe Newell and his crew got their start with the iconic Half-Life. Now, an update has been sighted, and the timing is quite suspicious.


According to SteamDB (as spotted by PCGamesN), the original Half-Life underwent a few changes days ago. Specifically, Valve added several depots, including one for Linux and macOS, as well as for some languages, such as Spanish, German, and Korean. 


Screenshot via Destructoid


There's also a "buildid" that's been added, which could be in reference to a new build of the game itself. Clicking on each depot reveals a list of files, but the majority of people probably won't be able to ascertain what a lot of it means (myself included). It's been years since the game's last update, but considering its age, there's probably not much to do. 


No, it's probably not Half-Life 3


Given that Half-Life is approaching its 25th anniversary, there's a possibility that Valve is getting ready to release an update for its maiden game. What that entails, we can't say at this stage.


We know that an RTX version of Half-Life 2 is in the works, so maybe the OG is getting similar treatment. Given its legendary status, the 1998 (November 19, to be specific) release has left quite the impact on the FPS genre, shaking things up a bit with its world building and environmental storytelling.


Hard to imagine that it's been around for nearly a quarter of a century. But it's definitely nice to see that it's still getting a lot of love and attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, we've seen plenty of crossovers with Dead by Daylight. Now it's Chucky's turn, as the latest reveal trailer shows the killer doll from the Child's Play films will make his way to Behaviour Interactive's asymmetrical horror title.


The trailer reveal comes courtesy of IGN, which states Chucky becomes another Dead by Daylight fixture on November 28. Suffice it to say, he'll be a playable Killer, in case anyone was wondering. It also appears as though you'll be able to customize the character "with the Good Gal outfit, inspired by Tiffany Valentine (aka the Bride of Chucky), which is voiced by Jennifer Tilly."




On top of that, actor Brad Dourif will reprise his role, because, quite frankly, is there anyone else up to the task? Sure, Mark Hamill did a passable job in the rebooted movie, but no one comes close to Dourif.


Probably won't be able to possess anyone, though


Some skills Chucky will possess include being able to sneak around the maps and the ability to "lunge at his larger would-be victims." He can also be assisted by the ghost of Charles Lee Ray, Chucky's human form, before his soul got transferred into the doll. Early patch notes for the game's PTB servers are already live, too. 


The brainchild of screenwriter Don Mancini, Child's Play brought the world the violent little doll with adorable dungarees and a penchant for murder. The franchise has enjoyed lucrative success over the years, albeit less so with subsequent entries.


As for Dead by Daylight, the survival horror game has certainly carved out a niche for itself by adding in monsters and characters from famous franchises. It'll be interesting to see whether they'll add Andy Barclay (the first Child's Play film) to counter Chucky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

Ingratiating yourself with each one by learning their ways is an important step in your journey to reclaim your Na’vi culture, as well as garnering enough support to push back against the exploitative mining of the villainous RDA.

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Movie Games and Vaporware have released the neon-soaked FPS Beyond Sunset into Steam Early Access today. It’s expected to stay there for six months before its full release.


Beyond Sunset is part of an oncoming wave of first-person shooters built in the GZDoom Engine (an expanded source port of the engine that 1993’s Doom was built on), including Supplice and Selaco. It bills itself as a cyberpunk shooter with “a rich story and RPG elements.” You play as a woman with incredible abilities and no memory. Another woman promises to give your memories back if you kick some ass.


I’m so tired of amnesiac protagonists. But aside from that, Beyond Sunset has lived on my wishlist for a while now, so I’m definitely going to check it out. It looks pretty fab with its lo-fi aesthetics injected with neon. I love raycasting. I deal with 3D constantly, and 2D games are rife in the indie and small-budget spheres, so I appreciate it when a game gives me 2.5D.




The RPG elements include side-quests and ability upgrades. It also features a soundtrack provided by Karl Vincent, who is touted as a “synthwave legend.” I’m going to have to take their word for it. Beyond Sunset also touts its modability, which I think is sort of a given considering its open-source engine.


Beyond Sunset is available now in Steam Early Access. Vaporware is planning to have its full release in six months. The Early Access FAQ states that the current state of the game is “mostly finished – only minor tweaks and polishes are left.”

According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It's been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Update: Rockstar's Sam Houser has confirmed that a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto game will be released in December. The original story follows after the below tweet.]




Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that a Grand Theft Auto 6 announcement could be coming as early as this week, according to his sources. 


Schreier's sources also tell him that a trailer is scheduled for December, to coincide with Rockstar's 25th anniversary. As one of the most anticipated games, anticipation is high for Rockstar to finally unveil the next chapter of the massive franchise.


For years there has been a flood of GTA 6 rumors, with nearly all proving to be false. However, due to Schreier's track record, this claim holds a little more weight. Schreier had also previously reported that the upcoming game will feature a Latina protagonist which aligned with what we eventually saw in the colossal 2022 leak.

The long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI


The gap between GTA 5 and its successor is the biggest in the franchise, with the game being originally released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013. During this time, it's had several re-releases, including a remaster for current-gen consoles. We got our first official mention of the successor in February 2022, and since then, reports from Schreier have claimed that we'll be heading back to Vice City in the next installment. 


It is hard to predict what the upcoming game will look and feel like, as there have been significant changes at Rockstar since GTA 5. Most notably, Dan Houser has left the studio, and there have also been reports of a cultural change at the studio as it aims to shed its old fratboy ways. 


Prior reports claim that the upcoming game could launch in 2025, though we will have to wait for official word from Rockstar before marking our calendars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashy façade.
Fashion Dreamer, the newest release from the developer (Syn Sophia) of the cult classic Style Savvy games, garnered high expectations from fans hoping to find a spiritual successor to the series. While Fashion Dreamer is not technically part of the Style Savvy family (known as 'Style Boutique' in Europe), it offers fans of those DS and 3DS games an opportunity to take their fashion expertise to Nintendo Switch.
Unfortunately, Fashion Dreamer’s gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. At the beginning, we are welcomed into a virtual world called Eve, where we play as an influencer putting together outfits for NPCs and even other players if utilizing the online mode. The majority of the game is spent creating outfits, called 'look-its,' for characters that are spaced out across a small map, called a 'cocoon.' Each character wants their outfit to meet specific criteria, like featuring a certain color, including a clothing item such as a jacket, or having a particular vibe such as being “cool” or “unique.”

Berzerk was a 1980 arcade title, which means it existed before good graphics were invented. While something like Pac-Man could generally be considered a better game, Berzerk had one thing going for it: the robots talked. They’d draw from a series of words and phrases that would get pasted together into taunts. Things like “Chicken! Fight like a robot!” or “Get the humanoid!” Imagination was leaned on to fill in a lot of graphical blanks in those days, and having the robots converse with each other and actively taunt the player really helped get you in the headspace.


If there are no robot voices, what are we even doing here?

The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you're a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you're doing here, and why everybody's so terrified of the sun. I haven't deciphered the mystery yet.

It comes as no massive shock given the success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, but the fact that this Zelda adaptation will be a live-action film project (as opposed to, say, an animated feature or a Limited Series) has provoked a variety of reactions around Nintendo Life Towers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Switch has had a long and successful lifespan, and Nintendo isn't ready to move on from the hybrid console just yet.


With over 130 million units of the console sold, it's understandable why the company would not want to step away so quickly. Nintendo notes that the Switch will turn 8 years old in March 2024, but this won't mark the end of the console's life. Instead, the company will continue to develop new titles for it without being bound by traditional platform cycles, according to Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa.


Compared to current-gen consoles, the Switch remains woefully underpowered. Despite this, it continues to sell like hotcakes, with it moving 132.46 million units globally. Furukawa's comments suggest that even if a Switch successor comes next year or in 2025, we'll still be getting games for the current hybrid console. 


There are a few ways to interpret the comments. They could be an indication that the next generation will live alongside the Switch. The comments also reveal that Nintendo believes the hybrid console has a lot more to give.


We also get some updates on some of Nintendo's most profitable franchises. Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold 4.3 million copies within two weeks of launch, making it the best-performing Super Mario title. The game has managed to reach these heights with some help from the Super Mario Bros. Movie which has boosted the IP's popularity.

For those who haven't squared off against this gas-masked psychic, one of his powers was the ability to read your memory card and make note of what you've been playing. This largely hinged on how many Konami games you had saved, but it was still wild at the time. Look, it was 1998, so having a character call out Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was more than enough to blow your mind. 


Psycho Mantis can name a small handful of games you've been playing. For those he doesn't mention by title, he'll say something generic like "You like action games!" Been jamming Azure Dreams or Suikoden? He'll hit you with the "You…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's that time of year again! The nominations reveal for The Game Awards, happening on December 7, will occur on Monday, November 13, with tickets available now.




According to Geoff's tweet, over 30 categories will be announced, including the highly-anticipated Game of the Year. This year has seen many acclaimed games, with titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kigndom, Baldur's Gate III, and Alan Wake 2 making big waves. Last year, the Game of the Year went to FromSoftware's Elden Ring. It'll be interesting to see what gets nominated this year, as well as what dark horses and snubs may appear, much like years past.


For those who want to experience the show in-person, tickets are now available for purchase. The event will take place at the Peacock Theater. Previous years had the show at Microsoft Theater, but no reason was given for the new location. Ticket prices range from $81 to $181, depending on where you choose to sit in the Orchestra section.


Starting in 2014, The Game Awards, created by Geoff Keighley, is in its 10th year. While the event did exist prior in the form of 2013's VGX and Spike Video Game Awards, the show was a little loose with its presentation. In years since, The Game Awards have become a bit more prestigious, and now loosely resembles other music and movie award shows. 


Still, expect many big announcements, much like years prior. Famous announcements in the past include Xbox Series X, Death Stranding 2, and Joker from Persona 5 in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revenant Hill, the next game by the makers of Night in the Woods, has been canceled. The reason is that the game's narrative designer and artist Scott Benson is battling a severe illness that has forced him to step away from the project.
Benson reveals on his personal X account that he’s been suffering severe heart failure over the past 12 months, which has greatly limited his ability to work. You can read his post below. 
So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn't go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I've had to stop working in the manner I once did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After nearly two years toiling away in the Early Access mines, developer Stray Bombay has announced that The Anacrusis officially launches this December. 


The Left 4 Dead-like has been tweaked and patched 53 times since it entered Early Access. More than a million players have tested the game and seem to like what they've experienced. The Anacrusis has managed to maintain a 'Mostly Positive' rating on Steam. It's a more optimistic response than other games that have aped the legendary zombie co-op game.

It's like Left 4 Dead with a retro vibe and aliens


In case you're not up to date and your eyes glossed over while reading the prior paragraph, The Anacrusis is a first-person co-op game akin to Left 4 Dead and Vermintide. The former makes sense as the studio was co-founded by Chet Faliszek, a former Valve writer who worked on the original L4D games. 


The Anacrusis doesn't shy away from its inspiration. Like L4D, a team of up to four players gets together to shoot their way through multiple stages. The game also includes an AI Director that keeps an eye on players and their progress, altering things like ammo or weapon spawns. If you're doing too well, then the Director may try to knock you down a peg.


The Anacrusis isn't a carbon copy of its spiritual predecessor, though. It rocks a retro '70s vibe and some kitschy flair with occasionally salmon-colored environments and weaponry. You also fight against hoards of aliens, as opposed to infected, taken, Ridden, or whatever the hell else we want to call zombies these days.

Considering its pedigree and the surrounding early praise, The Anacrusis may be the L4D-style game to try when it launches out of Early Access in December. The full version is available on the Steam Store on December 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ll be getting a deeper look at the future of Playdate in an upcoming live stream. The company announced that it will be hosting a 12 minute showcase via YouTube on November 8 at 9a.m. PST. 


The showcase is set to introduce developers working on the next slate of Playdate games and to offer some insight into “more fun stuff on the horizon.” In a follow-up message, Playdate teased what that fun stuff might look like. The company wrote, “No big hardware news, but keep an eye out for something blue & new.”

Save the date


Playdate was first announced back in 2019, and the little handheld console made its way into gamers' hands for the first time in April 2022. The console’s games follow a bit of a strange release schedule. The first “season” contains 24 different games, which become available two-per-week after you first get your device. Those are the flagship titles, and other games can be bought through Playdate's Catalog service or sideloaded onto the device.


Thanks in part to the handheld’s unique approach, Playdate has skyrocketed in popularity. A year after its launch Playdate had sold over 50,000 units. That’s more than double what developer Panic had projected and orders were backlogged into late 2023. Currently it’s possible to pre-order a Playdate for when the next batch of devices arrives. 


The November 8 showcase could shed some light on when Playdate will be more readily available. It will also finally give owners and people with a pre-order waiting in the wings a peek at what Playdate’s second season of games will look like.

Dubbed for the insignia Commander Shepard bears throughout their journey in the original trilogy, it's usually a day of celebrating the series and some news about future projects.


While the amount of news has varied over the years, BioWare has a new Mass Effect in the oven. So naturally, the developer revealed an ARG trail today that led to some cryptic teasers. The good news, is they're for the new Mass Effect. The less exciting news? They're pretty slim.


After the first two trailers, code-named Epsilon and Oculon, were revealed showing a mysterious figure in an N7 jacket walking, the Nebula trailer gave us a full-on view of our enigmatic strider. It is... someone wearing a helmet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has confirmed that it's working on a live-action film for The Legend of Zelda.


In a statement, Nintendo confirms the Zelda movie will be produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad, the chairman of Arad Productions.


Director Wes Ball has already been tapped to helm the project. Ball's previous work includes The Maze Runner theatrical adaptations, as well as the upcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.


The live-action Zelda film will be co-financed by Nintendo and Sony, with the former covering over half. Worldwide distribution will be handled by Sony Pictures Entertainment. And notably, Nintendo is developing the picture themselves.


"By producing visual contents of Nintendo IP by itself, Nintendo is creating new opportunities to have people from around the world to access the world of entertainment which Nintendo has built, through different means apart from its dedicated game consoles," reads today's statement.


Nintendo's cinematic universe


After the runaway success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, it was easy to speculate over which Nintendo property might see its next film adaptation. After all, video games are big in the adaptation field right now, whether it's on the silver screen or at-home streaming.


A live-action adaptation direction is an interesting one, though. The adventures of Link and Zelda certainly seem ripe for cinema. But whether this will be an adaptation of a game or, more likely, an amalgamation of ideas into a new-but-familiar narrative, remains to be seen.


Still, it somehow means that we are, indeed, getting a Legend of Zelda film. Let many months of speculation about who will play Link, and whether they will speak, commence.

        <updated>2023-11-07T20:00:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Remedy Entertainment dropped a new update for Alan Wake 2, one that should clear a few progress-halting issues some players are having. Oh, and apparently it fixes that one annoying problem that seemingly keeps coming back. 


The latest update is on the smaller side, but it's likely a welcome sight for anybody stuck due to a bug. Last week's update brought a whopping 200 improvements and fixes to the game, covering everything from lip-syncing to overall polish. However, there was one that came back — ironically enough, just like an echo. 





Latest Alan Wake 2 update fixes Hotel progress-halting issues again (maybe)


The last patch attempted to fix an Echo not aligning correctly in the Oceanview Hotel Lobby. Remedy itself called it "annoying" while issuing an apology. The bug has been a hard one to squash and is addressed once more in the new patch. Remedy writes that it was "fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted." 


Here are the patch notes via Remedy:



Xbox Series

A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.




ROOM 665

Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  




LOCAL GIRL

Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.





Hopefully, Remedy managed to slay the Echo dragon once and for all. Of course, we'll know for sure when the next update rolls our way.


Remedy is also working on an update that will add New Game Plus mode to Alan Wake 2. There is no solid release date for it, but the mode will add new Manuscript pages and video content to slightly alter the narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft will lay off 124 employees as part of a cost cutting strategy. These departures are happening across several of its departments, including many at its Canadian offices.


The layoffs are hitting a variety of departments at Ubisoft, including some administrative teams, Ubisoft IT, and Hybride, the company’s SFX studio. In a statement to Kotaku, the company explained the reasoning behind the move. 


“Ubisoft is proceeding with a collective dismissal in its Montreal establishment within the framework of a reorganization of its production support services across Canada, by consolidating these functions Canada wide, Ubisoft will be able to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.” 


The company also said it is “providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition” and emphasized that the current restructuring won’t have an effect on its production teams.

Déjà vu


Ubisoft as a whole has been facing challenges lately. Lengthy delays for games like Beyond Good and Evil 2 and xDefiant have undoubtedly affected the company. Just this May, Ubisoft let go dozens of employees at its North Carolina and Newcastle locations. Employees at the time said they were given no notice that they would be losing their jobs.


Sadly this is part of an ongoing trend in the gaming industry this year.  In September Epic Games cut 16% of its workforce. Just last month Naughty Dog and Telltale Games were hit by a wave of layoffs. More than a dozen different companies have faced layoffs in the back half of 2023 alone.

More specifically, subscribers will get access to the Crunchyroll Game Vault. Members will have access to the new feature starting today.




The vault is open


Crunchyroll plans to add new games to the library over time, but as of today, there are five launch titles. Here are the five launch titles:



Captain Velvet: The Jump+ Dimensions


River City Girls


Wolfstride


Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery


inbento



Unfortunately, it looks like for now only Android versions of the above games are available, though the press release indicated iOS versions are coming soon.



"Crunchyroll Game Vault is a curated, focused library of premium titles for the global anime fan that loves gaming, adding even more value to Crunchyroll memberships by connecting fans with anime-infused content. With Crunchroll Game Vault, we're also looking forward to working with international developers to bring their titles to mobile for the first time or introduce existing mobile games to the Crunchyroll community as part of an amazing line-up."
- Terry Li, Executive Vice President of Emerging Business at Crunchyroll



Crunchyroll is already essentially a much-have for Anime fans in America, so any additional value can probably be considered a win. I recently resubbed to check out a ton of the new shows that are starting up in recent and future months, so I'll probably check out some of the games on the vault as well.


The Crunchyroll Game Vault is available today for Crunchroll premium subscribers.

Revealed at Gamescom back in August and coming to Switch (and Steam) in 2024, Wild Country is described as "a cozy-competitive card game with city-building elements" by its developer, Lost Native.
The game involves constructing buildings for the critters of Big Sky County while collecting cards and engaging friends and/or family in a competitive game of strategy. The deck/city-building elements bring to mind classics like Slay the Spire and SimCity, and the emphasis on competition appears to add some humour and spice to the cosy aesthetic, something we've seen plenty of over the past few years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Glory Society posted an announcement on Twitter today stating that they have decided to “suspend operations” and that “this is the end of the development of Revenant Hill.”


According to the announcement, the team has disbanded after two members had to depart due to health reasons. Considering the small size of the team, the task of replacing even two members was too difficult. They also cite the “schedules, budgets, and fraught task of reworking the whole project” as reasons why the team has decided to call it quits.




Glory Society's Scott Benson, in a separate Tweet, has said that he has been diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely resulting from a virus, and that it will "greatly limit [him] for the foreseeable future."


The team was working on Revenant Hill. It was set to be a game about a cat trying to make ends meet at the edge of a graveyard. Notably, it involved the co-creators of Night in the Woods. The art style is pretty unmistakable. The game was shown off as part of the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase, but unfortunately, it sounds like it isn’t to be.


The Glory Society's announcement goes on to say that “after the dust has settled, perhaps we’ll talk about what we’ve made and learned together.”


Like most creative endeavors, game development requires a great deal of dedication and passion. Setbacks are the truest test of both those things, and overcoming them proves a lot more than any individual success. Hopefully, this isn’t the last we hear from the individual developers of The Glory Society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023's wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company's Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition," the company told both IGN and Kotaku. "We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams." Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to "to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term."
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Eclipse has announced via Twitter that they will reveal the next game in their Gold Master Series during the Day of the Devs The Game Awards Edition on December 6, 2023. This follows this year’s August release of The Making of Karateka.


The Making of Karateka feels like an evolution in re-releasing older games. While Karateka itself might be a tough sell in today’s market, Digital Eclipse contextualized it using a tonne of behind-the-scenes footage, documents, and interviews. With this added context, it’s a lot easier to appreciate the game in the spotlight. Beyond that, it also provides great insight into not just the rigors of game development but the business as it was at the time.




The Making of Karateka was advertised as the first in their Gold Master Series (though it followed the foundation they set with Atari 50). No other titles have been officially revealed. I can definitely think of more than a few that I’d like to learn more about.


The developer was recently acquired by Atari, who has seemingly pivoted to the business of game preservation and has suggested an eagerness to work with Digital Eclipse on similar projects. The chances that the subject this time will be a game from Atari’s history is definitely greater than zero. At the same time, it might not be.


We’ll have to wait and see at Day of the Devs The Game Awards Edition on December 6, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games is in court trying to prove that Google is running an illegal monopoly with their Google Play store. As part of the trial, Epic Games Store boss Steve Allison has admitted that the Epic Games Store is still not profitable, according to reporting by The Verge.


If this sounds extremely familiar, it’s because Epic tried to get a similar ruling against Apple. It went pretty poorly for them at that time. I guess all those layoffs the company performed freed up enough budget to pay their lawyers for another go. If at first you don’t succeed.


Speaking of not succeeding, the Epic Games Store doesn’t seem to be. We knew it wasn’t turning a profit from emails revealed in 2021. Part of this is because the company has been doling out money to try and secure exclusivity for certain titles and giving out others for free to try and drive adoption of the platform. More specifically, the leaked emails showed that Epic paid $146 million for Borderlands 3 to be exclusive to the platform.


To put it more into perspective, Epic thought if they gave out free games, secured exclusives, and gave developers a better share of the sales, they would be able to get people to adopt their platform and secure 50% of the PC market. They previously said they expected to start bringing in an annual profit by 2023. Four years later, that strategy still hasn’t worked. Meanwhile, this past September, they laid off 16% of their workforce. When that fails, I suppose the next logical step is to sue your way to success. We’ll see how that works out for them this time.


The Epic Games Store launched in December 2018. It is still not profitable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Apple's key selling points of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are the devices' ability to play some pretty modern and demanding games. One of which is the recent Resident Evil 4 remake, and it's launching on compatible iOS devices soon.


Capcom announced that the Resident Evil 4 remake will be coming to the iPhone 15 Pro on December 20. It will also be available for iPad and Mac devices with the M1 chip or later on the same day.







The Ada Wong-focused DLC, Separate Ways, launches alongside the core game. It features additional content that resolves around "a secret mission that expands on the adventure and features thrilling new game mechanics."


The preorder available now enables a demo of Resident Evil 4. It showcases the beginning of Leon Kennedy's otherworldly endeavors, and gives you a feel for how the game works on mobile devices. You can play via the device's touchscreen or with compatible bluetooth controllers. It's also cross-platform playable with a single purchase so you can easily transfer play across your iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, or Mac. The latter of which offers keyboard and mouse controls. 


Resident Evil 4 isn't the only prominent console title heading towards mobile. Ubisoft also confirmed it will be bringin Assassin's Creed Mirage to iOS platforms. And Capcom's Resident Evil Village launched for the aforementioned Apple devices on October 30. 


Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village, and Assassin's Creed Mirage are all landing on modern iOS devices without the need for cloud support. It's a pretty incredible time for mobile phone gaming. If you're hesitant, don't be. Resident Evil 4's remake earned a good score when it rolled out for consoles and PC in March. As did the Separated Ways DLC, which actually scored a bit better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Hook Studios revealed the first DLC for Darkest Dungeon 2 as The Binding Blade. The new DLC will feature a handful of new features including two new playable heroes with their own unique trinkets, signature items, fully-voiced backstories, and a new roaming mini-boss.




Two new heroes have entered the fray


The new DLC will feature two new playable heroes: The Duelist and The Crusader. The Duelist has the ability to switch between Defensive and Aggressive stances while also ignoring enemy defenses and countering attacks with Riposte. She also has the ability to reduce cooldowns and provide offensive and defensive buffs for her team.


The Crusader is a popular hero from the original Darkest Dungeon who is returning for the sequel. The Crusader is a front-line hero with the ability to tank damage while supporting his team with healing and stress recovery.


Both heroes have their own fully voiced backstories including playable flashback encounters that players can explore. Each hero also has their own trinkets and signature items that players can use to specialize them even further.


A new roaming mini-boss called The Warlord will also make an appearance in The Binding Blade DLC. No further details were provided, but I'm all for new bosses.


I played a good bit of Darkest Dungeon 2 when it entered its Early Access stage but just haven't had the time to jump back in since it was fully released. This DLC seems like as good a time as any to jump back into the madness.


Darkest Dungeon 2: The Binding Blade releases this December on both the Epic Games Store and Steam.

The word "anacrusis" refers to a set of syllables that precede the first metrical foot in a line of poetry - an intriguing moniker for a game that is essentially Valve's Left 4 Dead, but set in a 1970s-styled high tech facility reminiscent of No One Lives Forever. I'll be honest, I haven't been keeping up with The Anacrusis, and assumed that it was one of those top-drawer philosophical puzzlers. Come on, there isn't even a pun in the title!

Rumours of the Switch successor are hotting up by the day, though Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa seems keen to challenge the accuracy of the claims (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
In a recent financial call, the contents of which were written up on the Japanese site Mainichi, Furukawa dug into some of the latest 'Switch 2' discussions. Speaking to the claim that Nintendo's follow-up console was showcased behind closed doors at this year's Gamescom event, the company president stated, "The rumors online that appear to be public information are not accurate". (according to Simon Griffin and SatsumaFS' translation for Nintendo Everything).

For decades now, Nintendo has fostered a family-friendly image that has made the brand a firm favourite with gamers both young and young at heart. It would be hard to argue that Switch isn't the family console to own, given its colourful library of top-tier software and the convenient way the hybrid handheld system slots into family life.
However, along with all the excellent Everyone-rated games, Switch's popularity has attracted developers of M-rated titles, too, and the catalogue of adult-only Switch games is also enormous. And since Nintendo Life is now 18 years old(!), what better way to celebrate adulthood than with a selection of amazing games we can finally play now we're all grown up?

Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.]]></summary>

Ah wait, jewel in the crown! - is new 64-player map The Reclamation of Montcrux, in which the rampaging Agathians attempt to overrun a fort held by the Tenosians, pitting petard against bombard, battering ram against ballista. 


Gosh, that's a lot of medieval words. The translation is that one side has to run up the hill screaming while the other side lobs big balls of fire at them. Bash your way into the castle and you'll be able to stop the aforesaid rain of fireballs, though you'll still have to worry about getting dinged upside the headbone by dudes in plate. Onward, friends to the next paragraph! We have nothing to lose but our limbs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early on in The Talos Principle 2, one of your soon-to-be robot pals says to you with a completely straight face, "We're here to solve this puzzle, not to discuss philosophy." I can almost see Croteam's writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot's eyes. You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. 
Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn't without its faults, it's a more-than-worthy follow-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen, the spiritual successor to 2014's Soulslike with the same name, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last month – you can read Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review here. After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a "regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience." 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says "players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community." 
"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community," studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. "We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries."
For more, read Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review and then listen to us talk about it on The Game Informer Show.

Just two years after the release of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, the Nicktoons have been thrust together once again in the name of licensed platform fighting, of all things, in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. The original was a solid outing with deep mechanics, but was held back by a lack of polish outside of gameplay, and although history isn’t exactly repeating itself with the sequel, it certainly rhymes.
Anyone familiar with the first game will immediately notice something different about the fighters, they all feel a lot heavier. Rather than zipping around at lightning speed, each and every character has been slowed down considerably, giving more weight to each movement, but also a bizarre floatiness in the air with serious momentum on the ground.

Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it's one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.


Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that's everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here. 
For more, read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review and then check out this update where Remedy discusses its development progress on Control 2 and its Max Payne remakes. After that, read this feature about the characters to remember before starting Alan Wake 2, and then check out what the best graphics modes are in the game.

It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Laid-off Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and Mass Effect developers are attempting to turn this year's "N7 Day" of Mass Effect-themed festivities into a day of mass revolt. The developers in question are a mixture of former full-time staff and former Keywords Studios QA testers who have worked on Dreadwolf under contract. They've organised pickets outside BioWare Edmonton's offices in Canada, and are calling on BioWare fans to get involved on social media, while trying to engage current BioWare staff in conversation about unionisation.

Publisher QuByte Interactive has released the launch trailer for its upcoming 'horror life-sim' Bem Feito, launching on the Switch this week on November 9th, 2023.
The trailer evokes commercials from the '80s and '90s, featuring atmospheric clips, a soothing voiceover, and an appropriate CRT filter to make things look extra authentic. It's certainly a weird one, we'll give it that.

Nintendo has today published its financial report for Q2 FY2024 and it looks like things have been going really rather well. On top of some meaty sales figures for the likes of Tears of the Kingdom, Pikmin 4 and the Switch console itself, the report finds that Nintendo's sales in the first half of the fiscal year have been "the largest since the launch of Nintendo Switch".
Comprising sales from hardware, software and other "mobile, IP related income" like The Super Mario Bros. Movie, apps and the like, Nintendo's ¥796.2 billion sales from Q1-Q2 this fiscal year have trumped all other first-half earnings from the Switch's lifetime — which, when you consider that this console is knocking on its seventh anniversary, isn't bad going.

Nintendo has announced that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has now sold 19.50 million units, just shy of that 20 million milestone.
Launched on May 12th, 2023, the game has now effectively sold nearly two-thirds of what Breath of the Wild has managed in the space of about five months or so. That's insane. For the sake of clarity, Breath of the Wild is now sitting at 32.85 million units.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-06T19:20:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. "Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary," a press release reads. "Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu." 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class "never seen before in the Diablo universe." 
And that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

As it turns out, with the old map and items came a whole lot of players, setting a new all-time concurrent player record for the multiplayer shooter that surpasses even its previous heights in the pop-culture zeitgeist.

        <updated>2023-11-06T18:38:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. "Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power," Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here's a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review. 
Which of these heroes are you most excited about? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

This "multi-year co-development partnership" will "build a powerful toolkit that harnesses artificial intelligence to enrich the narrative and character creation elements of game development", according to Inworld CEO Ilya Gelfenbeyn. You might recognise Inworld as the tech used by that GTA 5 mod about AI cultists in which characters speak AI-generated dialogue, which Rockstar blocked from distribution over the summer. Suffice to say that Microsoft have grander plans for it.

        <updated>2023-11-06T17:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

Since then though, it's become a game where I don't so much build a single mega-city as a series of experiments.
Naturally, those experiments devolved from a noble effort to remove the stain of cars into a sadistic urge to drive thousands of my own people on a never-ending hell march.

In the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2021, Twitter user Thomas Violence, an Australian podcaster who was working in a bar at the time, recounted that a 19-year-old had asked for a refund on their drink because they realised they were too drunk already. One of the early replies was an "ummm actually," pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded "I'm one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that's not America". I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach "Zach Gage" Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I've played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

        <updated>2023-11-06T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game's development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world," Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. "There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity."
Watch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. "Violence Is Inevitable" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games launched Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017 and if you followed the game back then, you likely know that every other week, there was news that Fortnite had its biggest day ever in terms of player count and other impressive metrics. Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite's history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn't list a specific reason but it's pretty clear it's because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer's breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite's Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

What's clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank. Now it's getting a re-release in just ten days and I'm fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.

"The objective is to run over babies in your minivan while shooting cops and other players. It's taking over the dark web... and IRL."
You don't need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

But what if instead of trudging around a grey cave, you were driving a big drilling machine instead? It's so simple, and yet it makes all the difference in GeoDepths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

        <id>121449</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025"/>
        <updated>2023-11-03T12:02:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great," Mazin told Deadline. "[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff."
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

While it's technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1's past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.


But such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.

I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.
I want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest. If I hadn't played The Tartarus Key already I'd be playing that, is what I'm saying. But the other day I played the demo for An English Haunting and it's exactly what I want. It's just not going to be out for a while. Rats!

The cleanest summary I can manage is that developer Genvid and publisher Konami have launched a very bad streaming service dedicated to dunking on Silent Hill, with microtransaction-fuelled voting mechanics and a chatbox awash with 10 years of pent-up fan resentment and confusing references to James Sunderland's genitals.

We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow "THE KING FISH" for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.


Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth?

It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it.

I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.
Using a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.

But it ends this week, with Epic bringing players back to the Chapter 1 map for the next season of Chapter 4. Thanks to a new trailer released today, we know this throwback season is called Season OG, is a part of Chapter 4, and will be bringing with it a heavy dose of nostalgia.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a "talk" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled "Guerilla", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.

November 2, 2023
Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. 

Yet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means.

        <updated>2023-11-02T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game Informer can exclusively reveal Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex, a new graphic novel from Dark Horse Books that brings players back into the world of assassin Eivor, a medieval Nordic land, a new hidden order, and more. It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. 
The Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents "blackened by a language he innately understands." 
"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen," a press release reads. "An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?"
Ubisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book.

The most significant additions  are accessibility settings for colour-blind people, the ability to visually customise hirelings upon recruitment, and the ability to clean up party members using sponges and soap, rather than lobbing bottles of water at them. No more rocking up to cutscenes looking like Sweeney Todd on his lunchbreak! Well, unless that's your vibe.

Mafia II: Definitive Edition
This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

This leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it's normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles.

Plus, we talk about games we've been playing recently, which includes Alan Wake 2. Alice does an unhinged rant while unaware she is once again ravaged by Covid.


This is why episode 35 is coming out a week after it was supposed to: yes, I had coronavirus the entire time! Apologies for the delay. But, you know, not like loads, I was pretty sick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer's block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. 
Alan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 and quickly became Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – players have discovered bugs and issues leading to laughter and, in some cases, progress impediment. Fortunately, developer Insomniac Games has been quick to fix issues with updates, like one last week that fixed an incorrect flag and the infamous white cube model issue. 
Now, the studio has released another update targeting various bugs players might be encountering in the game related to specific missions, shortcuts, tutorials, and more. 


Here's the full Update Version 1.001.004 release notes: 
Addressed an issue where players could become stuck during the finale of Marko's Memories
Addressed an issue where a boss could become stuck in geometry
Addressed multiple issues where the player could become stuck during the Galvanize tutorial
Addressed an issue where players with shortcuts enabled could become stuck in a puzzle during the New Threads mission
Addressed an issue where the Charge Jump would break when assigned to a shortcut
Addressed an issue where the Upgraded Classic suit had duplicate eye details
Further addressed issues where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Improved stability 
Hopefully, if one of these issues has stopped you from progressing past certain points in Marvel's Spider-Man 2's various quests, you'll be able to advance after installing this update. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about how Insomniac updated New York City for the sequel. Then check out this story about this missing NYC landmark in the game. After that, read our guide for the best graphics mode in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and then check out our spoiler-free tips.

        <updated>2023-11-01T14:48:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7 is getting its biggest update tomorrow in the form of Spec II (a.k.a update 1.40). The content drop, which is free, adds a new cooperative mode, seven new cars, a fresh track, and more.


Perhaps the update’s biggest addition is four-player local split-screen. Unfortunately for PS4 players, this option is only available on PS5. Speaking of PS5-only features, those players can enjoy taking on Gran Turismo Sophy, which developer Polyphony Digital describes as a “prototype revolutionary racing AI agent” 
Spec II also adds the snowy Lake Louise track. Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.
Of course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:
Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi '68
Dodge Challenger SRT Demon '18
Lexus LFA '10
Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II '91
NISMO 400R '95
Porsche 911 GT3 RS (992) '22
Tesla Model 3 Performance '23
Spec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website. You can download the update on November 2. For more on Gran Turismo 7, check out our review.]]></summary>

Ever since its first title 20 years ago, the WarioWare franchise has shapeshifted to take advantage of the capabilities and gimmicks of whatever the current Nintendo platform was. But the first entry on Switch, Get It Together, bucked that trend, putting you in control of the actual cast of characters in platforming-style microgames instead of taking advantage of the Switch’s unique traits. WarioWare: Move It aligns more with the traditional WarioWare experience, resulting in a better overall collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled Sonic Dream Team, a new 3D action-platformer launching exclusively on December 5 on Apple Arcade. With it launching on Apple Arcade, you'll need to subscribe to the iOS-based gaming subscription service, which costs $6.99 a month. Dr. Eggman has discovered The Reverie, a special ancient device that can manifest dreams in the real world, and it's up to Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to stop him from doing so. Players must navigate "twisted dreamscapes, rescue your friends, and put a stop to Dr. Eggman's nightmarish dreams of world domination." 
Sonic Dream Team features six playable characters in Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Cream, and Rouge, and Sega says each character brings their own flair and personality alongside three movement types "that provide unique exploration opportunities while navigating the dream world." It also features four boss battles, never-before-seen worlds spread across "four unique dream worlds with mind-bending environments that include wall-running, gravity changes, and more." Plus, Sonic Dream Team can be played on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. 
Check out the Sonic Dream Team reveal trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some Sonic Dream Team screenshots too:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beware major plot spoilers for the entire Amnesia series, together with descriptions of fictional torturing techniques.

The most ghoulish of Amnesia's many ghoulish ideas is "vitae". It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly? Agony.

Choi began the video thanking players for helping the game sell 1 million copies in less than two months after release. He then sneakily drops a line confirming the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike is getting a sequel.

Mind you, it appears the associated functionality was secretly part of Bethesda's sci-fi RPG all along, perhaps destined to be unlocked by a DLC pack, like a slumbering fairytale royal awaiting true love's kiss.
The modder in question is vexthecollector, whose catchily-named Spacestations for Outposts lets you bolt together hab modules, windows and docking bays to fashion your very own Deep Space Nine. Sadly for my character, the acutely terra-phobic star pirate Mary Read, you'll need to first build an outpost on a planet in order to access the goods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Headless enemies aren't exactly a new concept in games, so I'm not sure why the Headless in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice instills such dread in me. It's so terrifying to face that I almost didn't write this post, because I knew I'd have to drop into its heinous lair in order to take the screenshot you see above.
But I'm a brave boy, so I dropped in, and of course died almost instantly. Sekiro is still one of the toughest soulslikes around, absolutely filled with extremely dangerous bosses and twisted body-horror monstrosities that can carve you up with just a couple of hits, sending you back to the last checkpoint bereft of all your XP. But the Headless scares me so much, I actively avoid facing it until I have absolutely no choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is all show, no tell, which is a bold swing. Video game characters aren't often big on show don't tell in 2023. A lot of them have been cursed by their creators to narrate everything they do, as they do it, incase the meatsacks controlling them are unable to parse even one second of what is happening on screen without direction. I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.
In contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little knowledge can be worse than no knowledge at all. I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019's turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.


It sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.

And yet! That's a large part of what I enjoy about the new subterranean survival-craft-'em-up The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria. It's a slower, more weighty survival game than you might be used to if you're a Valheim or ARK type, for example, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the dark. But what is this, a survival game for elves? No sir. And besides, like I said, it's rather sweet. Cosy, even.
