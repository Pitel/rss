Frey Holland, voiced by actress Ella Balinska (Charlie’s Angels), is the lead protagonist of Forspoken. For the most part, Frey is an ordinary young woman, but when she mysteriously gets transporte…]]></summary>

Escape rooms have become increasingly popular over the last decade, but not everyone has one in their area or the time/friends to complete one. Escape Academy brings the concept home as a co-op puzzler.
Revealed during today’s ID@Xbox showcase, the game comes from publisher iam8bit Presents and tasks players, either alone or with one other partner, to become the ultimate escape artist by unraveling a variety of puzzling locations under a time limit. The reveal trailer shows off locations such as a “mundane” office rapidly filling with gas to something as elaborate as an American Ninja Warrior-esque obstacle arena. Since you control a student attending an escape room-centric academy, you can explore the puzzle-laden campus and meet its colorful faculty members. Co-op is both local and online, with the trailer showing off split-screen gameplay.

With Arceus Legends and the surprise announcement of the late-2022 Scarlet/Violet versions, it’s easy to forget that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl launched last Fall and are still going strong. The Sinnoh region remakes are teeming with content for its dedicated trainers, from special Easter eggs to other fun, miscellaneous gifts. Yesterday, a new Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl update followed suit, enabling trade with strangers. Moreover, two Mythical Pokémon can be encountered and caught for any players looking to fill out their ever-expanding Pokédex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to "a niche of freaks". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.
When I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. "It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away," he says. "Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you."

With Fire Emblem: Three Houses selling well on Switch, and thanks to the series' heavy presence in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the Fire Emblem franchise has never been in such a good place. It probably makes sense, then, that this new range of plushies has appeared to melt our hearts – and our wallets.
All the toys below are expected to ship on 30th June and are available with worldwide shipping from PlayAsia. If you're wanting to grab one (or ten), you'll want to be fast; PlayAsia notes that "item availability is not guaranteed" after 20th March, meaning you only have a few days to secure a pre-order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clink your wine glass. Tunic is not so much a love letter to Zelda as it is a wedding speech. Many games pay their respects to the blonde lawn mower and his absentee princess, but few have such fondness and understanding of the exact feelings those adventures conjure up, the precise sensation of exploring, the nook-scavenging, and the meticulous internal mapping that happens when you play Zelda's brand of wundergame. Tunic might have sacrificed some of its own identity in hitting every Ocarina note so perfectly, but when the result is such a capable homage it's hard to complain.

Tunic brilliantly captures the feeling of that special childhood title that made you fall in love with video games. Using a virtual simulation of an old-school guidebook, the game masterfully balances telling players almost nothing with giving them all the information they need. The result is a game brimming with genuine, triumphant discovery.
With its every pixel stuffed with reverence for gaming as a medium, Tunic revels in its historically inspired design. Players steeped in the hobby’s traditions will find following their instincts richly rewarding as they quest…]]></summary>

Naoki Ikushima burst onto the scene in 2018 with the release of Square Enix's HD-2D turn-based love letter to classic RPGs, Octopath Traveler. His gorgeous, painterly art perfectly suits the diorama-style environments and pixel-perfect characters. Since then, he's stuck with producer Tomoya Asano to work on Bravely Default II and the latest game from the famous Square Enix producer, Triangle Strategy.
Nintendo of Europe brought this gorgeous video, which was published last week, to our attention via Twitter. In the video, Ikushima draws the strategy RPG's protagonist Serenoa Wolffort and his betrothed, Frederica Aesfrost, standing atop a cliff and staring into the distance. The "sketch", as the video puts it, is nothing short of stunning:

Digimon Survive has been floating around the digital ether for a few years now, and while there’s still no release date in sight, a new teaser trailer introduces us to the cast. 
Though the video premiered earlier this month during Digmon Con, today’s trailer is an English version of it. Digimon Survive is a tactical RPG that stars Takuma Momozuka, a student who gets transported to the Digital World during a school camping trip. He befriends fan-favorite Digimon, Agumon, and sets out to save the world from danger. He’s not alone though. A party of fellow youngsters and their respective Digimon partners accompany Takuma and Agumon, who you can meet in the trailer below.

Digimon Survive’s battle system consists of turn-based strategy on grid-based playing fields. Outside of combat, you’ll engage in choice-driven gameplay that leads to multiple endings, and the storytelling unfolds through a blend of visual novel-style conversations and fully animated cutscenes. 
It’s good to see even small glimpses of Digimon Survive (which was originally slated to launch in 2019) and hopefully, we’ll finally get to play it sometime this year. You can find the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Publisher:

Developer:

Release:
                      	November 11, 2022
			
            
Bethesda released the second episode of its Into the Starfield series today. The developer diaries provide glimpses into the game’s development with discussions from the designers about what the game entails while sprinkling concept art and even some light game footage. 
You can catch the first episode of Into the Starfield here. This second installment sees game director Todd Howard sit down with design director Emil Pagliarulo, lead quest designer Will Shen, and lead artist Istvan Pely to discuss Starfield’s open-world design and how it gives players the freedom to carve their own path. Accomplishing that relies in part on how players can interact with the game’s factions as well as individuals, with the team chatting up Starfield’s more sophisticated persuasion system. Check out the full video below.

Bethesda has slowly rolled out information on Starfield over the last several months, but a gameplay trailer remains elusive. If you haven’t been keeping up, Bethesda has thus far divulged details of Starfield’s lore and backstory and shown off a few locations. All of that has been helpful, but we’re anxious to see how it all comes together in-game. 
Starfield launches November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and launches day one on Game Pass.]]></summary>

The world is a dangerous place. One minute you’re out in your fields, farming to provide food for yourself and your wife, and the next you’re being accosted by a gang of monster girls who are dead set on stealing you away for themselves. That’s the fate of poor Fernando, who gets himself snatched away from his bed in the middle of the night. It is up to his loyal and incredibly protective wife, Mia, to rescue him.
She is his wife, and this is her quest, hence the name of the game. Wife Quest doesn't want you to take its premise seriously. Ignore the fact that Fernando appears to be the only man in the entire nation. Don’t worry about the death and destruction that Mia leaves in her wake as she attempts to rescue him, despite being repeatedly assured that he is in no real danger. Wife Quest is not trying to be serious, and it makes that clear from the start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has revealed that it will not be holding its usual EA Play Live event this year, which is traditionally an event the company uses to reveal new games and share more info about existing games, typically held during the summer. 
This news comes by way of IGN, which reports that rather than hosting an EA Play Live event like in previous summers, the publisher will instead reveal more about its projects “when the time is right for each of them.” Here’s what an EA representative told IGN in a statement sent to the publication: 
EA Play Live events have basically become EA’s own E3-like showcase, with the publisher even opting to hold it usually around the same time as E3. It’s been doing EA Play Live since 2016. Before the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the event was a live in-person event where players could play things shown during the showcase and more. However, as a result of the pandemic, the event became a steaming one, akin to something like a Nintendo Direct or PlayStation State of Play. 
This news comes just a few months after word that E3 would not be held as in-person event this year dropped. However, Geoff Keighley’s own E3-like event, Summer Games Fest, is happening this year as usual. 
While waiting to see what EA shows throughout the year, check out the latest footage of its Dead Space remake. Read about how EA pledged total freedom to its studios with game development, including Dragon Age, Titanfall, and more last year after that.

Tencent has been consistently making headlines in recent months with its continuing expansion in the gaming industry through acquisitions and investments. Recent acquisitions include the developer behind Ninjala, and it also confirmed a minority shareholding in Playtonic Games last November. Those are just recent examples, while Tencent is also notably partnered with Nintendo for Switch distribution in China and developed Pokémon Unite.
Its latest acquisition is Tequila Works, the Madrid-based studio that's perhaps best-known for RiME. In terms of Switch games the company is also known for The Sexy Brutale, while it's also working on the rather promising Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new meaning for the term 'Mobile Suit'.
Cases for the Nintendo Switch aren't a new phenomenon. Given that the device is portable in nature, it stands to reason that plenty of cases are available – especially with the Switch being five years old now – and we've seen a wide variety of different options, too. Some cases merely prevent damage during transit, while others bolt onto the console itself to offer that extra layer of protection. There are also options that include internal batteries, shifting the focus from protection to stamina.
The Plenbo G-Case does all of these things, and a little more besides. It's a modular offering that not only includes an internal (and swappable) 5000mAh battery pack but also includes its own kickstand, Joy-Con holder and customisable grips. Oh, and it has its own Bluetooth 5.0 transmitter which allows you to pair two sets of wireless headphones, as well as its own dock for charging and TV play.

Of course, there's one very famous goal celebration, and of course it's Waluigi's. Hey, we love him too, and his signature, ahem, crotch chop lit Waluigi fans' world on fire.

Elden Ring has been out for just 20 days and already, it’s sold a meteoric 12 million copies, making it the best-selling From Software Soulsborne game yet. 
Comparatively, Dark Souls 3 took a couple of months to sell 3 million copies and even years later, as of 2020, it has sold 10 million. That Elden Ring surpassed Dark Souls 3’s sales (as of 2020) in less than three weeks is quite the feat. This news comes by way of a new press release From Software released, praising the game for selling 1 million of those 12 million just inside of Japan.

Considering the latest game from the makers of Dark Souls launched less than three weeks ago, it's an impressive big number indeed. They also mention plans for "more of Elden Ring as an IP [. . .] in hopes of expanding beyond the realm of games," which I guess could mean anything from a novelisation to hats.

With renewed interest in the Mario football game series, GameXplain recently spoke to Mike Inglehart, formerly of Next Level Games — the studio behind the excellent soccer franchise, along with Punch-Out!! and Luigi's Mansion 3. While the full interview hasn't been published yet, the snippets we have seen give us a brief behind-the-curtain look at the original Super Mario Strikers on GameCube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like devlogs, those scrappy blogs where game creators crack open the egg of videogames to show you the yolk of development. The mistakes, the dead ends, the iterations; they illuminate the hardships of creation, and they're entertaining to boot.

I like dogs, too. I wrote as much when writing about the horrific rectangular dogmorphs of a particular devlog - doglog? levdog? - back in 2016. Those early GIFs would become Wobbledogs, a pet simulation in which you breed mutant dogs. It has now left early access.

Traditionally, some of the companies involved bring some sort of news or update for their ongoing products or upcoming projects. Whether it be new character DLC plans being announced, the first look at a trailer, or plans for additional tournament support, these roundtables have provided something to get excited about in fighting games.

PlatinumGames first foray into making a live service is otherwise a mess, with repetitive missions, dull combat, confusing stats and loot, and more problems besides.

Publishers and co-developers Square Enix aren't giving up, however. They've launched a survey asking how they can deliver a "better game experience", but it's the graphics they're focused on.

Over the past two decades, Rockstar Games has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the games industry. Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.
With all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell. Read more...]]></summary>

Ghostwire: Tokyo launches in just over a week, and PlayStation 5 players will have a lot to consider in terms of getting the most out of the spooky experience. That’s because the game sports not one, not two, but six graphical and performance options.
We’re reviewing Ghostwire: Tokyo and have listed each mode along with their in-game explanation. However, the game only lays out what the two primary modes do, which are:  
Quality Mode: A high-fidelity rendering mode with ray tracing enabled. 30 FPS limit
Performance Mode: A high-framerate mode designed for the smoothest gameplay. 60 FPS limit.
Additionally, a category labeled HFR (High Framerate) is described as having "an uncapped framerate and tweaks to graphic quality that allow for an even higher-framerate experience." It contains four options without descriptions, but Video Games Chronicle expounded on these which we’ve shared below:
High Framerate Quality: Quality mode with an uncapped framerate between 30-50 FPS.
High Framerate Performance: Performance mode with uncapped framerate over 60 FPS.
High Framerate Quality (VSync): Same as High Framerate Quality but with Vsync enabled. 
High Framerate Performance (VSync): Same as High Framerate Performance but with Vsync enabled.
Games with multiple graphical/performance options have become the norm in recent years, but Ghostwire: Tokyo may take the cake, and figuring out which one is “best” will depend on several factors (such as your monitor) as well as personal preference. 
Ghostwire: Tokyo launches March 25 on PlayStation 5 and PC. You can watch us tour its haunted streets in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

GhostWire Tokyo, one of our most anticipated horror games of 2022, is incredibly stylish. Developer Tango Gameworks' open-world environments are as ambitious as they are unsettling, as twisting hallways and shifting rooms give way to dreadful encounters with Yōkai – wayward spirits inspired by Japanese folklore. In this episode of New Gameplay Today, I sit down with Blake Hester to share our preview impressions from the second chapter of GhostWire Tokyo. We're accompanied by footage from my hands-on gameplay session, which I captured via PS5 performance mode.

Halo: The Series is set to premiere on Paramount+ next week, on March 24, and to prepare viewers for the journey ahead, a new two-minute trailer has been released. 
The trailer features voice-over by multiple characters we’ll likely learn more about in the series, including what sounds like Dr. Halsey and others. It, of course, features plenty of the Covenant, including an Elite with a sword, and a handful of very-cool Master Chief moments.

As you can see in the trailer above, the narration that plays over it is all about the costs of protecting what’s sacred. As for what “sacred” is, it’s likely different for everyone involved. For Master Chief? It’s completing the mission, whatever it is. Like the trailers before this one, the series is looking great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to watch it because it begins streaming on Paramount+ next week. 
In the meantime, watch the first teaser released for Halo: The Series and then read about how it’s already been renewed for a second season. You can also read about the decision to reveal Master Chief's face in the show.

The second batch of Xbox Game Pass games for March has been revealed. Weird West leads the pack as a very promising supernatural western twin-stick shooter from some of the minds behind the Dishonored series. Shedders is a radical snowboarding game you may remember from Xbox’s E3 presentation last summer. Crusader Kings III is bringing its medieval simulator wackiness to consoles for the first time as well. You can read our reviews for applicable titles to help decide whether or not a game is for you.

Developer:
      Capcom
      
Release:
                      	March 26, 2021
			(Switch), 	January 12, 2022
			(PC)
            
In a presentation this morning, Capcom revealed plenty of new details on the upcoming Monster Hunter Rise expansion Sunbreak, including the announcement of its release date.
Sunbreak, an expansion Capcom has repeatedly described as being "massive," will release on June 30 for both Nintendo Switch and PC. The digital edition of the DLC will be available for preorder today, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealed. Along with the base edition of Sunbreak, existing Monster Hunter Rise players will have the option to purchase a deluxe edition, which comes with additional cosmetics like Layered Armod, hairstyles, poses, and gestures. Preordering will net hunters a pair of adorable Palamute and Palico Layered Armor that make the animal companions look closer to their real-world pet counterparts.
Those who are new to Monster Hunter Rise, but want the whole experience when Sunbreak releases can purchase the Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak Set which bundles the full base game and the expansion together into one tidy package.
Announced to be released alongside Sunbreak is a new trio of Monster Hunter Amiibos. The set of three includes new Elder Dragon Malzeno and a Palamute and Palico each donning armor based on Malzeno. Using these Amiibos with the Switch version will grant players new Formal Dragon Layered Armor to use in-game.
A patch will be coming for all Monster Hunter Rise players on June 30 regardless of Sunbreak ownership status. The update will require about 13GB of storage space and will accommodate for weapon balance changes and new content coming to the game with the release of Sunbreak. This patch will be required for online play moving forward.
If you're interested in trying out Monster Hunter Rise with Sunbreak looming on the horizon, Nintendo is offering a free trial for Switch Online subscribers this week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re unfamiliar with Redout, it’s an anti-gravity racer inspired by the likes of F-Zero and Wipeout. And if you’ve not played any of those before, then imagine a pod-racer from Star Wars belting it down Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road - except, hang on, there’s a mysterious white powder caked on the bristles of Mario’s mustache. The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.
Redout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. "There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game," says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as "phenomenally unsuccessful".
This led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. "We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots," he says. "So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First unveiled last week, Ship Of Fools is an upcoming seafaring roguelite where you and a fellow co-op pal take on hordes of horrible beasties as you sail the high seas. Depending on your choice of player two, it's also likely to be an apt description of how you'll feel playing it.
Having waded through an early preview build of its opening Forgotten Waters stage this week, this is one co-operative cannon fest that seems destined to see friends and family not so much walk the plank after an untimely defeat as get absolutely spanked by it. Imagine the visual chaos of a game like Overcooked combined with the frantic, tactile ship management of Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime and you're pretty much there, albeit with several more barnacles, bug-spewing mosquitoes and laser-firing totem poles in the mix. The jangle of Davy Jones' locker is never far away in this storm-stricken archipelago, so beware, fools. You will not be suffered gladly.

        PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC
				
Publisher:
      Square Enix
			
Developer:
      Platinum Games
      
Release:

Babylon’s Fall, the latest from PlatinumGames and Square Enix, did not pan out well critically, with a 42% on Metacritic for PlayStation 5 versions and an even lower 37% on Metacritic for PC. 
It’s one of PlatinumGames’ worst-reviewed titles ever, but it seems Square Enix isn’t ready to give up on the live-service title just yet. That’s because the publisher has reportedly sent out surveys to players asking them how the game can be improved, as reported by Eurogamer. More specifically, the survey recently sent out is all about the graphics and visuals of Babylon’s Fall, and finding a way to “bring everyone an even better game experience.” 
Eurogamer reports that the survey asks players about their thoughts on the visuals of characters, equipment, NPCs, enemies, locales, battle effects, the UI, and the overall oil painting “brushwork” art style of Babylon’s Fall. The survey concludes by asking survey-takers what specific element of Babylon’s Fall’s visuals would need to be changed before they’d consider recommending the game to someone else. 
However, as anyone who’s played Babylon’s Fall or has read reviews for it know, there are multiple problems beyond the visual elements that make it hard to recommend. Perhaps Square Enix will canvass players about all of the elements viewed more negatively in the game and then fix each one so that with all of the fixes together, people might be able to recommend the game to someone. That remains to be seen, of course. 
If you’re curious about checking the game out yourself, you can do so thanks to a free PlayStation demo for Babylon’s Fall that’s available right now. For more info about the game, check out Game Informer’s Babylon’s Fall hub.

(Sidebar: having recently conducted an inventory of all my posessions for international shipping purposes, it appears the PS5 is literally the most valuable thing I own. I am 32 years old). I'm not very good at it, to be honest, so recently knocked it down to easy difficulty in order to stomp on robot heads with greater efficiency. Good ol' Aloy.
Anyway, now that I have awakened a sort of mother-surrogate AI and started the actual business of saving the world, I cannot help but ask the key question: why can I still not ride into battle atop a massive great robot T-Rex?

The Rune Factory series, a spin-off of Story of Seasons, combines action/RPG combat with its sibling’s farming and social elements. Now, almost a decade after Rune Factory 4’s debut on 3DS, a new Rune Factory game is just around the corner as a Switch exclusive on March 22. We chatted with director Shiro Maekawa to give you an idea of what you can expect, from the fun festivals to powering up Link Attacks with other town members.  
It’s been a long road to Rune Factory 5. Many fans were worried about the series’ future, especially with Neverland closing. Can you discuss the journey to get this long-awaited entry off the ground?

Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine.

Forspoken, the upcoming title from Luminous Productions and this month’s cover story, largely takes place in the magical world of Athia. Unfortunately, the realm has seen better days, as a creeping corruption has flooded the once-prosperous land. The Break, as the destructive fog is known in the game, has the power to corrupt anything it touches. Humans become hostile and mindless, animals morph into monsters, and even the land itself takes on a bizarre appearance.
While there have been several trailers for Forspoken, much of them take place in a dry, desert-looking region. This land is just outside Cipal, the last d…]]></summary>

Here’s a roundup of all the studios that won, and their winning title, in each category:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can’t get enough of everyone’s favorite blue blur, or Tails and Knuckles, as they’re depicted in Paramount Pictures’ movies, then we have some good news for you: there’s a “pre-quill” comic book for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 coming out later this month. 
As reported by Sonic Stadium, this prequel comic will lead into Sonic the Hedgehog 2 before it hits theaters on April 8 and part of it will be helmed by the movie’s own Dr. Robotnik, Jim Carrey. That’s because the comic book isn’t one big story but rather, five stories about different characters from the movie spread across 40 pages. One of these five stories will be centered on Dr. Robotnik and according to Sonic Stadium, Carrey is “spearheading” it. 
However, it’s important to note that Carrey does not have a writer’s credit in the comic solicitation so it’s likely that he simply helped out with the narrative, or shared ideas with the comic’s writer, Keil Phegley. 
“Catch up with Sonic and friends, if you can, in this exclusive prequel to 2022’s most anticipated family film,” the comic book’s solicitation reads, according to Sonic Stadium. “Life is good in Green Hills for Sonic the Hedgehog…maybe too good. He’s starting to get bored, and when Sonic gets bored, things become a lot less boring for everyone else – fast. Quicker than you can say, ‘Chili Dog,’ the Fastest Thing Alive is saving the day and causing all sorts of chaos along the way. Plus, new and returning characters starring in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 film take the lead in stories of their own.” 
For more about Sonic, check out this awesome poster for the movie, and then watch the final trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released today. Read about Sonic Frontiers, which drops the blue blur into his first open-world game, after that.

System Shock 3 has quite the troubled development history, chronicled in Part 3 of Game Informer’s Games Stuck In Development Hell feature, and it seems the game has been pushed even deeper into development hell. 
In a new interview with VentureBeat, Deux Ex creator Warren Spector gave what sounds like will be his final comments in regards to System Shock 3, especially now that his studio, OtherSide Entertainment, is working on a new IP. When asked if OtherSide Entertainment’s work on the threequel had come to an end, Spector said there’s not much more clarification he can give at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a YouTube channel I’m fond of called Virtual Japan, where a 4K camera serenely glides through gorgeous Japanese hotspots: Sapporo in the snow, Christmas lights in Tokyo, residential back streets in the pouring rain. You hear nothing but ambient city sounds and the tromping of a cameraman's feet. You could be watching a HUD-free FPS, albeit with incredi-graphics. Finally, in Ghostwire: Tokyo, someone has made a game of it, albeit with occasional ghost zapping.

Hogwarts Legacy, the mysterious and long-awaited RPG set in the Harry Potter universe, will finally get its first gameplay showing in a new State of Play airing this week. 
PlayStation tweeted the news this morning stating that the presentation airs Thursday, March 17 at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. There’s no word on how long it will be, but the tweet refers to it as an “extended look,” so that hopefully means we’re in for a deep dive on everything Hogwarts Legacy entails.

March 14, 2022
Hogwarts Legacy was first announced during the PlayStation 5 showcase in 2020. The open-world action RPG casts you in the role of a Hogwarts student and is being developed by Avalanche Software. Author J.K. Rowling has not been directly involved in the game’s development, which had been a concern to some fans in the wake of her controversial statements regarding the transgender community in recent years. Hogwarts Legacy was initially scheduled to launch in 2021, but in January of that year, it was delayed to 2022. 
Although Hogwarts Legacy has mainly been shown on PlayStation stages and is coming to PS5 and PS4, it’s also launching on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

Publisher:
      Nintendo
			
Developer:
      Sora, Ltd
      
Release:
                      	December 7, 2018
			
            
Masahiro Sakurai, the famed director behind Nintendo’s mega-hit Super Smash Bros. franchise, is back from a long break after completing development on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, it seems. And while he’s back to work, a new statement from the director teases that what he’s working on might not be a video game. 
News of Sakurai’s return to work comes from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo, which reports that Sakurai has revealed that he is, in fact, working on something. As for what, we might find out in the near future but Sakurai hints that it might not be related to gaming in any way. 
“I have been away for a while now, but I am working on something,” Sakurai told Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo. “My eyes may be a little tired. You may see me in the near future in a place that has nothing to do with game production. You may or may not be able to see me. I hope to see you again in the future. Thank you very much for your time.” 
As you can see in the statement above, Sakurai seems to be dropping hints to his fans that they shouldn’t be expecting a new game from him anytime soon. Perhaps he’s working on something that’s very behind-the-scenes, or maybe he’s jumped industries and is now working in movie production or something like that. Only time will tell. 
For now, read about Sakurai’s journey to get Sora from Kingdom Hearts, the final fighter in Ultimate, in the game, and then check out this story about how Sakurai isn’t thinking about a sequel to Ultimate but won’t rule one out despite that. Read about how Sakurai thinks the next game in the Smash Bros. series would need a smaller roster and less dependence on his own vision after that.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 hits theaters in just a few weeks, on April 8, and today, Paramount Pictures has released the final trailer for the sequel. 
If you’ve been watching the trailers for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as of late, then you know Paramount and Sega are unsurprisingly pushing the return of Robotnik and the introduction of Tails and Knuckles to the fray. Also, unsurprisingly, Robotnik, Tails, Knuckles, and of course, Sonic look great in this final trailer.

Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is right around the corner, hitting PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 25, and we now know it will launch with full crossplay support across each of these platforms. 
Gearbox Software’s own Randy Pitchford revealed the news with a tweet thanking the engineers behind Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands for making crossplay happen. He draws specific attention to Sony and PlayStation, which isn’t necessarily surprising given that between it, Xbox, and PC, it’s usually PlayStation that is void of crossplay with other plat…]]></summary>

Even if you love Final Fantasy games, expect to feel like a stranger in a strange land when playing Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. This violent retelling of the original Final Fantasy game from 1987 largely sidesteps the series’ adventurous spirit and heartfelt mysticism to focus on muscle, attitude, and everything extreme. Square Enix labels this remake as a “hardcore action/RPG,” an apt description for a game that rarely relents in its aggression. When swords are drawn and giant beasts enter frenzied states, this edgy exp…]]></summary>

In listing out the status of their own games, Microsoft say that Psyconauts 2 is "Verified" - meaning it's fully supported - while Sea Of Thieves is merely "playable" and Halo Infinite isn't supported at all due to its anti-cheat.

Hopefully those games will be better supported in future, but, Microsoft say, "It's up to our studios how they fit Steam Deck integration for their games into their busy schedules."

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Season 3 officially comes to a close with our discussion of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. 
Released August 22, 2017 – less than a year after Uncharted 4 – Lost Legacy puts Chloe Frazer in the starring role for the first time. She's not alone, however; former antagonist Nadine Ross partners with her, leading to an odd-couple-style treasure hunt that may be shorter than Uncharted 4 but was just as entertaining. Prior to this, Naughty Dog batted around other combinations of characters for this adventure including Sully and Sam Drake. How did the team turn The Lost Legacy around so quickly after A Thief's End? What's the deal with that "wimpy" train explosion? Listen here to hear the answers to these questions and more. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), and former Game Informer intern O'Dell Harmon Jr. (@ODellHarmonJr) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Uncharted game to date. Tune to also find out the game series that will be the topic for Season 4! 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

This week's episode is hitting a little later than usual. The reason? Our local comic shops in Minnesota didn't get any Marvel comic books last week. We felt the show would be a little light without them, so we held off until we could get our hands on those books. The wait was worth it: The first issue of Strange is an absolute delight and a fantastic direction for the Sorcerer Supreme to go in.
Most of this episode is dedicated to new comic book releases that hit this week and last. We also dive into The Batman, which I give a score and review to, and also discuss Gotham Knights' new release date!

From Panel to Podcast is a weekly show created by two lifelong comic book readers who offer suggestions on which comic books you should be reading each week. Each episode also dives into the latest developments for comics in video games, movies, and television shows. We'll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.

WWE 2K22 launches today. For some fans, the best part of wrestling games is creating custom superstars or, better yet, real-life wrestlers not present in the game (or at least not yet in some cases). But no matter how visually accurate your Jon Moxley CAW is, he’s nothing without an entrance that at least comes close to emulating the real thing. Thankfully, WWE 2K22’s entrance creation features a number of animations from old stars and even those who have never stepped foot in WWE. The trick is knowing where to look. 
WWE games have traditionally labeled these entranc…]]></summary>

Forspoken is a story-heavy game with the narrative mainly tying into the central quest. But Forspoken is not a linear game, and with such a vast, open world, we wondered what happens if you step off the golden path. To satisfy our curiosity, we recently sat down with developer Luminous Productions and got our first look at the game’s various side activities and optional objectives you can find around the map. Besides seeing more of the magical parkour in action and noticing the plethora of crafting materials lying around the realm, the team walked us through crafting in Refuges, enhancing stats at Monuments, finding …]]></summary>

EA has released a new two-minute look at gameplay from its upcoming Dead Space Remake and it features a quick look at Isaac Clarke laying waste to a Necromorph. 
Revealed today during a special Dead Space Remake developer update stream focused on the title’s audio, this look at gameplay showcased a small snippet of protagonist Isaac walking around a very spooky section of the Ishimura before he’s attacked by a Necromorph. Fortunately, he has his newly-remade 211-V Plasma Cutter.

WWE 2K22’s long road to release stands as a redemption story as dramatic as any of the TV storylines. The series took a few years off to regroup following the trainwreck that was 2019’s 2K20, and the time away allowed it to learn some useful new holds. Though it doesn’t catapult the franchise to bold new heights, a revamped gameplay engine and a renewed focus on approachability make it the most entertaining – and most of all, playable – WWE game in some time.
The new engine strips away some of the complicated mechanics that made the pre…]]></summary>

In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.
I don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.

Elden Ring is a hard game. It’s a From Software Soulsborne game so that’s no surprise. Be it a mouse and keyboard or a controller, bosses like Godrick the Grafted will undoubtedly give you some trouble in Elden Ring. 
Now, imagine fighting Godrick with some bananas. Like real edible bananas that you can find at any grocery store. Sounds impossible, right? Well, somehow it’s not because SuperLouis_64 on Twitter recently posted a video showing him do just that, as reported by Eurogamer. 
THE BANANA CONTROLLER WORKS 🍌
#ELDENRING pic.twitter.com/ZOjzYb8Sgo
March 8, 2022
As you can see in the video above, SuperLouis_64 plays Elden Ring with bananas as well as some of us do on intended controllers (better than me, at least – I’ll be honest). He seems to be using bananas on the bottom left to control his Tarnished’s movement while his right hand seems to use three bananas to control attacks and dodges. Of course, this is pure speculation because the official Banana control scheme for Elden Ring has not yet been released by From Software (we eagerly await the day, though). 
News of SuperLouis_64 tropical feat comes just days after someone beat Elden Ring in under three hours without dying a singe time. In other news, I am not as good at Elden Ring as I thought I was, it seems. 
If you need help in Elden Ring, Game Informer has you covered, though. Check out our guide on how to beat Godrick the Grafted and then read our guide on Elden Ring’s best rune farming location. After that, check out this guide on how to find Elden Ring’s best summon spirit, and then read about this tactic that will help you easily beat every boss in Elden Ring.

Another month, another roundup of U.S. NPD numbers and not surprisingly, Elden Ring was the best-selling game of February. 
Elden Ring is also the best-selling game of 2022 year-to-date and what’s more is that it is secured the second-best launch month sales of any title in the past 12 months, coming in second only to last November’s Call of Duty: Vanguard. On top of that, after just one month on the U.S. video game market, Elden Ring is already ranked as the fifth best-selling game over the past year. It ranked first on both Xbox consoles and PC, coming in second on PlayStation hardware.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aztech is a superb name for a game, and almost makes describing its premise redundant. Throwing in that it's from the same developers who made Mulaka meant I had to give it a go.
I'm glad I did. Aztech No Colon Forgotten Gods starts with its weaker foot, showing rough edges right away, but that’s overshadowed by its entertaining movement system.

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have gathered up some crucial Windows drivers for the Steam Deck, improving performance for those who want to ditch the default SteamOS and replace it with Windows 10. GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers are all available from Steam Support, so early Deck adopters looking for a change can get the requisite downloads all in one place.


These drivers come with caveats, mind. Audio drivers are still a work in progress, so only USB-C, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth headphones can output sound on Windows, and Valve’s post explains that dual-booting support still isn’t ready yet. Installing Windows, then, is an all-or-nothing switch that involves wiping SteamOS entirely.

Their 'updated' version was worse than the 1995 original, with blurry sprites, ugly menus, an incongruous font, and other problems. But they fixed it up a lot with patches, and now, almost four years since the last patch, they've applied a fresh coat of polish with another welcome update.

Shadows Of Forbidden Gods is different. It's all about building the power of your evil god under the radar until it's too late for anyone to defeat you. The more I've played it, the more I start to suspect that this concept will always suffer from being gamed by player who'll seek the most efficient paths. Any system of influencing and manipulating characters will necessarily be abstracted, and at some point subtlety becomes just another numerical value.


I suppose what I'm saying is that SOFG is more fun if you revel in scheming and causing chaos, and given the choice between effective and interesting, will always do the right thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all about our favourite mounts in video games - as in, animals that carry you around in games. Not cars. Machines don't count as mounts, I think we can all pre-agree on that. We discuss a lot of different horses, and some things that are not horses, from a bunch of different games. This is an unfortunate crossover with our 'best horses' special, which I forgot we had done. Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.
There are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks. This week's Cavern of Lies is WoW-themed, and if you'd like to listen along to Latvia's Eurovision entry this year then here's the link. Be warned that it is NSFW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social media sucks doesn't it? You sign up for a feed of dross that never stops, like you've paid for a rotten Fruit Winder that simply won't stop unwinding. Others who've bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.
Admittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great. Invading other worlds is a more interactive way of making friends and/or enemies too – it's perfect.

After a swim I'd stare longingly at the snacks I couldn't afford then stand on tip-toes before the game I couldn't afford to play, waggling a joystick and mashing buttons to pretend I was controlling the attract mode demo. Appealing to this sort of nostalgia, Konami have announced they're releasing a collection of 13 vintage Ninja Turtles games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article contains spoilers for Lost Ark's main questline.


Lost Ark is a very silly game, but not in the way it initially seems. For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.


This begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like "Tortoise", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.

With the right tools, then, you can plug into a monitor, add a mouse and keyboard, and get playing as if it were a (somewhat) conventional gaming rig. But how well does the Steam Deck work as a desktop PC, really? Valve’s use of the Linux-based SteamOS alone makes it less of a 1:1 equivalent to a Windows system, and its AMD APU was designed to handle the onboard display’s 1280x800 resolution – not 1080p and above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Valhalla enters its endgame phase with its final DLC Dawn Of Ragnarök, the very concept for which is kind of a big honking spoiler, so consider yourself forewarned.
The series as a whole is still electing to carry on with that subplot about super-advanced precursor god-people, like a chill friend who you ask to party knowing that they will, univited, bring along their mate who is really into a specific genre of sci-fi and will not stop derailing conversations to talk about it. In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heardle maintains many of the hallmarks of Wordle: it offers just one test a day; it's the same for everyone; and you've got six guesses to get it right. The twist is that you're trying to identify a song, with each guess revealing an extra few seconds from the opening bars. It's got me in its (melodic) hooks - and you can play it in your browser now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure how I feel about the term "boomer shooter". Given that it refers to new first-person shooters which evoke games from the '90s, shouldn't they be millenial shooters? Fresh from killing napkins and mayonnaise, here come millenials to kill Shub-Niggurath.

This is clearly me fighting a losing semantic battle, but in any case, Humble's Boomer Shooters Bundle has a lot of great games, including Dusk, Amid Evil, Ion Fury, HROT, and more for £9.05/$12.

It's delightful, and after a year on Epic's game store, the Epic Games Store, it's available on Steam.

The next brutal gauntlet is Disgaea 6 Complete, with a newly announced released date of June 28th. There's also a new character trailer below, which sets out its stall. Can you survive it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Built by two longtime RTS fans, The Fertile Crescent rekindles the age-old torch of elaborate strategy titles. Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.


Developers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”

Since the game's release, the player messages have taken on a different complexion. Before, I trusted in our small community trying its best to get by. Now I must treat every message with caution as they fight amongst themselves. The world is awash with trolls and their terrible craic, but I'm not sure I'd have it any other way.

But when she said she wanted me to do the first one, and that the first GOTY awarded on RPS was 2007's Portal, I almost laughed. Does Portal hold up? Why even bother asking? Shut this whole article down. Of course it holds up. It's Portal.
Of course, conventional bait-and-switch writing would dictate that this is the point where I tell you that, aha, after playing Portal again in the blinding light of 2022 it's actually a heap of rubbish, such as could only otherwise be found on the streets on day ten of a two week bin-lorry strike. But obviously that is not the case, because we're talking about Portal. If anything it's even better than I remember. Like. It's fuckin' Portal.

Blimps is an odd game. At a glance, it looks like an Elite-esque trading game, but it's more like... well. It's more like a game from the time before genres. A confusing, poorly explained time that mostly produced rubbish but occasionally produced a strange little gem like this.


You run a little airship business, on paper. In practice, your job is to figure out how to make enough money to get out. Ideally within an hour.

I'm thinking that Halo 3 "Believe" one that featured a cool diorama, or Gears Of War teaming up with Gary Jules for an emotional rendition of Mad World. We just aren't treated to the same level of grandeur nowadays. A few frames, Guns N' Roses, "RATED M FOR MATURE". That's our lot.
But Thailand clearly puts out good video game adverts. One of note features Elden Ring, a family, a strange trumpet noise, and a story as complex and obtuse as FromSoft's offerings. Give it a watch below, you won't be disappointed. More confused and emotional, perhaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Elden Ring was first thrust out into the world back in 2019, I have to admit I was pretty nonplussed about it. I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.
I'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before. And I think it's to do with Elden Ring's plentiful supply of save points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 might be the first GPU to benefit, in a roundabout way, from the bonkers price gouging that’s been spoiling the fun of graphics cards for nearly two years. In normal times, it wouldn’t make much sense to buy this £239 / $249 GPU – not because it’s the lowest in the RTX range, but because the much more powerful RTX 3060 would only cost a few notes more.


And yet, these are not normal times. While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK. And while it’s ultimately still a 1080p specialist, the RTX 3050 takes a big step up from previous GTX XX50 GPUs by offering DLSS and ray tracing support.

This is a studio that knows how to craft one-off stories filled with flashy combat, humour, and emotional gut-punches.
But the game is also Platinum's first foray into the dreaded minefield of live service and it's... not good. Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could've been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don't mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh. The story is meh. And it's all yours for £60 - heh?!

Others are born as side characters to lighten the story because the main dudes frown too much and Derek from market research says frowns are "cringe". Well, shut up, Derek. You're cringe.
