        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The game formerly known as We Are OFK
You might remember a certain indie-pop miniseries game called We Are OFK, which started in August 2022 and released episodes up through Sept. 8. OFK is getting a rebrand today, as the developer is changing the name of its episodic adventure to Pop. Love. Panic! The OFK Story.
Announced in a post today from the group's Twitter account, the band announces that its origin story game has a new name.
"We feel #PopLovePanic fits our story better!" said the band. "'We Are OFK' had a 'If You Know You Know' vibe, and we wanna be better about reaching out to people who haven’t already heard of our band."
The name change coincides with a sale on Steam, where you can get the full run of Pop. Love. Panic! for 30% off at the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu2iKC4fVDs
What's in a name?
Though it sounds strange, changing the name of a game isn't as uncommon an experience as you'd think. I started back-searching instances in which this has happened, and found plenty of recent examples. Inti Creates retitled Grim Guardians to Gal Guardians in March, and Ubisoft changed Gods & Monsters to Immortals: Fenyx Rising prior to its release. That's not even accounting for the differences in titles between regions, like how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios is now doing away with the Western Yakuza moniker and unifying the series under Like a Dragon.
As for OFK and Pop. Love. Panic! The OFK Story, I hope the rebrand works well. We Are OFK has been on my backlog since reviews seemed warm on it. Though some were confused by the concept—an interactive fiction telling the origin story of a band, like video games meets The Gorillaz—it's unique and interesting. Whether OFK has more discography planned or not, it does seem like they've done something a bit outside the box already.

PixelOpus, a Sony-owned studio known for making games like Entwined and Concrete Genie, is shutting down. The studio announced its closure earlier today, as the team looks to "new futures."
In a post on Twitter, the PixelOpus crew thanked players for supporting their work.
"Dear friends, our PixelOpus adventure has to an end," the statement reads. "As we look to new futures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to the millions of passionate players who have supported us, and our mission to make beautiful, imaginative games with heart. We are so grateful!"
https://twitter.com/Pixelopus/status/1654563543386296320
Sony confirmed the closure in a statement to IGN, stating that the studio will officially shut down on June 2. Here's the full statement:
PlayStation Studios regularly evaluates its portfolio and the status of studio projects to ensure they meet the organization’s short and long-term strategic objectives. As part of a recent review process, it has been decided that PixelOpus will close on June 2.

Studio members have been sharing their sentiments on social media, lamenting the "loss of a great team, and a great project." The studio had previously been working on an unannounced project within PlayStation Studios.
The opus comes to a close
PixelOpus was established in 2014 as a new in-house studio for Sony Interactive Entertainment. The team went on to make 2014's Entwined and then, in 2019, released Concrete Genie. The latter was fairly well-received.
We described it in our review as a lower-stakes adventure that was good for unwinding, and it had a pretty cool idea in its supernatural-graffiti concept. Overall, it sounded cool and this closure is sad to hear. Hopefully, everyone on the team lands on their feet.

Former homebrew NES title Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is making a stop on the Nintendo Switch on May 19, 2023. This follows a release on Xbox consoles in April 2022 and on NES in 2010.
Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is one of the more beloved homebrew titles for Nintendo’s classic console. Developed by Sivak Games and drawing inspiration from Mega Man and I Wanna Be The Guy, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is a die-and-retry gauntlet.
https://youtu.be/4vvMLR-17Jo
I actually own a copy of the NES title from its initial run with RetroUSB. Personally, I didn’t really love the game. However, I do recognize it as a quality homebrew project. I’ve played quite a bit of homebrew, and they’re extremely hit-and-miss, with the majority landing in the miss category. Often, they’re first-time projects for programmers, and I can really appreciate the passion behind them, even if I own a few that I can’t stand. I’m not naming any names. It’s mostly just that I rarely enjoy the die-and-retry genre, with Hotline Miami being one of the few I really love.
Still, I don’t regret having that transparent green NES cartridge on my shelf. Homebrew has come a long way in the last decade. More and more companies have been getting into production. It warms my dusty, old heart.
In any case, I’m happy to see that Battle Kid: The Fortress of Peril isn’t staying locked on the hardware. The title is especially a good fit for the Switch, as it’s a console with a very pick-up-and-play mentality.
If you’re not into the Switch version or don’t want to wait, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, or via ROM from itch.io.

It’s a great injustice that we never got to see more of Goemon in the West. While you can count the number of games we got over here on enough fingers if you have them, it was one of Konami’s flagship properties for over a decade in Japan. Part of the reason why we didn’t get more over here is that they’re just so Japanese. It takes place in Feudal Japan and ties in more local pop-culture references than you can shake a pipe at.
Despite this, I was enamored by 1991’s Legend of the Mystical Ninja when I was a kid. It was fun to just mess around and explore in. So, when Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon wound up being localized, I was all over it, and it was one of the most fascinatingly confusing moments of my young life.

Terranigma is an SNES Action RPG with a flawed translation. Characters occasionally act in ways that defy logic, and plot threads appear to contradict each other. Terranigma is also, without question, one of the best narratives I’ve experienced in a video game. For this reason, I put it in the Top 3 of the greatest SNES games ever made.
Terranigma is the culmination of what is referred to as developer Quintet's "Soul Blazer trilogy” on the SNES. Though it’s technically canon to Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia, Terranigma's connection to these games is mostly on a philosophical level (though you'll find a couple plot connections). You see, Quintet had the unique objective of using their 16-bit titles to explore the core of human nature. For Terranigma speci…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or so I'm told
Purveyor of lo-fi horror games Torture Star Video has announced that they will be publishing Marevo Collective’s 2020 indie hit, No One Lives Under the Lighthouse on consoles May 18, 2023. This includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.
Released on PC April 21, 2020, No One Lives Under the Lighthouse is a short-form horror that sees you taking over the duties at a lighthouse after the previous keeper went missing. Presented in terrifying PS1-o-vision, you’re tasked with unraveling the mystery while also tending to the needs of the titular lighthouse. It’s estimated at two hours long, which is usually a good mark for these sorts of games.
https://twitter.com/PuppetCombo/status/1654476492326285318?s=20
I actually bought No One Lives Under the Lighthouse on Steam, but haven’t gotten around to playing this. I’d probably prefer to stick with the PC version, but these sorts of games do tend to be a good fit for consoles.
Also, while I don’t believe Puppet Combo had any involvement with the development of the game, having their publishing label, Torture Star Video, handle the distribution of it is a good fit. Both brands are pretty synonymous with lo-fi horror, so it’s a good way to get more eyes on the title. Especially when it’s alongside games like Nun Massacre and Murder House.
Torture Star Video has promised that it will be bringing more games to console in the near future.
No One Lives Under the Lighthouse is currently available on PC. It will be coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox SeriesX|S, and Switch on May 18, 2023.

Do you feel like you need to kick your cooking up several notches? Have you considered traveling back in time and stealing all the recipes your ancestors used to kill their hearts and teeth? I bet you have! Thankfully, A Time Traveller’s Guide to Past Delicacies is here to help you make that a reality.
Produced by Fantasia Malware and developed by Gabriel Helfenstein, A Time Traveller’s Guide to Past Delicacies is an educational game where puppets from the present teach you how to steal and cook food from the past. It’s the sort of game that I can only accurately describe by screaming until my vocal cords tear while I struggle against the bindings of my straight jacket.
So, I will do that.

Creating an engaging and humorous point-and-click adventure can be a hefty challenge at the best of times, but for developer Robust Games, the endeavour provided a much-needed release from the isolation that the nationwide lockdowns spawned during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Since its initial announcement for the Switch at the tail-end of 2021, you'd be forgiven if Loco Motive slipped from your mind through 2022 as its planned release window came and went. But when a simple tweet from creative director Adam Riches garnered nearly 15,000 likes just a couple of weeks ago, it's clear that this comedic twist on a classic Agatha Christie story is resonating with murder mystery fans worldwide.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Epic Games Store has revealed the next free items that it will soon be offering up to its userbase gratis — And this time around it's something a little more specific, as The Daring Lifestyle Bundle for EA's popular simulator The Sims 4 will be available to download from May 11.
The bundle contains a total of three pretty chunky expansion packs. The Jungle Adventure Game Pack will allow your Sims to venture into the land of "Selvadorada", and features Indiana Jones-esque items such as temples, treasures, cursed relics, and jungle fineries. Also included are new foods, dance moves, and clothing, reflective of the Selvadorada communities.

The second include expansion pack is titled Luxury Party Stuff and, as the name denotes, is filled with items to allow your Sims to throw the mother of all classy bashes. Fashionable dresses and evening wear, new decor and party decorations, and a veritable banquet of new food items and table dressings. See how the other half live and pretend to be part of such decadence.
The third and final expansion pack is Fashion Street Kit, and is packed out with a wardrobe full of trendy, modern clothing inspired by the vibrancy and iconic designs of Mumbai, curated by artist Shruti Sitara Singh. With a focus on patterning and bold colors, the Fashion Street Kit brings brand-new looks to your Sims, along with new emotes and other additions.
While this EGS freebie is obviously only really relevant to Sims players, everyone still has time to bag the great line-up of current offerings, which include Against All Odds, Horizon Chase Turbo, and fun platformer Kao the Kangaroo. The Sims Daring Lifestyles Bundle will be available from May 11-18.

But what do these consoles look like outside of promotional photos? How do they appear fresh out of the box? Do the colours really pop just like they do in our dreams? If only there was a way to find out...
Fortunately, there is! Our lovely video producer Alex has managed to get his hands on all three special edition models and has made an almighty unboxing video to show what each looks like up close. This includes the bright Splatoon 3 colour way, the chaotic Pokémon Scarlet and Violet one, and the latest Zelda design. Ok, it's only those three, but that's a pretty good lineup all the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Laying a solid foundation
MinskWorks has announced that their poverty-stricken construction game, Landlord’s Super, will be seeing its full release on May 25. They initially released the early version in April of 2020.
Landlord’s Super is a sandbox game set against the backdrop of ‘80s Brittain. It’s a time of sweeping unemployment. You play as someone who, unable to find a job, decides to construct a house and rent it out. With very little money and few opportunities, you need to beg, borrow, and steal your supplies to create a worthwhile hovel.
https://youtu.be/wrRU6HGkNRM
It’s a construction simulator first. You mix your cements and mortars, and build the home brick-by-brick. You’re given a lot of freedom in how you do this, but the amount of work required to complete a home is intense.
Underlying this is a representation of the time period. While building your home, you have to maintain yourself by eating, drinking, and showering. This also means you may be spending time at the local pub. To make money, you can do odd jobs around town, or simply wash dishes for a small stipend. It’s drudgery, but it’s fun drudgery.
I’ve played quite a bit of Landlord’s Super in Early Access. It’s an interesting period piece that unapologetically adheres to the struggles of the time it represents. I have my complaints about the game, but I’m looking forward to seeing how it has all come together.
Landlord’s Super is currently available on Steam Early Access. The full version will be released on May 25, 2023.

I've kind of worried about it ever since, so I was glad to see it released recently, and gladder still that it's a lot of fun.

They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Well, we're just sure that Nintendo is going to be completely 'flattered' when it discovers the recent marketing tactic used by mobile RPG Kung Fu Saga, which blatantly rips off some of Tears of the Kingdom's new mechanics such as Fuse and Recall (thanks, Nintendúo).
A recent advert for the mobile app shows a green-dressed hero (*eyebrow raises*) heading up to an 'aerial dungeon' by riding on a piece of falling debris (*eyebrow raises higher*), before using the new 'weapon synthesis feature' to stick, or should we say 'fuse', a nearby boulder to their stick and attack a hoard of enemies (*eyebrow reaches its peak, there's no going back*). Does this ring any bells?

LEGO 2K Drive might not even be off of the starting grid just yet, but that hasn't prevented publisher 2K Games from announcing four seasons of post-release content, as well as the premium-paid "Drive Pass."
Starting in June, LEGO 2K Drive will begin its rollout of four seasons of additional content, each containing "100 levels" as well as new vehicles, drivers, stickers, sounds, brick packs, and other rewards. Most of this content will be free to all players as each season arrives, but an additional paid "Drive Pass" will let brick-laden drivers gun through an array of additional rewards, which will include exclusive vehicles sponsored by real-world brands such as Dodge and Nissan.
https://twitter.com/LEGO_2K_HUB/status/1654124346632470529?s=20
2K also notes that the LEGO 2K Drive seasons will not have time limits, so anyone picking up the free or premium Drive Pass will not be forced to grind through to the end before any specific deadline. More details as to the contents of the seasons will be released as each respective event approaches. LEGO 2K Drive, first revealed back in March, adapts the globally popular brick-based toy to the raceway, and will allow players to engage in local and online races, while also building vehicles, playing mini-games, and taking on a full single-player story campaign.
LEGO 2K Drive launches May 19 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Multiple editions of the title are now available for pre-order, ranging from a standard $60-70 edition to a princely $120 "Awesome Rivals" Edition.

We're now just a week away from the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – it releases exclusively on Nintendo Switch on 12th May – and if you're wanting to buy the game digitally, we have just the deal for you.
Owning a digital copy of Tears of the Kingdom will make a lot of sense for those of us who will be playing it every day for the next few months – keeping it on an SD card sounds much more efficient than swapping out game cartridges every day, after all. The game costs $69.99 / £59.99 on the Nintendo eShop, however, making it Nintendo's most expensive Switch game ever in the US. So, here's how to get a discount...

Across a run, you travel a strange land playing hockey matches and earning upgrades to boost your team with better stats and whole new abilities. It's an interesting idea and quite a silly game, with a daft tone and some cheery ultraviolence.

According to TheWrap, Urban, perhaps best known for playing the titular role in the excellent Dredd (2012), as well as portraying Billy Butcher in the smash hit Amazon show The Boys, is rumored to be on the cusp of accepting the role, which will see him don the wraparound shades of one of the most well-known and grudgingly beloved characters in the Mortal Kombat franchise. Johnny Cage, as fans will know, is depicted as a martial arts expert with an ego a mile wide and a line in smart-arse dialogue.

Shortly before release, Valve bestowed it with Verified status for the Steam Deck, a coveted green tick that represents more or less complete compatibility and suitability for the portable PC. 
I wouldn’t normally curl an eyebrow at this sort of thing – having more great Steam Deck games is good for PC gaming – but given how all-over-the-shop Redfall’s performance is on desktop PCs, could it really settle in on the less powerful Deck? A few ambulatory vamp slaying jaunts later, I can conclude that it... maaaaaybe can. Sort of.

While many will have spent varying amounts of time and money to achieve the former (not writing from personal experience, of course *ahem*), the new Pokémon Horizons anime might have just given us an idea of the latter.
The series is currently airing in Japan and is yet to be given a release date out West, that being said, Serebii webmaster @JoeMerrick has taken to Twitter to show one particular revelation from a recent episode which shows what the interior of a Luxury Ball might look like.

Upon arrival, however, Megafig is nowhere to be found, and the player must explore the terrain, communicate with the locals, and study and record the behaviors of a strange race of food-based creatures — the titular "Bugsnax".

Following a successful marketing campaign, Young Horses released Bugsnax to mostly positive reviews, with critics and players enjoying the game's colorful visuals and interesting world, as well as its oddly unnerving premise and storytelling. The new iOS port has been redesigned for the mobile platform, and will feature optimized HUD and control systems for touchscreen devices. It will also support numerous controllers for though who wish to play the traditional way.
Bugsnax launches this summer on iOS, and is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

If you are a fan of SEGA's blue blur and you have happened to find yourself on Twitter over the past couple of days, then you may have noticed that the phrase 'Sonic 5' popping up. Is this official confirmation of a new game? Absolutely not. Is the rumour thread a little tenuous? Yes, somewhat.
Rumours of Sonic 5 can all fundamentally be linked back to supposed leaks from last year which circulated around a 'modern 2D Sonic game'. The game in question was spawned from the cancellation of Sonic Mania 2, it is theorised, which supposedly came about following a pay dispute from the original team amongst other reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall, an open world FPS by the folks over at Arkane, plays like a game that was pulled in so many directions over its development that it exploded into various bits, which were then patchworked together into a live service game that already feels like it's been abandoned. Flashes of Arkane's brilliance make an appearance, but they are a rare find amidst a bland, incoherent world that clearly points to deeper issues in a game that's been drained of its magic.

Remember the original Pokémon Pokédex toy released by Tiger Electronics and Hasbro Toys back in the day? Well, apparently Nintendo's Japanese team made it an absolute nightmare to bring to market.
Speaking to Johto Times recently, former Tiger & Hasbro senior game producer Chris Nicolella (between 1997 - 2001) revealed the entire story behind the development cycle - explaining how Nintendo's Japanese headquarters wasn't a big fan of the US toy company and made the entire process "very difficult" due to concerns about the device taking sales from the Game Boy releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From turtles and cars to one man's mountain
Apple's mobile gaming subscription service Apple Arcade is getting a fresh batch of new games. Today, Apple revealed 20 new games coming to the subscription service.
One of the leaders of the pack is TMNT Splintered Fate, a co-op roguelike adventure starring the turtles. The crew is searching for Splinter, and will journey around New York City looking for clues while also picking up randomized power-ups.
Triband, the studio behind What the Golf? and What the Bat?, is also here with What the Car? It's a fittingly quirky take on motor vehicles, the kind that Triband has been especially good at over its other games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5wx0Takylc
Even more are on the docket, including some familiar faces like Getting Over It and Limbo. Here's the full list of today's games:
Games coming to Apple Arcade, May 2023
TMNT Splintered Fate
Disney SpellStruck
What the Car?
Cityscapes: Sim Builder
Chess Universe+
Disney Coloring World+
Disney Getaway Blast+
Farming Simulator 20+
Getting Over It+
Hill Climb Racing+
Iron Marines+
Kingdom Two Crowns+
Playdead's Limbo+
My Town Home - Family Games+
Octodad: Dadliest Catch+
PPKP+
Snake.io+
Temple Run+
Time Locker+
Very Little Nightmares+
It's a pretty solid lineup, with some familiar faces and neat new additions in there. I personally like the idea of seeing someone trying to make their way up the hill of Bennett Foddy's Getting Over It, and the ensuing frustration, in mobile form.
Apple Arcade has had some pretty stellar games hit the service over the years, from Hironobu Sakaguchi's Fantasian to the recent mobile version of Game Freak's Pocket Card Jockey. I'm certainly curious to see if some more hits await in this update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The DMCA claims another court victory
Bungie has succeeded in the latest of an increasing line of lawsuits targeting online cheat sellers — The Destiny 2 developer was awarded $12 million in damages this week in its case against website VeteranCheats and its owner, Mihai Claudiu-Florentin.
As reported by The Game Post, Bungie filed suit against Romanian Claudi-Florentin in 2021, accusing the website owner of committing copyright infringement and tortious interference through the development selling of various hacks and cheats, distributed through the VeteranCheats domain. The key software allows players to see through walls and auto-aim, alongside other in-game advantages.
Bungie argued that the sale of VeteranCheats had caused significant harm to Destiny 2 and its community, frustrating users and undermining the game's intent. Bungie sought default judgment of just over $12 million USD, including statutory damages of $2,000 for each of the cheat's 5,848 downloads, as well as an additional $146,000 for copyright violation, and payment for the studio's legal fees.
The District Court of Washington found in favor of Bungie's claim, and ordered a total damage reparation of $12,059,912.98. In addition, Claudi-Florentin was barred from engaging in any activity that opposes Bungie's copyright act and DMCA rulings. As of this writing, the VeteranCheats website is still operational, selling cheats for other popular video games including Call of Duty and PUBG. The Destiny 2 hacks, obviously, have since been removed.
This lawsuit represents the latest of a series of successful suits Bungie has filed against online cheat sellers, having previously won damage cases against companies such as AimJunkies, LaviCheats, and Elite Boss Tech.

In early April, South Korean developer Npixel started posting a piece of concept art each day on their Twitter showing off their upcoming open-world action MMO Chrono Odyssey. Now they have released their first-ever gameplay trailer for the new title, and wow, it's looking pretty epic so far.
Built from the ground up using Unreal Engine 5, Chrono Odyssey takes place in the vast open-world wilderness of Setera. According to producer Samuel Seo via a post on Playstation Blog, the world of Setera will feature a living and breathing environment that transforms with dynamic weather and seasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boxing. Just boxing.
Tuatara Games have dropped their multi-player alien-smacker, Bare Butt Boxing, on Early Access today.
Bare Butt Boxing is a physics-based fighting game. You don the big padded gloves of punching and duke it out with a fleet of other aliens doing the same. The goal is to clobber your friends and family enough to launch them into conveniently supplied portals to get points. There’s a veritable charcuterie of boxing arenas to throw down in, each with unique hazards and quirks.
https://youtu.be/1eSIWYGq4fo
I’m getting some real Gang Beasts vibes from Bare Butt Boxing, only less chaotic. There’s always a bit of chaos when you lean on physics, I’m just not sure that anyone here is going to get thrown into a grinder and be turned into a sausage.
Bare Butt Boxing comes to us from the esteemed developers of 2017’s Let Them Come. Needless to say, their follow-up goes in quite a different direction by presenting an alien’s take on the gentleman’s sport. It looks like some quick fun that might be a good time if you break it out at a family event. If you’re like me, and everyone in the neighborhood has a restraining order against you, there’s online play. That way, you can go fist-to-fist against strangers who don’t know about your sordid past.
Bare Butt Boxing is currently available exclusively on Steam Early Access. However, the plan is to release it on Switch, PS4, and PS5 when it hits version 1.0. Right now, the developers are planning on 10-12 months in Early Access.

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a bit different from Don't Nod's previous work. It's not the setting, as the studio is well-known for supernatural mysteries, whether it's Life is Strange, Tell Me Why, or others. It's the look of Harmony, and the form the story takes, that make this a peculiar and intriguing new story for Don't Nod.
Right away, the difference is felt in Harmony's opening. It's gorgeously animated, as protagonist Polly sets out for the day, surround by near-future tech. There's a cutting-edge world pinned up against homes made in emptied pools that really sets a tone early on. Polly's returned home to help search for her missing mother, Ursula, but soon gets swept up in much more than she bargained for in the Reverie.

Gaming is pretty great these days, but there are a handful of things we miss from the olden times before everything went online. Game stores are a big one — there's nothing like wandering down to your local emporium and seeing row upon row of actual genuine video games, consoles and accessories old and new. You know, as opposed to a wall of Funko Pops, a chair with blinking lights, and a cabinet of secondhand Samsung Galaxies.
Game magazines are another thing we miss. There are still some stalwart publications hanging in there, thankfully, and there's something intimate and special about holding print in your hands and poring over physical pages for your gaming news and reviews. It's a feeling we do our best to replicate on the site, which leads us to our newest regular feature. Introducing the Nintendo Life Mailbox.

Steam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. 


Polly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. 
Harmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.

“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”
Spencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …]]></summary>

Valiant Entertainment has announced that Blowfish Studios will be returning Shadowman to the world of video games in Shadowman: Darque Legacy. This will be the first game to feature the property since 2002’s Shadow Man: 2econd Coming on PS2.
We don’t have much to go on here. Valiant has released a short teaser for the upcoming title, and boy, is it teasing. It’s one of those teasers where it pans across junk lying around before finally settling on one particular thing. In this case, it’s a scythe. And then something sinister happens, and it cuts out.

Thankfully, the press release has a bit more information, such as this quote from Blowfish Studios:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take one look at Luna Abyss and you'll probably go, 'Wait a minute, this looks like first-person Returnal!' And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. 
There's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.

Normally, this is the part where I talk about a featured game or two that's hitting the Switch eShop (including ones Nintendo deems fit to trot out). Instead, Nintendo is touting the recent Fortnite Star Wars collab as the biggest thing going on this week, which tells you everything you need to know! Even if you delve into the full list below, things are pretty sparse.
Nothing really even wants to be coming out in the wake of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom next Friday, which makes a lot of sense. In reality, one of the few games of note hitting the eShop this week is the Hasbro Kids Bundle: consisting of PJ Masks: Heroes of the Night, My Friend Peppa Pig, and Transformers: Battlegrounds. Don't get too excited: the triple-pack does not contain the controversial Peppa Pig: World Adventures, which features a tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II.

I can just about (by the skin of my teeth) make a profitable park, but my god, that park will have the worst layout you've ever seen in your cursed, vomiting in the bins at a Disneyland life. But look, if the park works, it works, right? The shareholders can't complain!
Thing is, much like with the internet or your mum's relationship with the binman, theme park simulators can really change while you're not paying attention. While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.

Xbox Head of Gaming Phil Spencer has expressed his disappointment at the player reception to Arkane's much-maligned vampire hunter Redfall, which launched just two days ago to overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and players.
"I'm disappointed, I'm upset with myself," said Spencer this morning, speaking on the kinda Funny Games show. "There's nothing more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community."
"The critical response was not what we wanted," Spencer continued, adding "We're gonna continue to work on the game. We've shown a commitment to games like Sea of Thieves, and Grounded, to continue to go and build games. But I also know these games are $70, and I'm gonna take full responsibility for launching a game that needs to be great…]]></summary>

But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  
There are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…]]></summary>

The ultra-charming island adventure title Tchia has surpassed one million sales since its initial release last month — This accomplishment was proudly announced by publisher Kepler Interactive and developer Awaceb just six weeks on from the title's release on PlayStation and PC platforms.
The sunny funny RPG puts the player in the role of the titular adventurer, who must explore a tropical island while searching for the whereabouts of her missing father. Blessed with the ability of "soul-jumping", Tchia is able to leap into the bodies of other sentient and inanimate beings, using the speed, agility, and abilities of these creatures and items in order to navigate the world and overcome its obstacles. Tchia is also "armed" with a magical ukelele, which she can use to alter the game world, summoning animals, changing the time of day and weather, and affecting the landscape itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBhlxXbcyC4&ab_channel=Awaceb
With its unique concepts, cartoonish and expressive visuals, and overall wholesome vibe, Tchia won over critics and fans, receiving mostly positive response from both. Already available to purchase in digital form, Maximum Games has announced that it will be releasing a physical edition on PS4 and PS5 on July 18, which should be readily available online and from high street retailers, which will no doubt add to Tchia impressive sales record. It's a fine success story for a humble and heartfelt release, and the title itself is well worth checking out for a lazy weekend of fun in the sun.
Tchia is available now on PlayStation and PC (via Epic Games Store.)

(I also ran out of time to put our voting form together - apologies!). But as we all continue zhoooming our lightsabers around in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor or jumping aboard the stellar space train in Honkai: Star Rail, it still feels like an appropriate time to ask you this all-important question: what are your favourite space games of all time?

It's May 4th! Yes, May the fourth is with us (hmm, that doesn't really work) and we're republishing our ranked list of every Star Wars game on Nintendo consoles, but now with a twist! We've rejigged the ranked list below to be governed by each game's User Rating in our database, meaning that the order is now dynamic and entirely reader-ranked — and subject to real-time change, even after publication.
In order to rate any of the games on the list below out of 10, logged-in Nintendo Life users can simply tap the 'star', assign it a personal rating, and refresh the page to see any changes reflected. With various of the games in the lower half of the list only having a handful of ratings at the time of writing, there's plenty of potential for change in the coming days. It will be fascinating to see how the ranking shakes down as we move onto May 5th, May 6th, and other similarly un-Star Wars-y dates. Enjoy!

According to Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto, the veteran publisher is hoping that its next major release, Street Fighter 6 will sell a mighty 10 million copies over the course of its lifespan. Tsujimoto made the comments earlier this week in an interview with Japanese publication Famitsu.
"The Street Fighter series is our flagship title, so we had no hesitation in investing in it," Tsujimoto said, in comments translated by VGC. "Over the past few years, multiple titles in the Resident Evil series have sold 10 million copies, and the Monster Hunter series now has titles that are aiming for 20 million copies."
"Street Fighter V has already sold over seven million copies, so if we can make use of our digital sales experience, we should be able to aim…]]></summary>

The Big N haven’t gotten around to it yet, but indie developers Rokaplay and Firechick have beaten them to the punch with Super Dungeon Maker, which just released out of early access. It’s what the name implies: a game where you can build your own classic Zelda-like dungeons, share them online, and then play through other people’s whacky creations.

Publisher Assemble Entertainment and developer Digital Rabbit have today announced that Fall of Porcupine, a wholesome 2D adventure game about the trials and tribulations of working in the healthcare industry, will be heading over to Switch on 15th June — and there's even a new trailer to go with it.
The game will see you playing as Finley, a newly-qualified medical practitioner, as he begins his first hospital job in the town of Porcupine. The anthropomorphised characters and storybook aesthetics give off a strong 'cosy games' vibe like we saw with Beacon Pines last year, but, as was the case with the aforementioned title, Fall of Porcupine is not quite as cuddly as it may initially seem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   


Beginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. "We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to," he says. "The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally."

Industry legend Takahashi Meijin, best known for his work with Hudson Soft and his '16 shots per second' trigger finger, is (suitably) one of the supervisors on Star Gagnant, an upcoming rapid-fire shmup that flies onto Switch on 25th May.
Published by Regista, the game employs a unique rapid-fire system which will have you selecting a fire rate for various different situations and keeping an eye on your special gauge to ensure that it works as well as it can. There are four different modes available (arcade, caravan, challenge and rapid fire), each of which provides a twist on the standard shmup format so that the game can be played however you'd like.

When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being "point designers" for certain characters. "Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero," Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. 
Both are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards. But when I ask Solomon at GDC if he thinks he has a particular design 'style' that unites his crop of Marvel heroes, he says he loves being "bombastic".

Activision Blizzard has announced that it will be holding a live stream presentation next week for its incoming adventure sequel Diablo IV — The stream, set for Wednesday, May 10, will focus on some of the new elements coming to the Satanic franchise, such as seasons, cosmetics, and the Battle Pass.
None more Satanic.
While mechanics such as seasons and Battle Passes are generally reserved for multiplayer-centric titles with a daily online grind, particularly shooters and battle royale releases, these elements are been creeping further and further into other genres, such as fighting games and more single-player-centric experiences. The inclusion of a Battle Pass in particular seems an odd fit for Diablo IV, a title that generally consists of one/two players pushing through a narrative campaign, while earning a metric ton of loot and gear en route.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsNDMHvz98M&ab_channel=Diablo
Regardless, we'll soon know more about the controversial implementation of these features. Blizzard has already told us that they expect it to take "around 80 hours" to complete each Battle Pass, and that a Diablo IV season is expected to last in the region of around three-to-four months. Next Wednesday's stream should finalize some of these details, as well as showing fans some of the cosmetic and other items that can be earned during Battle Pass progress.
The live stream will take place Wednesday, May 10 at 11:00 PT / 14:00 ET / 19:00 BST, and can be watched on the official Diablo social media channels, including YouTube and Twitch.
Diablo IV launches June 6 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Pre-order customers will be granted Early Access from June 1.

Giants Software has released a first-look gameplay trailer for Farming Simulator 23, showing all of the agricultural additions that we can expect to find as the game ploughs its way onto Switch on 23rd May.
For the most part, this is yet another farm sim game (we know, shocking), but there are some new features that have been added this time around to ensure that the game is fresh and ripe for the picking. This includes an expanded number of machinery and crop choices and the introduction of two new maps inspired by American and European environments.

Today we're back with a similar deal on the Logitech Wireless Starter Kit, which bundles a K380 keyboard and M185 mouse for £40 (down from £50). Both elements are surprisingly high-quality for the price, with a nicer-looking and better-feeling scissor switch keyboard with circular keycaps and a compact 2.4GHz mouse that provides better speed and accuracy than a trackpad.

This also means the original Pokemon Trading Card Game Online app will be removed from mobile and PC on June 5, at 9 a.m. PT. Accounts use the same Trainer club account log-in, and you can read up on how to migrate those over here.
The heart of the cards
As someone who already collects Pokemon cards but doesn't really play the actual competitive card game (I just like the cool art, okay), this update feels a little targeted at me. I've only played a little bit of TCG Live, but it's definitely a visual upgrade, and there are systems in place to encourage learning.
I'm still hungry for the days of the Pokemon Trading Card Game on the Game Boy, which Arceus willing, will hit Nintendo Switch Online at some point. But hey, maybe I'll run a bunch of code cards through the TCG Live service and see if I can rekindle the card game flame.

Get your card shuffler ready. Sunshine Shuffle, the narrative poker game from the creators of An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs, is on its way for a May 24, 2023 release date.
Sunshine Shuffle is a fusion of storytelling and poker. You climb aboard the S.S. Sunshine and play poker with a capybara and other less interesting critters. The twist is that these cute creatures took part in a bank heist. As long as you pony up and put your chips on the line, they’re willing to let you in on the details.
https://youtu.be/ts-bYpfXiCc
As a warning, the soundtrack apparently consists of ska. I don’t have an issue with the genre, but some people talk about it like it’s an auditory disease. I’d probably start breaking things if a game played modern, pop-country at me, so I feel a warning is fair.
I like the idea of a narrative poker game more so than I would a game that is just poker. Years of rotting my brain with video games means I can’t sit still for ten seconds without ample visual feedback. Poker Night at the Inventory toyed around with the idea by having various video game and video game adjacent characters banter at the table. Additionally, I’d really like to know how such a regal, perfect creature like the capybara could be driven to crime.
You can find out all the sordid details in Sunshine Shuffle on May 24, 2023 on PC or Switch. Or both. I’m not your game mom.

If you remember that a new Saints Row game came out in the summer of last year, then you might be pleased to hear that the open-world adventure's first DLC expansion will finally arrive next week, nine months on from the game's initial release on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The Heist and The Hazardous — which hits all platforms on May 9 — will see our uber-trendy gangsters on a mission of vengeance, tracking down the double-crossing Hollywood star Chris Hardy following a botched assignment. The expansion will feature new in-game events, story missions, and a wardrobe full of new clothing, weapons, and other related chicanery. The Heist and The Hazardous is the first of three paid DLC expansions planned for the title in 2023.
https://twitter.com/SaintsRow/status/1653399037180010500?s=20
Saints Row, which launched last August after being delayed from its initial spring release date, saw the tongue-in-cheek crime franchise rebooted with an oddly elite fashion aesthetic and a cast of younger, entrepreneurial stars. While the game itself was serviceable, with high-octane action and an appetite for destruction, many critics and fans were non-plussed at the reboot's general vibe, complaining about a dated mission design, obnoxious and offputting dialogue, as well as a slew of technical issues.
Developer Volition has been releasing updates to correct the latter problems, which has led to this long delay between launch and DLC drops. Soon after release, it was announced that Volition was being transferred from Deep Silver to another Embracer Group publisher, Gearbox Entertainment.
Saints Row is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. But not Stadia. Not anymore.

Square Enix has announced a release date for In Tanta We Trust, the DLC expansion for its mythical adventure title Forspoken — The new campaign content will arrive May 26 on PC and PS5.
While the action-packed trailer doesn't offer much in the way of context, we can see that Frey Holland, now truly coming to terms with the incredible powers afforded her in the kingdom of Athia, has been seemingly joined on the battlefield by no less than Tanta Cinta herself. The two magic-infused warriors will face new enemies and threats as they search for a way to purge Athia of the energy-sucking anomaly known as "The Break". Players can expect an extension to Athia's already huge map, as well as new spells, skills, friends and foes. Will we get new cat familiars? I hope so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc1xcGp1PyM&ab_channel=SquareEnix
Am I going to die on the Forspoken defense hill? No, I am not, the moment has passed and fate has made its decision. But that doesn't mean that I agree with all of the flack directed towards what was, essentially, a perfectly fine adventure with some excellent stand-out setpieces and some lovely world and character design. While hardly the most original of open-world adventures, I really liked the synergetic combat, I really liked the costuming and special effects, and... fact is... I really liked Frey.
In Tanta We Trust will, quite possibly, be the last we ever hear from the Forspoken franchise, given its disappointing sales, and combined with the fact that developer Luminous Productions has essentially been assimilated into Square Enix proper. If so, I hope that Frey, Athia, and, of course, Homer, are all given a fitting finale that sends the audience home happy.
Forspoken is available now on PS5 and PC. In Tanta We Trust will launch on May 26.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced that a standalone version of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered will hit PlayStation 5 later this month. 
Previously, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered was only available by purchasing the Ultimate Edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Later this month, anyone will be able to play Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. Players will be able to purchase it standalone or, if you own Marvel's Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 (or its Digital Deluxe Edition or Game of the Year Edition), then you can pay $10 to upgrade to Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered on PS5. 
This remaster is perhaps most famous for introducing a redesigned face for Peter Parker, but it also includes The City That Never Sleeps expansion starring Black Cat as well as some exclusive Spidey suits, such as those from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Owners of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales can still obtain Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered by upgrading to the Ultimate Edition through the main menu of the PS5 version of the game. If you're looking to buy the remastered game standalone, it will cost you $49.99. 
PlayStation says this standalone version and upgrade path is coming later this month, but it doesn't say exactly when. 


In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Marvel's Spider-Man and then read our thoughts on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

Players can download the de_voyna map, which recreates an abandoned Eastern European city that’s not too dissimilar to the war-torn streets you might find in other multiplayer maps. The difference here is a secret underground room that contains information about the invasion: headlines, maps, newspaper clippings, and images of the war.

And then, strangely enough, the voice actor behind the game's Venom hinted on Twitter that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be released this September. While we still don't have official confirmation of when we'll be playing this game, we do know when we'll get our next taste of Insomniac Games' Spider-Man world: this weekend. 
That's because on Free Comic Book day, which is this Saturday on May 6, PlayStation will release a prequel comic book for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. 
"When we initially sat down with the team at Marvel, we explored a few different ideas about what kinds of stories we could tell in a prequel comic," Insomniac Games narrative director Jon Paquette writes in a PlayStation Blo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.
Set in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. 


According to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). 
Double Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Well, Arma 3 developers Bohemia Interactive are taking a punt at blending the two genres with Silica, in the hopes that you can both shoot and command things with equal levels of good. It's the first project to hatch from Bohemia's incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.
Silica is largely the work of one developer, Martin "Dram" Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia's Take On Mars. Having given Silica a whirl for over an hour, I struggle to see whether the RTS, FPS hybrid can truly offer the best of both worlds. It does, however, make being a crab extremely good.

Earlier this year, the company showcased various games, including Redfall and the shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush, at an Xbox and Bethesda Direct in January. Microsoft said at the time that a standalone Starfield show was in the works to "dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive" into the game, and now we know when that's happening: June 11, immediately after the June 11 Xbox Games Showcase.

Playing as a student, you're free to decide how to spend your free time, which characters to spend it with, and who to inevitably romance by the end of the game. Plenty of options, for sure, but Persona 3 Portable was the last time we could choose our protagonist’s gender in the series. Until now. Thanks to the simply titled “P5R Female Protagonist” mod, you can now replace the default male protagonist Joker in Persona 5 Royal with a she/her Joker. On paper, that would seem like a novel change in a lot of games, but in the mammoth-sized Persona 5, a change like that requires some very impressive modding.

It's the Cooler Master SK622, a gaming-optimised 60% design that offers low profile switches, a UK layout (with optional RGB backlighting) and the flexibility of wired (USB-C), Bluetooth and lower-latency 2.4GHz wireless.
The CM SK622 retailed for over £100 back in the day, but now it's available for half-price: £49.98. That's an awesome deal for any mechanical keyboard, much less one from a name brand with wireless connectivity!

Arkane's latest strikes me as an open world shooter with a few simple strands that never seem to go anywhere. Occasionally, there are flashes of a team that - as we all know - are capable of brilliance, but Redfall has me following a path of irritation, and feeling a slight sadness for what might've been.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Firaxis Games has revealed the release date for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of its 2022 strategy card game, Marvel's Midnight Suns, alongside news that the planned Switch version has now been canceled. 
Midnight Suns hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2, 2022, with plans for the PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions to launch at a later date. Today, Firaxis announced that the PS4 and Xbox One versions will launch next week on May 11, which is the same day the game's fourth and final DLC – Blood Storm, which introduces Storm as a playable hero – releases. 
As for why the Switch version has been canceled, Firaxis doesn't provide anything more than, "Note that a Nintendo Switch version of Marvel's Midnight Suns is no longer planned." This follows news from earlier this year that the game's director (and the director of Firaxis' modern XCOM games), Jake Solomon, is departing from the studio. 
PS4 and Xbox One players that purchase the Legendary Edition of Midnight Suns or the game's Season Pass will get the new Blood Storm DLC as well as all previously released DLC, which alongside Storm adds Deadpool, Morbius, and Venom to the game.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Midnight Suns review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite experiences of 2022, and as it approaches its first anniversary on May 5, the team behind it reveals it's begun work on its next project.
Gareth Damian Martin, the solo developer behind Jump Over the Age, is again joining forces with indie publisher Fellow Traveler, character artist Guillaume Singelin, and composer Amos Roddy on a new game. There’s no information about what this next title entails, but the team promises to reveal more in the “near future.” The coming days serve as a celebration for Citizen Sleeper, with the game receiving a 33 percent discount on PC and Switch starting May 4. 
Citizen Sleeper is a sci-fi choice-driven adventure where players guide a robot possessing a human consciousness through life on a space station, fighting for survival while also helping the lives of its inhabitants. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with editor Wesley LeBlanc writing that "Its hopeful and inspiring message is backed by a branching, heartfelt narrative, and a great gameplay loop, making it tough to put down. Add in its enriching visual style and my favorite musical score of 2022 so far, and Citizen Sleeper is a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." Citizen Sleeper also earned a spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022. 
Citizen Sleeper is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was a Wednesday in March, and the Dreamworks dream team of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen had flown into Seattle to join Bill Gates for a press conference. The four men, seated on tall Hollywood director’s chairs, were estimated to be worth a combined $11 billion - and that was in 1995 money.


Together, Dreamworks and Microsoft were going 50-50 on a new game studio, investing a total of $30 million. “I’m spoiled,” said Spielberg, as recorded by the LA Times. “I worked with the best studios and the best actors, and it would be silly to get into the interactive business without Microsoft. They’re the best company in the world. It does seem like a marriage that was destined to happen.” It was a marriage that would produce a famously strange child in Jurassic Park: Trespasser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Super Mega Baseball franchise is gearing up for its fourth entry to step into the batter's box, and this time, it's bringing a large suite of upgrades and enhancements, likely thanks to its new publisher, EA Sports. Electronic Arts acquired developer Metalhead Studio a year after the launch of Super Mega Baseball 3, meaning that the developer had the benefit of creating this fourth entry with the added resources of its new parent company.
The result appears evident. For the first time in series history, more than 200 legends of the sport (including cover star David Ortiz) are included in the roster alongside the fan-favorite cast of players from the earlier games in the series. You can take the new roster and enjoy the various modes in a variety of ways, including a league of baseball …]]></summary>

That makes it often an aggressively priced SSD compared to others at similar speeds, and today Box are offering the 2TB model for just £77.50. That's the lowest price we've ever seen for a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD and a deal worth writing up, IMO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Midnight Suns may be a turn-based tactics game first and foremost, but it also has a substantial RPG element that drives both the story and the interpersonal dramas of its superhero teams between missions. When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. 
"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie," he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals "we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first sneak peek at the upcoming Gran Turismo movie back in January, and now the film's first full-length trailer provides a better look at PlayStation's latest cinematic adaptation. 
Unlike other many video game movies, Gran Turismo is actually based on real events. The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan. The film follows the teenage Mardenborough's ascension from, as the poster below puts it, gamer to racer and all the trials that come with it. 















	



  
    

  
      
            


      
  













Mardenorough is portrayed by Archie Madekwe and the film also stars David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Djimon Hounsou. Neil Blomkamp sits in the director’s chair. 
Gran Turismo premieres exclusively in theaters on August 11.]]></summary>

I played with couch co-op with two members of developers Toy Logic, which was lighthearted, slightly chaotic fun; everything couch co-op should be, right?
So, I thought I'd give the game a whirl but as a solo player. How would a game built for up to four players cope when there's just one person taking the reins? Well, sort of fine for a bit, then quite agonising, actually. That's not to say it can't be a fun time, but bots definitely aren't a substitute for real people.

This stitching is then scanned into the game by developers Attu Games, creating a uniquely beautiful platformer with a slightly physical touch.

Street Fighter 6 may feature thrilling 1v1 fights, but one of its most exciting features is its World Tour mode. This single-player sandbox story mode is a dramatic shift in what the series has offered, and players recently got to sample a small slice in a recent demo. On a trip to Capcom’s U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, I ventured beyond the demo for a more comprehensive look at what World Tour has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the incredibly rare circumstance that you might have had a Kinder Egg as a kid, was the toy ever your favourite part? It sure wasn’t for me. I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.
In case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.
Writing this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. 
As a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. 
On a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. 
However, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.

We’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a pretty great game that, unfortunately, isn’t running as well as it could be for some players. The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update. 
The PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering" in the patch notes. 
That doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it's worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:
Multiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.
Fixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.
Performance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Fixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis
Fixed various rendering issues.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.
Fixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.
Fixed various collision issues.
Fixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.
Fixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.
Fixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.
Fixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. 
Hopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you’re playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today’s update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Super Mario Bros. Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. 
The film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, and Jurassic World Dominion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. 
Developer poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. 
“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.
If you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. 
Vampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game. You can read our review of Vampire Survivors here.]]></summary>

Original Story: The live-action Twisted Metal TV series got its first poster today, courtesy of IGN, ahead of a teaser trailer scheduled to drop later today. The upcoming adaptation of the classic PlayStation car combat series is set to premiere this July. 
Twisted Metal is being developed by Peacock and stars Anthony Mackie as protagonist John Doe, a “smart ass” delivery driver who transports supplies between settlements in a post-apocalyptic America. He has no memory of his past but gets a chance at a better life by making one special delivery across the dangerous landscape. 
We have the exclusive new poster for @Peacock’s #TwistedMetal show starring Anthony Mackie.

Tonally, the series is billed as an action comedy. Other characters include Sweet Tooth, who will be voiced by Will Arnett and physically performed by pro wrestler Samoa Joe. The cast also includes Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church, Richard Cabral, Tahj Vaughans, and Neve Campbell. The show is being produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and it's the second TV adaptation of a first-party PlayStation game to arrive this year following The Last of Us. 
Twisted Metal premieres on July 27 exclusively on Peacock and consists of 10 half-hour-long episodes. We'll update this story with the teaser trailer when it becomes available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego and Nintendo have announced four new Donkey Kong sets joining the Super Mario lineup. 
Lego has continued to build out its Nintendo universe of sets with Super Mario and now, hot on the heels of The Super Mario Bros. Movie's release in theaters earlier this month, Donkey Kong (a major character in the movie) is joining the lineup. More specifically, four new sets, each available for purchase starting August 1, are coming and they feature Donkey Kong and some of his family members like Cranky, Diddy, Dixie, and Funky. 
Those four sets are Donkey Kong's Tree House Expansion Set, Diddy Kong's Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set, Dixie Kong's Jungle Jam Expansion Set, and Rambi the Rhino Expansion set. 
"The excitement continues to grow for the Lego Super Mario franchise with yet another playful update," Lego Group design director Simon Kent writes in a press release. "We're welcoming the iconic Donkey Kong into the LEGO Super Mario product line. We can't wait to see how the four Expansion Sets inspire kids to discover the new wild and colorful jungle from the Donkey Kong universe, whether that's hanging out in the tree house, riding a mine cart, jamming out with Dixie Kong, or exploring with Rambi." 
Let's break each of these sets down:
Donkey Kong's Tree House Expansion Set
$59.99
555 pieces

Diddy Kong's Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set
$109.99
1157 pieces

Dixie Kong's Jungle Jam Expansion Set
$26.99
174 pieces

Rambi the Rhino Expansion Set
$10.99
106 pieces

All four of these sets will be available from Lego and select retailers on August 1, 2023.

The turn-based anime RPG did exactly that earlier this week, and it's already been downloaded over 20 million times in just a single day, according to a tweet from analyst Daniel Ahmad. Perhaps not surprising for a free-to-play game, but still. That's a lot of people. I must admit, I could never quite gel with Genshin Impact, another very anime RPG made by the same developers, but Honkai's turn-based battles look a lot more up my street. So I downloaded yesterday, which I guess makes me part of that enormous 20 million number. Are you planning on giving it a go as well?

Shardpunk Verminfall is, as Graham reported, an excellent mash-up of several familiar games and concepts, yet doesn't feel like a knockoff of any, or lack its own identity. I would resent it a lot less if it wasn't also a roguelike. Even with its standard mono-save system and unlocking things and "repeating the whole thing from scratch ad infinitum" though, I can't pretend I don't enjoy it anyway.

They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad.

Despite the odd glimmer of joy, like better-than-expected performance on its lowest system requirements, much about playing Jedi: Survivor on Windows suggests it could have used a little more time in the bacta tank. Sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects, and FSR upscaling often fails to deliver a significant performance boost.

Happily, developers Color Gray Games have announced a new DLC pack is coming for The Golden Idol next week called The Spider Of Lanka. Set in 1741, a year before the first scenario of The Golden Idol proper, this trio of new cases looks set to shed extra light on the titular idol whose mysterious powers set the original game in motion. I'm afraid I can't tell you much more than that, as most of the announcement details have been slapped with big black REDACTED marks. Have a watch of the reveal trailer below instead.

And after playing through an hour-long preview build of the team’s next game, the fresly unveiled The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, I can already tell that this adventure is one of their most complex portraits yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game's performance in Unreal Engine 5. 
Layers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games' DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called "The Final Note" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: 


Layers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word "Lumen" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects "to create particle effects in real time" and Action System Controls "to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics," according to a press release. 
"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality," Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. "It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity." 
Layers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software, the developer behind last year's critically acclaimed Elden Ring, announced Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon at The Game Awards 2022. Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it's probably sooner than you expected. 
That's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. 
Check out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. 
The trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: 

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall, the vampire FPS from Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, is out in less than a week and to prepare players for what awaits, the team has released a new launch trailer aptly set to a cover of Soundgarden's "Black Hole Sun." 
It's a nice cover, and it goes quite well with what's happening in Redfall, Massachusetts, as a total eclipse has made it a haven for the game's enemy vampires. The launch trailer itself is more of what you'd expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda. Listen to our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with Redfall after that. 
Redfall launches on Xbox Series X/S and PC next Tuesday on May 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Firaxis first unveiled their new tactical superhero RPG Marvel's Midnight Suns in August of 2021, its card-based battle system proved to be a point of contention among its audience, so much so that when the game was delayed a short while later, rumours started flying that the studio was going back to the drawing board on the game's combat and dropping the cards entirely. 
"Hah, that was wishful thinking for some people!" laughs creative director Jake Solomon when I ask him at GDC how he felt about those rumours at the time. It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps "a little naïve" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't feel very strongly about Age Of Wonders 4. But I’ll be fair; it's definitely good.
I've enjoyed most of my time with it, and the parts I didn't were probably down to caning it too hard in too short a time. Such is that reviewz lyf. Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.
It is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the "cursed toadlings" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Why am I so slow”, complains my partner, minutes into being cajoled into playing Dota 2 for the very first time. “Ah, you’ll need to buy boots,” I say, with the hard earned wisdom of someone who’s spent over 4,000 hours clicking on wizards. “I have boots,” she says, somewhat indignantly. “Those are slippers,” I reply. “What?” she asks, somewhat more indignantly. “They don’t give you move speed,” I respond. I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.


A new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It’s certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. "It's surreal," he says. "For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying."
On the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. 
Solomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently.

Jumping into any 10-year-old game can be intimidating, especially an MMO, but developer Digital Extremes say this is the first story-driven update that’s not progression-locked based on skill level or experience with the game. In other words, this is a new experience within Warframe that’s immediately available to newcomers, while also adding weird cool stuff for old-timers.

Anyway, it's proven to be an excellent way to rinse Vampire Survivors, a game I wouldn't - I have nothing against those who do -  play upright on a monitor. Survival is best served on the couch, curled up like a shrimp with the blood draining from my arms as I hold the TV slab at some atrocious angle.
Anyway, I've come to realise that Vampire Survivors might be a game about running away, but actually peaks when you come to a standstill. There's a special kind of joy to be had when you're able to stop and idle.

It’s now rewound the clocks, available to buy, and as a nice bonus, it’s joined PC Game Pass for the first time since it was previously only available on the console version of the service.

Unlike Zero Dawn’s Frozen Wilds DLC, which was a good but skippable side story, Burning Shores has enough relevant plot advancement to make it closer to required playing.

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?
Well, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor I said it was a competent game that essentially offered Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but more. Playing the full thing reveals I was correct, both for better and for worse, which is why you should never doubt me. Are we done here?
Oh alright. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a third-person action game where you play Cal Kestis in his second rip-roaring adventure across a localised part of the galaxy, fighting both the Empire and a very naughty little Sith, with a flanking attack from Cal's own regrets about getting people killed all the time. Crucially though, at least for the purposes of having fun, Cal has one of those hot glowsticks that goes *whummmmm* and cute robot friend BD-1 - but you will often be deploying both in the effort to get a new pair of trousers.

I thought I'd get that out there right at the start, because you can't really talk about Cassette Beasts without talking a bit about Pokémon. Admittedly, the idea of an open world Pokémon-like might have lost some of its shine now that the actual Pokémon games have finally gone and done it themselves with last year's Scarlet and Violet releases, but Cassette Beasts, the debut game from UK micro team Bytten Studio, is banging a different kind of drum to Nintendo's primo monster catcher.

If the only thought in your mind upon completing 2019’s Jedi: Fallen Order was that you wanted more, then I have excellent news. Picking up where its predecessor left off, Jedi: Survivor isn’t just more of the same but more of virtually everything, with meaningful advances and improvements across the board. It’s a longer game with greater levels of customization, more enemies, more diverse approaches to combat and puzzles, and more storytelling and character development for its compelling cast of characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flashback 2 got a fresh gameplay trailer today showing off the sequel’s modernized graphical facelift as well as a November release window.
The sequel to the influential 1992 adventure game was first announced in 2021, but we haven’t seen much of it since its last teaser at Summer Game Fest last year. Today’s video provides a look at how hero Conrad B. Hart (and his A.I.-powered weapon A.I.S.H.A.) faces off against the shapeshifting aliens known as the Morph once more. Though the action largely retains its 2D roots, the game now sports 3D levels for more depth of movement, especially during firefights. Flashback 2 is helmed by original creator Paul Cuisset alongside the development team at Microids Studio Lyon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. 
More specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. 
As for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. 
Here are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: 
Revenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)
Operating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)
Net income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)
Xbox hardware revenue is down 30%
Xbox content and services revenue is up 3%
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%
These results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has the unenviable task of following what many consider to be one of the greatest games in recent memory. When it launched in 2017, Breath of the Wild revolutionized the longstanding franchise formula in innumerable ways, giving players the biggest world the series has ever featured and mechanics that allowed them to experiment with the game's physics. After spending more than an hour playing some early moments of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the answer to how this game plans on following such a tough act is a bit clearer.

The Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same function as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., has blocked Microsoft's pending $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. 
This news is somewhat shocking, as quite a few experts predicted the CMA would allow the deal to go through, and while this block presents a large barrier to Microsoft's progress forward toward this acquisition, it's not a be-all, end-all for the purchase. Microsoft says it remains dedicated to this acquisition and will appeal the CMA's ruling.

The team is aiming to create "immersive and engaging action-adventure games that offer social and multiplayer experiences," according to a press release. Ehreth, who has more than 20 years of experience as a game director and designer on console and PC games, is joined by a team of industry veterans with experience from Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemption 2, The Division, and more. 

“We’re so excited to officially drop our anchor in Barcelona, the hometown of my great-grandparents, and start building a strong team for our journey of exploration together with NetEase Games," Ehreth writes in the press release. "Our studio’s motto is ‘Per Aspera, Ad Astra’ (‘through hardships, to the stars’) because we want to build an adventure that will stay fresh and provide a unique experience that will surprise and delight people each time they play, and I want us to acknowledge the challenges we are setting out to face. We're grateful to NetEase Games for giving us the creative freedom and resources to build this interconnected world that will expand beyond games and reach into other mediums as well.”

Anchor Point Studios plans to develop action-adventure games for console and PC that "push the boundaries of entertainment and bring elements of surprise into the gameplay."

The studio is based in Barcelona, Spain, but the team will be hiring up to 100 employees across Europe and North America, "seeking developers, technical artists, and designers to work in its offices, remotely, or in a hybrid capacity."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko Fusion, the mash-up co-op action game featuring a bizarre assortment of disparate properties, is the first game from 10:10 Studios. The studio was founded by TT Games veterans like Arthur Parsons, who worked as lead designer on about a dozen of TT Games' Lego games.
The game features Funko characters and worlds from Jurassic World, Back to the Future, The Umbrella Academy, The Thing, Child’s Play 2, Masters of the Universe, and other NBCUniversal properties.


Many of the properties featured in the trailer above are R-rated, and characters lose limbs and heads, use flame throwers, and get eaten by monsters. It never veers into full, non-cartoon violence, but compared to the Lego games the team worked on in the past, Funko Fusion seems like it is going for a more mature audience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has released the first official teaser for its upcoming season of The Witcher alongside the release dates for Volume 1 and Volume 2. 
The Witcher: Season 3 still features Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia but it will be his last season in the role as Netflix announced last year that Liam Hemsworth would be replacing him as the titular Witcher in Season 4. If this new Season 3 teaser is anything to go off of, Cavill's final season as Geralt looks like a great one to go out on. We get a new look at Geralt and what might be his biggest fear, Yennefer and other mainstay characters, and most interestingly, Ciri, who appears to be running from the Wild Hunt, which were the main antagonist of the last mainline Witcher game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Season 3 teaser for Netflix's The Witcher: 


As you can see, this teaser features plenty of teases for what's in store in Volumes 1 and 2 of the series. And speaking of volumes, this season will be the first split season for The Witcher, taking a page out of other Netflix mainstays like Stranger Things. Volume 1 will drop June 29 and Volume 2 will drop roughly a month later on July 27.

Introducing something new to me in action combat is rare. In games that feature it, you’re likely using either guns to kill enemies or melee action to take them down, and I’m not often surprised by how this can work. I can, of course, fall in love with familiar combat despite that, but it’s always exciting to experience something I haven’t before, which is what Strayed Lights manages to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. 
This news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. 


Within that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. 
"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project," the statement reads. 
As you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the "exciting online project" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. 
In terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will "be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine." 
This statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after "an incredible 20 years" there:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HeR Interactive’s The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill are now ready for testing in ScummVM!
The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenTTD 13.0 has been out for two months and we’ve found some bugs to fix. Most notably, we’ve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are proud to announce that network-enabled Humongous Entertainment titles are now playable online! Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.
