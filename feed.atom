Christie has become pretty well-known in recent years thanks in large part to her exceptional role as Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones.

If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A server maintenance for EA FC 24 has been announced today, August 21, which will affect all forms of online matchmaking.


A tweet from EA's official communications handle has announced the impending maintenance. It comes right before the end of the current Ultimate Team season. While the developers haven't announced a reason, it could be in preparation for the new season and upcoming content.


When does the EA FC 24 maintenance (August 21) begin?


Today's maintenance is set to begin at 8 a.m. UTC/1 a.m. PST/4 a.m. EST. It's the same schedule as the one followed during the last maintenance in June. All forms of online matchmaking, including Ultimate Team, will be disabled 30 minutes before the scheduled start.


Today's maintenance will also affect EA FC 24 servers across all platforms.




When does the EA FC 24 maintenance (August 21) end?


As per the announced schedule, today's maintenance will be an affair of six hours. Unless there's any delay, it will end at 2 p.m. UTC/7 a.m. PST/10 a.m. EST. There's always a chance for the maintenance to be extended without prior notice from the developers.


Which game modes will be affected?


Ultimate Team, for starters, will be completely unavailable. Any attempts at matchmaking will result in an error. The same applies to other online modes like FC Clubs. You could play games in offline modes like Career. In Career, you can lead your selected club to glory as a player or a manager.


That said, fans hope there won't be any delay and that matchmaking will return as per the official schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first three games are available now on Switch.
Well, the Gearbox studio head Randy Pitchford wasn't joking around when he recently teased Borderlands 4. At Gamescom Opening Night Live this year, it was revealed the fourth entry would arrive in 2025 on multiple platforms.
Although there's no mention of a Nintendo release, it seems like there's a good chance of one in the future, with the Switch "successor" announcement scheduled to take place at some point "this fiscal year". The original Borderlands trilogy (and even some spin-offs) have also been made available on the Switch during its lifecycle.

Genshin Impact fans waiting for the game to arrive on the Switch have voiced their feelings and thoughts online today after the game was announced for another platform at Gamescom Opening Night Live.
This open-world action RPG adventure is now on its way to the Xbox this November, and yet there are still no updates about the Nintendo version, which was originally confirmed in 2020 - with a trailer at the time noting how it was "coming soon" to the hybrid platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's own action-adventure game Horizon: Forbidden West is strangely leaving the PlayStation Plus Extra lineup next month. What makes it even odder is that only Europeans will be affected by this move. 


While North Americans miss out on playing the Destroy All Humans franchise through PlayStation Plus Extra in September, Europeans are losing multiple highlight games, including Marvel's Midnight Suns, Nier Replicant, and Horizon: Forbidden West. It was shown in the "Last Chance to Play" section of the service.

On the Overwatch subreddit, players were shocked by the decision to give Reaper a skin based off of Anubis over Ramattra, given Ramattra's early design concepts. In a 2017 video, Blizzard shared the concept that ultimately led to Ramattra; an Omnic, wearing Egyptian-styled garb.




Another Developer Update from Blizzard briefly goes over the team's decision to give Reaper the Anubis skin. Lead Concept Artist, Morten Skaalvik, mentions that a meeting was held to discuss who the Mythic Skin should go to.

In Halo Infinite, multiple old favorites return. You can find classic weapons like the Energy Sword and Gravity Hammer, helping the game feel familiar to long-time series fans. However, it also introduces several new weapons such as the Mangler and the Cindershot, which keep the sandbox fresh, even for Halo veterans.

To upgrade your armor though, one of the materials you’re going to need Silk. If you don’t know where to look, this can be an elusive material. Luckily, we’re here to show you how you can get Silk and how to use it. 


Where to find Silk in Black Myth: Wukong


The main way for you to get Silk is by defeating enemies. However, since Silk is a rare drop, you’re not likely to pick up a lot of it in the early game. When you reach Chapter Two, you’ll have much better luck. This is because the enemies drop rarer materials.

As a Maryland native myself, I've always felt like Maryland game studios simply do things differently, and in a good way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Madden NFL 25's Franchise mode, it's possible to play with prospects who are expected to appear in future draft classes.


Thanks to the Team Builder website, which is available to all for free, you can play with custom squads. There are already some wonderful creations themed around them, and some involve future rookies. That said, importing them into a Franchise mode can be tricky if you haven't done it in previous Madden titles.


How to download future draft classes in Madden NFL 25


The Download Center will be your best friend (unless you want to sit and create the entire future draft class).



Start and load the game.


From the main menu, go to the first option under Download Center.


Here, a host of different types of downloads will be available for free. The one you're looking for will be featured as Rosters. 


When I accessed this section, I could already find 2025 and 2026 draft classes with several downloads from the community.


Just select one, and it will be downloaded. You can check this under the "My Downloads" section.



This completes the first part of the task.

How to load future draft classes in Madden NFL 25


For this part, you'll need a new save file.



From the Download Center, go to the last option.


Here, you can load your custom files. Load the one you downloaded with a future draft class.


Create a new Franchise mode save.


Make sure to choose a custom squad instead of using a default one.



This will automatically load your custom squad file containing future draft prospects. Do remember that the community makes all such files. There might be a chance of something going wrong in your save in the future (it might not happen, but fair warning nevertheless).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is oftentimes compared to Soulslikes because of its difficulty and grand bosses, but are there settings to change that? If you want to get into the game but are scared of it potentially being really difficult, here’s what you need to know.


Can you change difficulty settings in Black Myth: Wukong?


Unfortunately, Black Myth: Wukong does not have difficulty setting options at this time. While the game might not be as difficult as Bloodborne, Sekiro, or Elden Ring, it’ll still pose quite the challenge. 


The only way you can really alleviate the game’s difficulty is to farm up levels, or Sparks. Use them to further enhance your character’s abilities and you should hopefully turn the tide in battle against the dozens of bosses you’ll face ahead.


Also, you can skip a handful of bosses if you want, but it’s recommended that you don’t because they drop new items that can help you later down the line. They’ll also drop crafting materials for better gear and give you huge XP boosts upon beating them.


You can also upgrade your abilities like your spells and transformations so that you can deal more damage or have more use out of them, so use all you can if some of these battles are too tough.

Can you summon NPCs or other players in Black Myth: Wukong?


If you were hoping that you could summon an NPC to take the aggro off of you in boss battles, you can’t do that. You’re mostly alone in this game.


With that said, you also can not summon other players via any sort of co-op or multiplayer session. It’s up to you to take on the game with the tools you have.


Since Black Myth: Wukong is solely a single-player game, it can deter many who need a partner or a leg up against these tough bosses. No way are they in the same realm as actual Soulslikes, but they can still be a headache for many.

That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

And, after spending a few hours with its upcoming title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, it looks like we're finally getting that successor, if not even more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devotid has announced that they have partnered with publisher Kwalee to put more resources behind The Coin Game, a strange coin-op simulator that is currently in Early Access.


I wrote an Early Access review of The Coin Game just slightly over a year ago. I can’t possibly stress how bizarre the game is. It started as an attempt of emulating the sort of quarter-chomping prize games that you find in bowling alleys and shopping malls, and then bloomed into an open-world game set on an island of mid-western robot people. You take up side jobs in order to scrape together a bit of cash to spend at the arcades and win tickets. It’s an incredibly atmospheric game that draws you into summer directionlessness.


However, it’s largely been developed by a single person. In a post on Steam, they confess, “As a stubborn do-it-ALL-yourself kind of person that was very hard to face but the game is so much bigger than me now and it had to be done.”


There has been some frustration over the slow development of the game. While the updates that get released always feel meaningful, they don’t come very often. It has felt like Devotid’s personal project that they pluck away at on their own time, and in that way it’s very charming. However, I am interested to see what happens when there’s a bit more horsepower pulling the cart.


There are no announcements beyond the partnership with Kwalee, so it’s uncertain how long it will be to see the fruits of this arrangement. For now, The Coin Game is available on Steam Early Access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's hit show Squid Game continues with its upcoming mobile game, Squid Game: Unleashed. In it, you'll experience the horrors (and maybe wonders?) of the deathly games once the entry arrives to Netflix Games. 


Participate in a 32-player battle royale-style mode featuring the infamous red light, green light game. If you're a fan of the series, you'll undoubtedly recognize Squid Game: Unleashed's many obstacle courses. Put your agility to the test and survive as long as possible to claim the ultimate prize. Currently, there's no release date set, but the Netflix page indicates that it will be "Coming Soon." 




The Squid Game: Unleashed Gamescom 2024 trailer features plenty of deathly scenarios, including getting by bus, rolling ball, and scorching lava. This is not all that surprising, especially since the show has a knack for some gnarly killings. But it'll certainly be more brutal as an actual player of the games.  


The Netflix show also got the green light for the highly anticipated Squid Game Season 2. The new season begins in December, which could be the perfect time for the Unleashed release. Even more so, the finale is already in the works for 2025, ending the battle royale series


If you want to experience the games for yourself, get ready for Squid Game: Unleashed on Netflix Games. It'll be available to play on iOS and Android, which will likely have pre-orders in the near future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The limited release of the inZOI Character Studio is just hours away and will run from August 21 to August 25. You’ll have the chance to make as many characters as you like, get to grips with the incredibly in-depth customization features, and share your creations through Canvas. 


Before you can dive into the Character Studio, though, you’re going to need to set up a Krafton ID in order to log in to Inzoi. This is a relatively straightforward process, and if you’ve ever played any other Krafton games (PUBG or Subnautica, for instance), you’ll likely already have one. 


If you haven’t got a Krafton ID already, you’ll need to follow these steps:



Head over to the Krafton Accounts site and set up a Krafton ID using your email, Google account, Facebook account, or one of the many other options


Once signed up, go to Linked Accounts and link your Steam account to your Krafton ID



When you’ve downloaded the Inzoi Character Studio through Steam, you’ll be able to immediately log in with your Krafton ID and dive straight into making your ideas a reality. 


Image via Krafton


If you’re hoping to upload your realized creations through Inzoi's built-in sharing platform, Canvas, you’ll need to select a separate nickname for the platform. This nickname will be unique to you, and you’ll be able to continue using it upon the full release of Inzoi later this year. 


Inzoi will also hold an event during the time in which the Character Studio is available to play. To be in the running to win unspecified ‘special gifts’, you need to upload your customized Zois to social media using the following three hashtags:



#inZOI 


#CAZ 


#CreateAZoi



Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to fill out this google form, including a link to your social media post, to be entered with a chance to win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “one last thing” at Gamescom Opening Night Live was a reveal for a new game in the Mafia series: Mafia: The Old Country.


Unfortunately, it didn’t tell us much aside from the fact that the game is going set in the early 1900s in Sicily. It’s going to give a look at the birth of the Mafia, so I suppose it could be considered a prequel to the entire series.




Aside from that, there was no gameplay shown. However, I got a press release afterward that says that it will involve “action brought to life by the authentic realism and rich storytelling that the critically acclaimed Mafia series is known for. It promises a “deep, linear narrative with that classic mob movie feeling.”


Honestly, I love Mafia. I got deeply into the first game back in 2002. I enjoyed the second game. I haven’t played the third, but I should since my expectations are set appropriately low. Then Mafia: Definitive Edition is maybe not quite as definitive as the name sounds, but it was a cool revisit to the first game. On a planet where every big budget game seems to be an open-world affair crammed full of side distractions, the more linear narrative of the (first two) Mafia games, where the open world is more of a backdrop, sounds very refreshing.


I'm weirdly hyped over a nothing trailer.


We’re promised that we’ll hear more about Mafia: The Old Country in December 2024. It will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Molyneux, perhaps best known for his work on Fable, Black & White, Dungeon Keeper, and Godus, stepped back into the spotlight during Gamescom 2024's Opening Night Live to reveal his studio's new game, Masters of Albion. 


The game is an homage to everything Molyneux has ever worked on. With the quirky fantasy-meets-history feel of the Fable series crossed with the top-down view and god-like powers bestowed on players from the Dungeon Keeper games. In it, you're tasked with building up a town during the day, deciding everything from where the citizens work and live, to exactly what kind of sandwich they eat. At night, though, you must protect the town from the horrors of Albion, and that's where things get interesting. 


Control it all from the top to the bottom

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Square Enix RPG is one of the best-lookers of this generation, so brace yourself for the Final Fantasy 16 PC system requirements. Even the minimum specs need 16GB of memory and an SSD. 


The minimum Final Fantasy 16 PC system requirements you need


In order to play this epic adventure with Clive and crew, you'll need some beefy PC system requirements just to run the game at 720p with 30 frames per second. The Steam page lists the following:



OS: Windows 10 / 11 64-bit


Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 / Intel Core™ i5-8400


Memory: 16 GB RAM


Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700 / Intel Arc A580 / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 170 GB available space

Final Fantasy 16 is a huge game, so it will require 170GB of available space on an SSD, no less. That is far bigger than another Square Enix game Kingdom Hearts 3, which only requires 75GB. Another action RPG from this generation Wild Hearts also only needed 80GB. 


Final Fantasy 16 recommended specs, listed


To play Final Fantasy 16 with 60 frames per second at a 1080p resolution, you'll need the following specs in your PC:



OS: Windows® 10 / 11 64-bit


Processor: AMD Ryzen™ 7 5700X / Intel® Core™ i7-10700


Memory: 16 GB RAM


Graphics: AMD Radeon™ RX 6700 XT / NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2080


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 170 GB available space



If you need to test your rig and see if the game will work on your PC, there's thankfully a free demo available on Steam. It contains the first few hours of the experience, and you can carry on your save progress into the full game. Neat! Hopefully, your PC won't need a Phoenix Down after running (or attempting to run) Final Fantasy 16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Indiana Jones and the Great Circle releases later this year, one thing is for sure: The Great Circle will certainly encompass a genuine rendition of Indiana Jones. During today's Gamescom Opening Night Live, developer MachineGames and publisher Bethesda Softworks showed off various elements of gameplay and confirmed the action adventure title will release on Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, 2024 as a timed console exclusive before coming to PS5 in Spring 2025.




For the first time, we got an extensive look at the gameplay that will take place in the all-new handcraft Indiana Jones story coming in The Great Circle. At its core, the name of the game in The Great Circle will be stealth. Often times it looks as though there will be plenty of enemies between Indy and his destination, making the quiet unseen route the safest and most reliable option. But when things get hairy, Indy will have options.


Using his signature trusty whip, players will be able to smack around, disoriented, crowd control, and subdue enemies. Every location will also have a variety of objects that the player can interact with and use to assist them in combat as well, ranging from actual weapons including firearms to random knick-knacks to throw at the enemy.


Based on the trailer, it looks as though we'll be exploring a variety of detailed environments and solving interesting puzzles to crack the code of The Great Circle.


Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release on December 9, 2024 on Xbox Series X|S and PC. It will later release on PS5 in Spring 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

Okomotive has a penchant for chill, atmospheric games set in a suggested post-apocalyptic landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what will likely be the most memorable moment of Gamescom Opening Night Live, a very emotional Tim Miller, co-founder of Blur Studios and director of Deadpool, has shown of footage of the upcoming Amazon Prime video game anthology series, Secret Level. This is coming so fast, but I definitely saw Mega Man in there.


Secret Level is supposedly a series of original short narratives set around various video games. It’s an incredibly eclectic mix including Armored Core, Sifu, and Spelunky alongside more mainstream stuff like Concord and God of War. Maybe also Pac-Man.


There's also Mega Man, but he's doing that really cliche gear-up sequence. Like, it's so ubiquitous that Doom Eternal even opened with it.




I am entirely unable to process what’s going on. I’m not sure if there’s some sort of metanarrative here. As I mentioned, it’s reportedly going to be a series of short narratives (via Deadline), but the sizzle reel doesn’t exactly clarify that.


The introduction by Tim Miller was especially interesting. I mentioned to my colleagues that he sounded like he was on the verge of tears before he seemed to break further and admit his emotions. Some sounded cynical about the sincerity, but as a prolific crier, it seemed genuine. Listen, it’s sometimes easy to get emotional about stuff. I can cry pretty easily on some days. Dude might just really love showing off his team’s efforts.


Secret Level airs December 10, 2024 on Amazon Prime.

While Shattered Space isn't quite here yet, you won't have to wait long for its release, as it's coming out at the end of September this year.




Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024 revealed that Starfield will receive a free content update tonight that introduces the REV-8 space vehicle, allowing you to drive around the universe in style. It's completely separate from the expansion, so anyone who owns Starfield will get access to it. The REV-8 also features flying capabilities, a mounted turret, and armor to make combat easier. You can even drive around with companions to make space travel a little less lonely.


Bethesda also revealed during Gamescom that the Shattered Space expansion will launch on September 30, 2024. While it was known that it'd be released sometime in Fall 2024, this is the first time the exact launch date was revealed. Considering Starfield was released in September 2023, Shattered Space launching shortly after the game's one-year anniversary sounds fitting. Anyone who purchased Starfield's Premium or Constellation Editions will have access to the expansion, with premium upgrades available for anyone who wants to experience it.


As of now, details on other future Starfield expansions and free content updates are unknown. While we know more expansions are coming beyond Shattered Space, information about their content, prices, and release dates remains to be discovered.

The title looks similar to the Little Nightmares games but has a distinctly new and much more terrifying series of monsters to avoid. 


While we were only shown a brief glimpse of Reanimal, it was enough to demonstrate exactly what the gameplay looks and feels like. Players take on the role of two tiny characters a brother and sister duo, and find themselves lost in a world where creatures much bigger than them lurk. They must constantly run, hide, duck, cover, sneak, crawl, and evade colossal, strangely altered animals in order to find some sort of small sense of safety while being constantly hunted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the first gameplay trailer.
We were more than a bit surprised when Sid Meier's Civilization VII was confirmed to be coming to Switch at Summer Game Fest 2024. And at Gamescom, we found out when we can expect to play the game on all consoles — 11th February 2025.
Debuting alongside the release date was the first-look at the gameplay, nd it looks absolutely stunning. Of course, we don't have Switch footage yet — and we're sort of staggered that they'll be able to squeeze the game onto the console — but hopefully it'll look nice on the hybrid console. Well, we'll find out early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Gamescom Opening Night Live, developer and publisher NetEase confirmed that upcoming Free to Play Hero Shooter Marvel Rivals officially has a release date. Marvel Rivals will release on December 6, 2024 on Steam, Epic Game Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.




The Overwatch-inspired superhero team-based PvP shooter allows players to choose from a roster of Marvel Heroes and jump into 6v6 combat across a handful of landmark battlefields from the Marvel cinematic universe.


Marvel Rivals recently had a rather successful playtest, creating a lot of buzz around the fact that there is finally a potential competitor to Overwatch. Our very own Eric Van Allen got some playtime with the hero shooter and felt that while it wasn't necessarily revolutionary, it could put some pressure on Overwatch.


All heroes will be unlocked and free-to-play "at launch and beyond" which is certainly great news for fans looking forward to dabbling in some Marvel madness.


Those interested in Marvel Rivals can jump in when it launches on December 6, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its initial release date nearly four years ago, Genshin Impact has developed a massive following on PC, mobile, and PlayStation, with no signs of slowing down. If you know about this famous gacha game but never got the chance to play it, you'll now have another opportunity to with its release on Xbox consoles on November 20. For those on other platforms, you'll get to dive into the new region of Natlan soon, too.


During the Gamescom Opening Night Live stream on August 20, MiHoYo revealed that Genshin Impact will launch on Xbox series X/S and Xbox One on November 20, 2024. You'll have three months to decide whether to swap platforms or try it for the first time.




Even sooner than that, Genshin Impact's sixth nation, Natlan, will become available on August 28, giving everyone on PlayStation, PC, and mobile a chance to dive deep into a new region in just over one week. Like previous region updates, it'll come with its own set of resources, bosses, and quests to complete. During the trailer, we also get a chance to meet Mualani, Kachina, and Kinich, who'll all be future playable characters during and after the update. 


Xbox players won't quite have a chance to access this new area on launch, but at least it'll be available for the November release. 


Genshin Impact's Natlan region will be available on August 28, 2024, and the game will launch on November 20 for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Gamescom Opening Night Live, developer Firaxis Games and publisher 2K Games revealed the release date for the upcoming grand strategy title Sid Meier's Civilization VII as February 11, 2025. That means that it will be just over eight years between Civilization 6 and the upcoming entry into the series, Civilization 7.




Visually, Civilization 7 certainly looks improved while still keeping its classic semi-cartoony aesthetic. The city development weaved around the terrain looks better than ever, as do the various units and combat seen in the trailer.


The Standard Edition will cost $69.99 while a Deluxe Edition is available for $99.99 that grants five days of Early Access to Civilization 7, allowing players to get into the game on February 6. The Switch version for each edition will run $10 cheaper.


Sid Meier's Civilization VII will be released on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on February 11, 2025.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

It's safe to say that King of Meat has sprung out of nowhere. Developed by Guildford-based studio Glowmade and published by Amazon Games, it was one of the genuinely new announcements in Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, and you may be wondering what exactly it has in store.
We were in the same boat when we were invited by the publisher to a preview event earlier this month. But, after watching the trailer, hearing from the developer, and getting to go hands-on for roughly two hours, we're starting to build up a pretty good picture of what it's all about.

We've been waiting for news of Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh on Switch for a while now (ever since it was first teased back in 2022, to be precise), but it looks like we won't have to wait too much longer. Publishers Tintinimaginatio and Microids have finally revealed that the detective's latest adventure will be flying over to Switch on 17th October 2024.
The game launched on PlayStation and Xbox last year in a pretty sorry state (one that developer Pendulo Studios apologised for on release day), though the announcement of the Switch release comes with a glimmer of hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

As an M-rated game being published by Nintendo, there's certainly been a lot more interest in Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club in the lead-up to its release than there might have been with a more...well, Nintendo-esque content rating attached.
Whether it deserves the full-blown adult treatment, we've yet to discern as we've only had time with the prologue and first chapter so far, which you too should have access to at the time of writing via the multipart demo hitting the Switch eShop. But what we can say, is that this is an intriguingly dark game from the get-go whilst still remaining something that long-time fans of the Famicom Detective Club series should feel right at home playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best roguelikes on PC is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost two years after Radiohead released 'In Rainbows' as a pay-what-you-like album, the track 'These Are My Twisted Words' leaked on private torrent site What.cd. Many believed that the band itself was responsible, something we highlighted in our August 2009 article. Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak's 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.

We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable RPGs, from Baldur's Gate to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 


Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am forever looking for a game to replace Transport Tycoon (or OpenTTD) in my affections. I know there are several railway management sims kicking around Steam, but I haven't found the one that does it for me yet. Could it be Railroad Corporation 2? It's a train tycoon game in which you lay tracks through the early 20th century, and it's launching in Early Access on September 9th.

Let's Build A Dungeon marries the business aspects of Game Dev Tycoon with a more hands-on approach to constructing your company's game, and there's a first trailer below.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

Also, Trevor’s been banging on about lady Custodes for five months straight and nobody wants to be around him right now. Thank the Omni-trevor, then, for the three-player co-op of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “Warhammer with the boys?” said Horace as he stretchily dished out preview keys from an entirely different postcode.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam’s seeing a good few sweeping changes of late. They’ve recently added a ‘Trending Free’ tab to separate the no money down and no, money down playables. And, as of September, they’re cracking down on links to other websites in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!

After being raided five years ago, two brothers from Ilford in Essex have been sentenced to prison. Whether both will actually see the inside of a cell is unclear; one turned up to face the music, the other failed to appear. The reason for his absence is unknown and just the start of a long list of other unanswered questions.

Today is their day. We have lined up these racing games on a starting grid and are interested to see how things shake out. Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets? Or perhaps a nippy arcade crowd-pleaser will soar to the finish line, propelled by the sound of roaring cheers. It's all to play for here at our incredibly messed-up grand prix with a worrying lack of rules or regulation.

If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crimson Diamond is a proper old-school style puzzle adventure. It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

The platform's servers were targeted in a police raid just months after a French court ordered ISPs to block the site. Uptobox tried to reverse this decision, arguing that it's not the piracy haven rightsholders make it out to be, but the court denied that challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Games like Maelstrom, Ambrosia's Macintosh clone of Asteroids, and the proto-shmup Crystal Quest from Patrick Buckland, who would go on to make Carmageddon. Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

They can’t hurt you. They’re actually known for not being able to move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

The "Crush Depth" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

This week, I’ve been half reading in the garden and half staring in awe at my Kindle’s paperwhite doohickey and it’s ability to stay readable in searing sunbeams. I’m tempted to look up how it works but I don’t want to find out it’s made from the luminous, genetically-engineered husks of the workers that drop dead from dehydration at the fulfilment centers or something. To help distract me with yet more books, it’s Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider writer and Destiny 2 senior narrative designer, Dr. Hazel Monforton! Cheers Hazel!

I know it's the first time I've made you aware of this project, but it's been going on since I moved to Glasgow. So far, Lidl's own brand remains the clear winner, a solid 8 on the taste meter at just 59p. But while writing this, I'm sipping an "Intenso" Arctic Coffee from Morrisons, which is giving the Lidl frontrunners some stiff competition at last, albeit at 145% the cost. Will one true victor emerge? Find out next week! For now, here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it's not because I'm a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it's not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WolfEye's debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored's immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I'll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…
