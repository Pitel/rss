Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.

Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the Garry's Mod machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.

Garry's Mod open sandbox model unfortunately renders the game liable to such situations, as we'd previously seen with Nintendo, but this case is stranger for a few reasons; namely, Skibidi Toilet's creator Dafuq?Boom! claims he was unaware of the strike. 


Though he claims not to know the exact origin of the strike, Boom!'s made a statement on his Discord channel explaining that the DMCA action isn't related to anything new, but to a situation that arose in 2023.

Picking the right feats for your Druid means understanding your playstyle, and that’s why I should preface this list with my own biases. I tend to find pleasure in the simple things, like the image of an owlbear smacking a goblin directly in the face. My Druids don’t have much time to cast epic spells, because I make them shift into a bear, or a dinosaur when possible, and smash into everything in sight. My favorite feats tend to boost that melee-heavy approach, but I’ve included some feats for Druids that want to flex their spellcasting muscles and some honorable mentions that should appeal to everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selecting a 1-star rated school in College Football 25's Dynasty Mode can be one of the hardest challenges for any player.


In sports games like FC 24, the star rating is a simple reflection of how good the squad is. In Dynasty Mode, all schools have a certain prestige level, which is symbolized by the stars. This creates an interesting scenario: there are schools with reasonably good squads, but their programs aren't good enough. As the head coach, it will be in your hands to gradually improve the prestige level with consistent performances on the field.


10 Best 1-star projects to take in College Football 25 Dynasty Mode


For starters, the list contains schools with a prestige level of either one or one-and-half stars. There are 46 such schools available in the default database. When choosing the best project, I have favored those with exact one-star rated prestige levels and the quality of their existing squads (OVR, OFF, and DEF).

Picking a school with a one-star prestige level won't be an easy job. The star rating reflects a composite average of the grades associated with different aspects of the program. While you can improve them with time, you'll need to win matches. Doing so with an average squad isn't always easy.


Then again, the teams on this list offer a different kind of challenge to College Football 25 players. While you can select one of the top-tier schools and dominate the Dynasty Mode, who doesn't love a romantic underdog story?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports has revealed the name of Madden NFL 25's top 10 running backs (RBs), and we have our second entrant to the 99-rating club.


Cover icon and San Francisco star Christian McCaffrey is the best RB in this year's game. It was widely expected that McCaffrey could grab the top position, following his selection as this year's cover icon by EA Sports. Not only has he secured the top spot, but his 99 OVR rating makes it a special occasion for him. Along with McCaffrey, nine other superstars are also present on the list. 


10 best RBs in NFL Madden 25


For now, I have used the OVR rating as the parameter to decide how good an RB will be in the game. You'll also have to pay attention to the key stats, which will determine how they perform on the field.

Unlike the top 10 names in the WR position, there's a noticeable gap between the 10 best RBs in Madden NFL 25. Based on overall ratings, Nick Chubb has grabbed the second position with a rating of 96, while Derrick Henry is the third name with an overall of 94.




Incidentally, McCaffrey isn't the quickest member on this list, as that award goes to Kenneth Walker III, who has 94 Speed. It will be interesting to find out which other attributes for the RB position will be important after the implementation of Boom Tech and Physics-based movements.

Need to hear some excellent new music for the upcoming Sonic X Shadow Generations? Sega has you covered today, as the developer has shared a new remix from the upcoming game.
The new track is a remix of Kingdom Valley, one of Shadow's levels from the much-maligned Sonic the Hedgehog (or Sonic 06 as it's often referred to). While the quality of that game may be disparaged, almost everyone can agree that the music is absolutely phenomenal. And this new remix from Audissi Studios does a fantastic job at reimagining the track for the stage's return in Sonic X Shadow Generations.

Vampire Survivors led to the bullet-hell bonanza, Dota Auto Chess spawned its fair share of imitators, and there was certainly no shortage of hero-shooters in the wake of Overwatch.


In that respect, Marvel Rivals almost feels a bit late to the party. Overwatch lit the world on fire back in 2016, eight years that feels like an eternity today. We've seen games like Paladins, Gigantic, and Lawbreakers all put spins on it already, followed by discourses about whether similar shooters like Apex Legends or Valorant were going to cut into Overwatch's base. Hell, we got Overwatch 2.


Yet Marvel Rivals, and a few other games like Concord, seem confident that the bell hasn't rung yet. They might even be …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long gone are the days when a game is released and no further support, be it additional content or maintenance, is offered. When it comes to the likes of The First Descendant and its looter shooter ilk, weekly maintenance is typically a known quantity. Even knowing this, it can be hard to track down exactly when maintenance is going to take place. So, just when is maintenance for The First Descendant?


What time is The First Descendant's weekly maintenance?


For the upcoming Week 5 Patch, The First Descendant servers will be down from 3 a.m. ET to 8 a.m. ET on July 31, 2024. 


At the time of this writing, The First Descendant doesn't have a dedicated weekly maintenance window. Unlike other studios, Nexon typically doesn't announce upcoming maintenance on its site or X account. Instead, it opts to publish the information on its official Discord server.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The prior week's patch was also on a Wednesday whereas the two weeks before were on Thursdays and the first week's maintenance was on Wednesday. While many games, especially those in the live service space, have a dedicated window, it's still unclear if Nexon will move towards that or continue to play it fast and loose.


There are pros and cons to this style of maintenance. On the one hand, there's no dedicated downtime that players can anticipate and play around, like in Destiny 2 or World of Warcraft on Tuesdays. On the other hand, Nexon has shown a willingness to patch The First Descendant far quicker than most games. This, in itself, is also a double-edged sword as both bugs and unintentional farms, like the Valby run, can be quickly taken care of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard revealed the official title and release date for Season 5 of Diablo 4 today. Titled the Season of Infernal Hordes, Diablo 4 Season 5 will kick off in just one week on August 6 at 1 p.m. EST. In the Season of the Infernal Hordes, players will tackle a new wave-based feature called the Infernal Hordes to earn powerful seasonal rewards.




Face the Infernal Hordes


Each Season for Diablo 4 typically revolves around a seasonal mechanic, with Season of the Infernal Hordes revolving around a new wave-based feature where players can take on hordes of enemies either solo or with friends. In between each wave, Infernal Offerings, which augment future waves with boons or banes, can be chosen to increase wave difficulty while also increasing potential rewards.


After each Infernal Hordes run, players will take on 3 of the 5 members of the Fell Council, each with their own unique abilities that can create interesting combinations based on other members of the Fell Council joining them in the fight.


Also part of the new Infernal Hordes seasonal mechanic are the all-new Hellbreach Dungeons. These new dungeons grant Burning Aether throughout that can then be spent to open unique chests at the end of the dungeon.


Even though the Infernal Horde feature is the main point of the new season, over 50 new Unique and Legendary Items are also being added the season, adding some new unique build variety and possibilities.


Diablo 4 Season 5, Season of the Infernal Hordes is set to launch on all platforms on August 6.

        <updated>2024-07-30T17:34:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some believe that when you die, that's it. Lights out. Others believe there's an afterlife, and sometimes that afterlife needs a cloaked cat to keep it clean. The latter theory holds water in Crypt Custodian, a top-down Metroidvania that hits PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on August 27. 


You can see a sample of its broom-bashing gameplay in a new release date trailer:




When a mischievous cat named Pluto dies, their subsequent meeting with the Afterlife Guardian doesn't go so well. Rather than being treated to a relaxing afterlife, Pluto is sentenced to be the janitor of the afterworld for the rest of eternity. Thankfully, it seems as if Pluto might be up to the task, thanks to the power of beating up monsters with a broom. 


It also looks like there are some other weapons and upgrades to help Pluto along the way, like the Broomerang Dash ability showcased in the trailer. It's one of those fun traversal powers that lets you toss something and then dash to its position. You can mix and match upgrades throughout, and use new abilities to open up more of the world in classic Metroidvania fashion. 


It's all held together with what appears to be a pretty lively style and some big bosses to contend with. Developer Kyle Thompson (Islets, Sheepo)—who makes Metroidvanias with his brother Eric handling the music—is bringing Crypt Custodian to life with publisher Top Hat Studios. Hopefully, their adventure is as simple and clean as it looks.

After all, taking damage is inevitable no matter how skilled you are, and being able to get your shields and health back can be the difference between a win and a loss. While you may already be familiar with shield potions and medkits, Med-Mist is one of the most powerful healing items you can use, especially if you play in squads mode.


Where to find Med-Mist in Fortnite


Med-Mist is an uncommon-grade item found as chest loot, floor loot, and drops from other players. Like weapons, shield potions, and other consumables, it can be randomly found around the Fortnite map as you play your matches.

This Lois Openda card is pretty cheap to acquire, and offers four playstyle+. It has 99 Pace, 93 Shooting, and 93 Dribbling (both Shooting and Dribbling require a boost). While the card is cheap, it's just not good enough. The distribution of the playstyle+ could have been better as well, and it has just 4* Skills. The Openda FUTTIES card is best suited for beginners, as there are plenty of more powerful striking options available in Ultimate Team.

Before the June Direct came along, we were starting to think that 2024 would be the year of remakes and remasters on Switch. We had Another Code: Recollection, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD already banked and that was before Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (releasing in 2025) was added to the pile. Sure, new titles like Echoes of Wisdom and Mario & Luigi: Brothership left things looking a little brighter, but, like it or not, as the Switch keeps chugging through its eighth year, Nintendo is clearly relying on the old faithful to tide us over until new hardware.
It's no surprise, of course. Game development is no walk in the park, and despite the Switch's undoubtedly impressive library, there are still a handful of classics that are yet to make the jump to the hybrid console *cough Wind Waker cough*. It's the way that most Nintendo consoles go in their senior years, but these late-life lineups have historically been counterbalanced by a 'Nintendo Selects' range, a chance for owners to catch up on some of the console's bestsellers at a reduced price.

Farming out these Scrips may seem like a tall order, especially if you consider the fact that these books cost over 1,000 Scrips each. However, there are some hints and tips that I’ve picked up to make the grind a little easier. 


One basic tip before getting into this: I urge you to do your weekly Custom Deliveries, and also complete the Wachumeqimeqi Deliveries quests. These both provide a large number of Purple Scrips, and at relatively little effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus launched to generally solid reviews on July 18, but those playing the hand-drawn action platformer on consoles will have to wait longer for any post-launch updates. Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden closure of publisher Humble Games has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game. 


In a statement posted to Twitter, Squid Shock Studios states that Humble Games' apparent closure last week, which saw its entire 36-person staff laid off by owner Ziff Davis in what it calls a “restructuring,” has adversely affected its ability to provide post-launch support for the console versions of Bō. The studio states that this is due to the game’s porting and QA support being tied to its deal with Humble. The PC version doesn't appear to be affected, with the studio currently working on updates for that version. Here’s Squid Shock Studios’ full statement:

Given the number of games Humble published, both released and upcoming, this likely isn’t the only game or studio to have this kind of wrench thrown into the works due to the sudden layoffs. If you're planning on picking up Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, PC seems like the best way to go for the foreseeable future. 
Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is inspired by Japanese folklore, with players controlling a warrior named Bō who descends from Heaven to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Armed with his shapeshifting Bō staff, players traverse a dreamlike, Metroidvania-inspired world battling monsters. Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sweep it up.
Fancy cleaning up the afterlife? The Crypt Custodian, the latest Metroidvania from solo developer Kyle Thompson should be on your radar. Today, publisher Top Hat Studios has revealed that the game will be launching on Nintendo Switch, alongside other platforms, on 27th August 2024 for $19.99.
Thompson's previous two games — Sheepo and Islets — both proved to be excellent takes on the Metroidvania genre, and Crypt Custodian looks to build upon that knowledge. From the premise alone, you can already tell the game is quirky, cute, and heartwarming; you're playing as a deceased cat (called Pluto) who is sentenced to being the afterworld's janitor. But after befriending some ghosts, Pluto discovers that there may be a treasure hidden in the afterlife that will allow him to speak with the living.

Earlier this year, I flew to Malmö, Sweden, to get an exclusive first look at Star Wars Outlaws for our cover story. During that time, I played through an hour of early-game content, spoke with various members of the developers, and dove deep into the approach the studio behind The Division took when crafting its adventure in the galaxy far, far away. Several months have passed since my trip out to Sweden, and with Ubisoft hosting one final preview event prior to the game's August 30 release date, I traveled to Irvine, California, to get my hands on a longer section of the game.

Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.

Take the new Steam Tower Defense Fest as a prime example, live now.


This year's Steam Tower Defense Fest isn't a major unknown at all. In fact, as long as you're even remotely familiar with the niche of tower defense games, you should have a pretty solid idea of what's up right off the bat. Basically, you can enjoy substantial discounts on most anything even remotely related to the idea of tower defense titles, and the really neat part is that you get to do so all the while making ample use of Steam's all-new demo policy, adding even more functionality to this fea…]]></summary>

Quidditch Champions PC requirements - minimum specs


In order to feel the magic with Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions on PC, you'll need the following minimum specs, according to Steam:



OS: Windows 10


Processor: Intel Core i7-4790 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X


Memory: 8 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960, 4 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7950, 3 GB or Intel Arc A380, 6 GB


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 15 GB available space



These PC specs will let you run the game in Low settings at 1080p resolution. You could possibly raise the settings even further at 720p resolution if you'd like to. It's cool that this game only needs 15GB of storage, especially when compared to other sports titles like NBA 2K24 (110GB) and FC 25 (100GB)


Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions recommended specs


To run the game to how the developer Unbroken Studios recommends, you'll need the specs listed here:



OS: Windows 10


Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600X


Memory: 8 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, 3 GB or AMD Radeon R9 290X, 4 GB or Intel Arc A750, 8 GB


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 15 GB available space



If you manage to cast Accio on a Radeon R9 290X or higher, you should be able to run the game on High settings with a 1080p resolution. Thankfully, the Quidditch Champions PC requirements don't require too much of an investment, and it doesn't seem like it needs an SSD. It's likely to open up more players to the game when it releases this September.

Kirara creates a shield with her Skill, and it’s actually quite strong if you build for it. Here’s what you need to make your Kirara a bulky, flexible shield support unit in Genshin Impact.

First, equip any HP or Energy Recharge weapon. Key of Khaj-Nisut has the highest HP stat of any Sword in Genshin Impact, but it’s not worth it to pull a 5-star weapon for Kirara. Instead, I recommend The Dockhand’s Assistant (if you happen to have it) or Favonius Sword.

Strongest Metaphors for the Illusive Realm in Wuthering Waves


The best Metaphors in the Illusive Realm largely depend on the character you play in the content. In order to win, you need to balance both Offensive and Defensive choices, with offense being the most important due to the presence of the timer. Generally speaking, these will provide the biggest bang for your buck.

Epyx Rogue, the game that effectively helped coin the term 'roguelike', is now available on the Nintendo Switch eShop for a paltry £7.99 / $7.99, and while this would normally be cause for celebration, it seems as though some players have noticed a severe bug that effectively soft-locks the game.
To start with the positive, however, Rogue is a remarkable game that, if the opening paragraph didn't give it away, had a massive influence on the medium after its launch in the '80s. An Amiga port launched in 1986 and this version of the Switch seems to be a direct port of that specific release.

Look, I've been a fan of Starfield since day one, even though it's certainly privy to a set of very questionable faults. Arguably the biggest of these faults is the fact that even though Starfield plays host to a substantial number of unique points of interest, nothing about them is actually random or procedurally generated short of their placement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visions of Mana is a month away from release, but anxious players can get an early taste starting today, thanks to a free demo. Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.
The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley. 


Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance. 
First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here. 
Visions of Mana launches on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.]]></summary>

Peel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo.

Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.

Although pricing for this new statue hasn't been revealed yet, the Varia Suit statue is currently available for $164.99 (in the collector's edition) and $181.49 (in the exclusive edition).

Supermassive announced Pankhurst's passing on Twitter. A tribute page from Pankhurst’s family (spotted by GameSpot) reveals that he died on May 9 and his funeral was held on June 7. The family is currently accepting donations to Hospice in the Weald, who cared for Pankhurst during his final weeks.

Pankhurst’s career in the entertainment industry spans over 40 years across films, TV, and radio. In video games, he provided the likeness for the mysterious Curator in The Dark Pictures Anthology games Man of Medan, Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me, although actor Pip Torrens provided the voice and motion capture for the character.

You don’t know who you are, you don’t know fully why you’re going where you’re going, and everyone around you just assumes you’re the solution to all their problems. You could argue that this idea describes an unusually vast number of games, but Thank Goodness You’re Here! takes that notion to its logical conclusion.
You play as (as far as we were able to tell) an entirely unnamed yellow man, whose most distinguishing feature is that his size changes in reaction to the situation, almost always diminishing. You’re shown a series of ads from the fictitious Yorkshire town of Barnsworth by your presumed employer and sent off to speak to its mayor. Why? Well, it’s not your place to ask, lad. Nowt to do but ge’ tumblin’ ah’ window soon as game should allow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, we learned Sega and Amazon had partnered to create a live-action series based on the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series. Over the weekend, during the San Diego Comic-Con, the studio unveiled the first teaser trailer. 
Like A Dragon: Yakuza centers on Kazuma Kiryu (played by Takeuchi Ryoma) and follows his life during two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Set in the series’ fictional Tokyo district of Kamurochō, the trailer’s synopsis states the show “depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people” and will explore stories the games haven’t been able to. 


The six-episode series will be released on Prime Video in two parts, with the first three episodes premiering on October 24 and the last three arriving on November 1. It will be subbed and dubbed in 30 languages. Like a Dragon: Yakuza is directed by Take Masaharu (100 Yen Love).

Nintendo's latest remaster has slid down to fifth this time, with the behemoths of Hogwarts Legacy, EA Sports FC 24 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe climbing above it. The 'Lovestruck' expansion for The Sims 4 has also made the podium in its first week, grabbing second place and becoming the only new release in the top 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Games Fest gave us the cinematic reveal of Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, an upcoming game based on the popular wizarding sport. A new trailer provides the first look at gameplay, including glimpses of a couple of modes and character customization. 
Quidditch Champions features a single-player career mode that allows players to climb the ranks of the sport. Each victory takes them to larger, grander venues, from Hogwarts to the Quidditch World Cup Stadium. An online competitive mode pits teams of real-life players against each other. Playable characters include Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Draco Malfoy, but you can also create and customize your own athletes using an extensive character creator. 


Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions launches digitally on September 3 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. A Switch version is planned to launch sometime this holiday. 
Quidditch Champions will be available in two versions. The Digital Standard Edition ($29.99) simply includes the base game. Digital and Physical Deluxe Editions ($39.99) include the game, House Packs for Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor, and 2,000 in-game gold (earned in-game, as Quidditch Champions does not have microtransactions). The house pack includes a broom skin, travel school uniform, and crest emblem representing each house. The Physical Deluxe Edition goes on sale on November 8. 
Additionally, the Standard Edition will launch as a PlayStation Plus title on day one and will be available to subscribers until September 30.]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.nintendolife.com/#article-169239</id>
        <link href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-new-denpa-men"/>
        <updated>2024-07-29T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A winner is you.
Back in the days of the Nintendo 3DS eShop, some of you may remember the Denpa Men trilogy, which offered a series of cheap and approachable RPG adventures that felt like a great fit for the portable. However, there was a fourth title released only in Japan in 2014 which experimented with a free-to-play structure that proved reasonably popular. That game died with the ending of online services for the 3DS, so Genius Sonority has seen fit to retool it for the Switch era and release it worldwide as The New Denpa Men. It may not be one of the best free-to-play games available on Switch, but New Denpa Men still proves to be modestly enjoyable.
The narrative in New Denpa Men is hardly in line with the epic and occasionally drawn-out stuff that JRPGs are known for. Here, you command an army of Denpa Men—charmingly weird little dudes that look like a cross between a Mii and a Teletubby—to go on various quests geared towards helping various cutesy yellow creatures with long noses. The episodic structure works well with the bite-sized gameplay design, though it must be said that the localization here is NES-era levels of atrocious. Yet funnily enough, the broken English honestly adds to New Denpa Men’s quirky charm, as it feels strangely in line with the awkward vibe of the characters and world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.
In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.

Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.

Thus far, Eyeo GmbH, the company behind Adblock Plus, has come out on top. However, with Axel Springer's reformulated claims now rooted firmly in copyright law, the stakes are high at Germany's highest court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the AMD Zen 5 generation, the timing is interesting where it's not the desktop processors launching first but happens to be in the form of AMD Ryzen AI 300 series laptops. With the last minute delay of the Ryzen 900 series by 1~2 weeks, the embargo lift for the Ryzen AI 300 series is timed for this Sunday morning where I can now present the first AMD Zen 5 Linux benchmark results. And with being the first Zen 5 chip in my lab, I have been pushing it hard... Here is an extensive look at the ASUS Zenbook S 16 I received with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 current flagship SoC compared to a variety of other AMD and Intel laptop models. The focus was on both the raw performance and the package performance-per-Watt for the overall power efficiency of this Zen 5 SoC. And with it being the first Zen 5 hardware in the lab, I didn't limit the selection to just conventional laptop workloads but also explored the performance characteristics for various other workloads of interest to diverse Linux users and for an idea of the HX 370 potential or similar Zen 5 chips appearing in thin client / edge / IoT type devices. This initial taste of AMD Zen 5 has me extremely excited about the performance potential of the upcoming Ryzen 9000 series and EPYC Turin processors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s much-anticipated story expansion has been revealed, and it’s called Khaos Reigns. It unfolds after the events of the story campaign and centers on the invasion of Titan Havik from an alternate reality, who seeks to spread anarchy across all timelines.
The expansion's cinematic story introduces new playable characters, Noob Saibot and the now female Sektor and Cyrax. These three fighters make up half of Kombat Pack 2 and will be available when the DLC launches on September 24. 
In keeping with the tradition of prior games, the second half of Kombat Pack 2 features guest fighters from various films. Scream’s Ghostface, Terminator 2’s T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian are on the way, but there’s no release window for their arrival. Kombat Pack 2 comes included with Khaos Reigns and cannot be purchased as a standalone character bundle. 


Animalities are making their return as a free content update upon Khaos Reigns’ release. First introduced in Mortal Kombat 3, these beastial finishing moves see fighters morph into animals to eviscerate opponents. The trailer reveals Mileena can turn into a giant, horrifying praying mantis, for example, and a press release states every playable fighter will have an Animality (which would include the movie-born guest fighters for an interesting thought). 
Speaking of free content, today, owners will receive the MK95 Scorpion skin modeled after his appearance in the live-action 1995 Mortal Kombat film. 
Khaos Reigns launches digitally on September 24 for all platforms MK1 is available on. It will run for $49.99 on every platform except for Switch, where it costs $39.99. You can read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <updated>2024-07-26T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix’s upcoming film adaptation of Bioshock is still happening, but it won’t be as grand as originally planned. During a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con yesterday, the film’s director and producer revealed the movie now has a reduced scope due to budget cuts.
As reported by Variety, producer Roy Lee (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, The Lego Movie) revealed during Collider’s Producers on Producers panel that since the film’s announcement in February 2022, a regime change at Netflix has affected the project. Netflix’s film chief at that time, Scott Stuber, has since been replaced by Dan Lin. While Stuber emphasized large spending for an expansive film slate, Lin has scaled back to a more modest strategy. This means the Bioshock film’s budget has been reduced, with director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) stating its been reworked as a “more personal film”. 
“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Roy Lee said. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”
A partnership between Netflix, Bioshock publisher Take-Two Interactive, and Vertigo Entertainment is bringing the Bioshock film to life. In addition to Lawrence and Lee serving as director and producer, respectively, Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) was announced as its writer in August 2022.

"If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called Dread Delusion? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles starred in several iconic video games throughout the franchise's 40-year history, but none are more beloved than the beat 'em up entries like the 1989 arcade game and Turtles in Time. However, that genre often lacks the depth modern gamers desire. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate takes various cues from recent popular games – specifically Supergiant's smash hit, Hades – en route to modernizing the action-packed hack-and-slash gameplay the Turtles have been known for since their earliest days in the medium. The result is a fun rogueli…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-07-26T14:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.
The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house. 


Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (Critical Role, Supernatural), Johnny Yong Bosch (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Bleach), and Grey DeLisle (Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines. 
Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Nobody Wants to Die’s world terrifies me. Set only a few hundred years in the future, it paints a dystopian society where humanity has unlocked the secret to immortality, but instead of eternal bliss, it paved the way for the government to have full legal control of our bodies. The world is as fascinating as it is upsetting, and a high-profile murder becomes the catalyst for a gripping (though not always actively engaging) mystery within it.

We're making great progress towards our fall launch date, and can confirm early that #DragonAge: The Veilguard is going all-in on @Steam features!
July 25, 2024
As spotted by Hrungr on X, this means that The Veilguard will be fully functional on Valve’s handheld, which has not been confirmed until now. Consider this a quick PSA for PC players who enjoy playing their role-playing games on the small(ish) screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed once again. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has suffered yet another delay. The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.
Additionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12. 


The delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was formally unveiled in 2020 after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled plans for NFT implementation. The biggest disruption was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and sadly perished in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during Summer Game Fest this year.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the Xbox re-release of the original games that arrived earlier this year.]]></summary>

Not only from larger studios like Arkane, keeping the faith alive with their time loops and space stations, but also from a bunch of smaller developers bravely exploring a typically ambitious genre. RPS has always had an affinity for these systemically luxuriant simulations, historically lauding the likes of the original Deus Ex as the best game ever made. But given everything that has come since, is that still the case? Only one way to find out: make a big list.

But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time strategy then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re not far off from the August 9 premiere of Borderlands, and Lionsgate is giving the final hard sell for the upcoming adaptation in the form of a new trailer.
Like the first game, Borderlands centers on a group of gun-toting Vault hunters searching for treasure on the planet Pandora. They also get roped up to save a mysterious girl who holds the key to a great power. If you’re still not sure what to make of the film after watching its first trailer, hopefully, this last preview will help you decide whether or not you’ll be making the trip to theaters in a couple of weeks to see it. 


Borderlands is directed by Eli Roth and stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Arianna Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Games has acquired Player First Games, the developer of its cross-over platform fighter MultiVersus. The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a press release, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White. 
The announcement comes only a couple of months after MultiVersus' relaunch on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. shuttered the entire mobile division of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios. 
“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”
“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”
MultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version here), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as The Joker, Agent Smith, Jason Voorhees, and the recently announced Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice.]]></summary>

And for some, it'll deliver what's needed: a fairly good time. A time marked by a loop that does hack 'n slash, management, and a dash of base repairs to an average degree. For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.

However, with today's news that such an art book is in the works, we have your first look at it, with its cover image below: 
Coming from Dark Horse Comics, a publication company responsible for all kinds of video game related books and comics, including a similar art book for 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, "The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard" will likely feature official game art, concept art, and more. That's just a guess for now, though – we'll have to wait to learn more. 
In the meantime, Dragon Age: The Veilguard graced the cover of our last Game Informer issue. You can check that out here, and in case you missed it, Game Informer has an entire hub full of exclusive details about the game from our visit to BioWare earlier this year.

Yes, I’d like to combine a sick manual with an action game killstreak for a very large combo, Motördoom. Is this what overly concerned parents thought PS1 games were actually like? If I got a disc with this demo on as a kid, I’d be significantly radder than I am today. Gnarly, even. Made of gnarls.

The Casting of Frank Stone is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and we learned some exclusive details about the upcoming horror game during our trip to Behaviour Interactive’s studio in Montreal. Speaking to Supermassive creative director Steve Goss, he clued us in on the game’s most central and unique mechanic: the Super 8mm camera. 
Set within the Dead by Daylight universe, the game story unfolds in the summer of 1980 in the unassuming small town of Cedar Hills. It follows a group of teenagers who set out to film a horror movie at an abandoned …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.
Arriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come. 


Escalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the PlayStation Blog, the game is getting "a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will be available on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, July 24. This marks the next big Activision Blizzard title to join the service. 
The move comes less than a year after Modern Warfare III launched last November and represents the fruit of Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. It’s also the biggest AB title to appear on Game Pass since Diablo IV was added to the library in March.


This gives subscribers a chance to check out last year’s entry before 2024’s installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, launches on Game Pass on October 25. It also comes ahead of the new Game Pass price increases and subscription tier arriving in September, a move the FTC has taken issue with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the heyday of Sierra's adventure game years, there was a series called Space Quest that featured an intergalactic janitor named Roger Wilco. The series was more satirical than King's Quest, less preachy than Police Quest, and not quite as adult as Leisure Suit Larry. Spearheaded by Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe - a pair of devs who called themselves "Two Guys from Andromeda" - Space Quest was renowned for its humour, and there was a nice sense of progression throughout most of the series, with Roger Wilco leveling up from working class spaceman to the head of his own Star Trek ship.

Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank Stone, and it terrorizes Game Informer’s cover this month.


We traveled to Behaviour’s studio in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to play an early slice of the game and speak to lead developers from both studios to learn how the collaboration came to be. The story also reveals some of the DBD-style mechanics remixing Supermassive’s traditional…]]></summary>

Even if the fallen culture you’ll defend against waves of gribblies offers fascinatingly few concrete details on its origins, there’s a lithe and impressionistic otherworldliness and use of colour in Cataclismo’s art that evokes unearthed layers of history. Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.
Still, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.

You have to ferry a sick man over the hilly countryside, past muddy lake banks and over snowy mountains, all without dropping him on the ground. I can only imagine it controls a bit like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases on Steam.

I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.
I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3’s latest patch was due to launch in closed beta yesterday, but Larian have decided to give it a bit more time in the oven due to bugs. Namely, a bug that caused passive rolls - like those that detect traps - to stop working.
Happily, if you hadn’t already registered to take part in the beta, you now have more time to sign up. Scroll down a bit on the RPG’s Steam page and click the ‘Request Access’ button.

But I still have this one last feature to publish, and it's about Bellara Lutare, the Dalish elf and member of the new Veil Jumpers faction in the game. During my visit to BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year, I checked out the game's expansive character creator, its in medias res prologue, and the first mission after said prologue.
Though BioWare released a big look at Veilguard's prologue via a 20-minute gameplay trailer last month, they haven't released much about that subsequent mission, where you meet and recruit your first companion, Bellara. I learned a lot about this character, and knowing I was one of the first outside of the stud…]]></summary>

Kunitsu-Gami is the kind of wonderful, left-field Capcom release we don’t see often these days. Bound to be a cult classic in the future, Path of the Goddess is original and does not lean on any of Capcom’s established properties. Instead, it relies on an admittedly difficult-to-explain but well-executed gameplay loop that I found hard to put down with an art style that is equally challenging to look away from.
Players take on the role of Soh, a masked swordsperson bound to protect the divine maiden Yoshiro as she slowly dances along the path …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus has two new fighters on the way in the form of Jack from Cartoon Network/Adult Swim's beloved animated series Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice of, well, Beetlejuice and its upcoming sequel (don’t make me write it a third time). The game is also getting a ranked mode.
Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don't get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. 


Season 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.
MultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC. Since its return, the game has been bolstered by new fighters such as The Joker, The Matrix's Agent Smith, and Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps the most unexpected announcement at EVO 2024 was the reveal that 2003’s SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos is being re-released. Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now. 
The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.


SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.

@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS
July 22, 2024
For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word "cyber" in its name.
It's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.
The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.
how do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8’s next Season 1 fighter was revealed during Evo this weekend, and it’s none other than Heihachi Mishima. The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. 
A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. 


Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.

Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.

He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who threw him into a volcano. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D fighting game, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

Now FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage have all received an update on Steam to add Workshop support, Steam Deck verified status, improved performance, and in the case of FlatOut 2, re-enabled online multiplayer.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called Xbox Game Pass Standard, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. Xbox Game Pass Core, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged).

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am burning the Bishop while he sleeps. I'd say it's nothing personal, but quite a lot in medieval management sim Norland is personal. He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. 
“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”
After years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic. 
For our thoughts on Halo Season 1, check out our video reviews of each episode. You can also read our February interview with the showrunners about how they planned to make Season 2 feel more faithful to the games.]]></summary>

Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn does its best to provide an epic adventure despite clear limitations. This semi-open world action game’s bright spots include an exciting premise, a unique tag-team spin on Souls-inspired combat, and an entertaining exploration mechanic. Unfortunately, it falls short of providing a wholly satisfying or polished adventure, resulting in a respectable but flawed revenge quest.

It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. 
The fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.
For example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. 


Using the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. 
Forestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Vessel of Hatred ushers in a wave of change for Diablo IV. The game's first expansion takes players to the new jungle region of Nahantu and, most importantly, introduces the new Spiritborn class. I visited the Blizzard campus to go hands-on with the Spiritborn and speak to some of the designers about how it created a class unlike any other in the Diablo series. After spending a couple of hours playing, the Spiritborn may already be my new favorite class in the game.

With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. 


Like the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. 
Additionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. 
Splitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been fumbling for a grasp on Bokeh's skull-splitting horror game Slitterhead since I first heard the words "brought to you by Keiichiro Toyama, former designer of Silent Hill, Siren and Gravity Rush". Thanks to a new interview, I now have a proper description of the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried visual novel games in the past, like A Space For The Unbound and Hatoful Boyfriend. And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.
Until Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.

It’s an action RPG that made me pine for the outdoors and want to be whisked away from all my responsibilities and just exist for a bit. Each time I would finish playing I’d be thinking about my next getaway, and although dungeon delving wouldn’t be on my holiday itinerary Dungeons of Hinterberg is making me think twice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout, a TV adaptation of the popular post-apocalyptic video game series, was released on Amazon Prime this past April. Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.
Fallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations. Secondly, Walton Goggins was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for his portra…]]></summary>

Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la Battlefield V. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.
Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS Over The Top WW1 instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.
Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.
"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.
Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.
Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I increasingly judge Souls-adjacent games not by the height of their bosses or the depth of their dungeons, but the cleverness of their shortcuts, and Flintlock: Siege Of Dawn has my favourite shortcuts in an age. Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound.
