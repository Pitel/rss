The latest Sonic platformer Sonic Superstars made its debut on the Switch and multiple other platforms last month. Digital Foundry has now uploaded a tech review, seeing how the Nintendo version of the game compares to the rest.
All versions except the Nintendo Switch "largely share the same visual qualities". In handheld mode, the Switch delivers a full 720p native output but some stages run at a 720p resolution. In docked, the resolution hits 720p, with reduced texture resolution and lower texture filtering.

More specifically, Gearbox's first official Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm developer diary is about the DLC's all-new final boss and the lore behind its existence. Though lore hasn't historically been a huge draw in Risk of Rain or its highly acclaimed sequel, Risk of Rain 2, it's worth highlighting that the franchise has a significant narrative backlog going in the background of all the killing. And now, the False Son represents the consequences of what the Survivors have been doing on the planet …]]></summary>

Or maybe you hate killing things in Genshin and want minions to do your dirty work instead? Well, now that Furina is here, I’ve been able to live my dreams of becoming a Pokémon trainer in Genshin Impact.


So, how do you play Pokémon in Genshin? Certain characters, like Fischl, can summon creatures to fight for them. Fischl can summon a crow familiar named Oz, who stays on-field and deals damage. There are others, too, like Kokomi, who summons a jellyfish, and Xiangling, who summons a small bear named Guoba. Combine multiple summons like this, and you end up with a field full of Pokémon ready to do your bidding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zagreus has found his new home: Netflix. Revealed during Netflix Geeked Week, Supergiant Games' Hades is coming to Netflix's gaming service in 2024.




The 2020 roguelike is joining the ranks of Immortality, Spiritfarer, and Oxenfree as one of the available games in the service. Netflix Gaming is free for all Netflix subscribers, so owners of the streaming giant can play at no extra cost. The announcement also came with the news that Braid, Death's Door, and Katana Zero would be added in 2024.


It's in the Blood


Hades follows the son of the titular ruler of the underworld, Zagreus, as he tries to escape the Underworld. With the help of the gods of Olympus, you die, die, and die again as you battle through ever-changing maps. Upon its release on Switch and PC, the game was lauded for its character design and addicting roguelike gameplay.


Our own Jordan Devore rated the game a 9/10, citing Supergiant Games' strong storytelling and stellar RPG combat. Hades was nominated for multiple Game of the Year awards and even won Destructoid's own Overall Best Game of 2020. 


I played the heck out of Hades when it was on Game Pass. Seeing it made available for all Netflix subscribers is a joy. Now, more people can play this stellar game whenever and wherever they want. It's a trip to Hell I am down to go to.


The timing for Hades to come to Netflix is pretty coincidental, as Supergiant Games is expanding the universe next year with Hades II. The game, which made its way onto my RPGs to look out for, follows Zagreus' sister, Melinoë. Instead of her father, she'll face the Titan of Time alongside new faces. The game is set to go Early Access in Q2 of 2024 for PC. While it's set to release on consoles, no specifics were given.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The adventures of Lara Croft are looking quite promising. As part of Netflix Geeked Week, Legendary Entertainment released a behind-the-scenes look at the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft series.


Powerhouse Animation Studios, known for its Castlevania series, is taking on the daring archaeologist with the help of Legendary Entertainment. Based on Crystal Dynamics' reboots/prequels, Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft sets up the Lara seen in the 1996 original. The video, narrated by Character Design Supervisor Joy Lua, showcases the globe-trotting journeys we'll see her take, as well as some callbacks to different games.




Tomb Raider steps out of the shadows for Netflix


The video starts with some drawings and rough storyboard scenes, previewing some of the show's worldwide action. We see Lara snowboarding off a parachute and traversing buildings in Paris like an action hero. As Lara in the reboot trilogy usually stayed in one country, it's cool to see her out and about. 


Concepts for the places she'll go (yes, including tombs) are shown toward the end. She'll also sport some new gear, donning a dress in one shot and snow gear in another. Of course, she'll have her bow, pickaxe, and pistols alongside her. The team aims to provide many Easter eggs for longtime fans and bridge the gap between old and new. 


While the animated Netflix series picks up after Shadow of the Tomb Raider, reboot era Lara voice actress Camilla Luddington of Grey's Anatomy is not reprising her role, with Marvel the MCU's Agent Carter, Haley Atwell, picking up the dual pistols. Jonah, played by Earl Baylon, is back and given a small look via concept art. As a fan of Castlevania and Powerhouse, as well as the reboots, it seems like Lara is in good hands.


Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is slated to release sometime in 2024.

The Coffin of Andy and Leyley is probably the first title to take me back to this oddly specific point in my life. Since playing the first two episodes, I can't get it out of my head. 


The game follows siblings Andrew and Ashley Graves as they hatch a plan to escape the apartment they're trapped in. Along the way, they develop a taste for human flesh, and it's quickly clear that both are monsters.


It's a well-written exploration of a toxic sibling dynamic and a revolting experience. I hesitate to call it trashy because it almost always balan…]]></summary>

It's also been confirmed via social media a "Mac and Linux" release will arrive later next year after the initial launch.

So it is in Mob Factory, a blend of tower defense and factory management in which you quickly set up defenses against waves of worms, spiders, skeletons and so forth - and then set up spawners to create more waves, so you can turn their fallen remains into conveyor belts, walls, and eventually new islands to expand your monster-chewing factories upon. It just came out on Steam.

Enter KeeperFx, a long-running open source project to make the original Dungeon Keeper run at higher resolutions, with widescreen support, improved AI, online multiplayer, modern controls and user-made levels. After fifteen years of on-off development, it just hit 1.0.

Now Reddit user m0lmy has posted their experience with unlocking the strange Robomando, a secret 16th playable character. 


"To my knowledge," says m0lmy in their Reddit comment, "I am the first person to unlock this character intentionally." They, of course, posted a whole set of impressively complicated instructions for others to follow in their footsteps. Now that they are known and readily available, it shouldn't be too hard for players to follow m0lmy's guide to unlocking the Robomando for themselves, but be warned: they're about as random as random gets.

Though Valve's effectively refreshing its entire lineup of Steam Deck handhelds on November 16, some features of the original lineup are being carried over to newer models. One of them, specifically, is the anti-glare screen coating that's present on the 1TB Steam Deck model. In most respects, the Steam Deck OLED is a substantial upgrade to the original, but tech reviewer Dave2D has raised concerns that the etched glass isn't doing any favors to the new OLED display.

Just days ago, Nintendo launched the sixth and final DLC wave for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch. The patch notes detailed all sorts of general updates and fixes.
This included a lot of fine adjustments, and we've got some extra insight, courtesy of the Japanese website Mario Kart Blog (via Meester_Tweester on the Mario Kart subreddit). As you can see, there are some balance changes to a number of the vehicles, and also some extra details about the new racers:

Smash T.V. was originally released in arcades in 1990. It was designed by the legendary Eugene Jarvis, the guy behind 1981’s Defender. More importantly, he created 1982’s Robotron: 2084, which is the godfather of twin-stick shooters. Smash T.V. was built as a spiritual successor to that game, so it has all the features you’d expect, which is to say, it is also a twin-stick shooter.


Super Smash T.V. is the title used by the SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive, Master System, and Game Gear versions. What makes it “Super?” Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s just a straight port of the arcade title.

It has been almost a year since the release of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, meaning it's been now a full year of apologies, paused expansions, and transformative patches. And yet it lives.

The co-op shooter now seems on firmer ground, and to celebrate it's getting a two-part update called The Traitor Curse. Part one will add a new zone and mission, among other updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great Pretender, the exciting heist anime that was made available via Netflix in the Summer of 2020, could be teasing another season to be announced very soon. In a post made via Twitter, the official Great Pretender account reveals a “new release” will be announced on November 18 at Anime NYC.


In the post, an 18-second video serves as a highlight reel of the first season’s exploits, with the tagline “the greatest con artists return to the party,” which seems like a strong gesture towards another season.




In any case, the announcement will take place at a special panel held from 12:45 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. ET in Panel Room 1. The panel is set to feature George Wada, the president of Production I.G. and Wit Studio; Hiro Kaburagi, the director of Great Pretender; and Hitoshi Ito, the anime’s producer. According to Anime NYC’s website, those in attendance will be “invited to be the first to watch the world premiere and win some specially prepared presents from the guests.”


As stated, Great Pretender was released globally via Netflix on August 20, 2020. It ran for 23 episodes across four story arcs, with each arc covering a unique heist for the primary characters to pull off. I don’t wanna spoil it for anyone reading, but if this announcement is indeed a second season, let’s just say it’ll be more than welcomed with the ending of the season finale taken into account.

Now there's an easier way to make those fangames. I Wanna Maker is a freeware precision platformer with level editor and easy level sharing, and it just hit version 1.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roadwarden's creator, the Polish writer and designer Aureus of Moral Anxiety Studio, is an enthusiastic and inventive player of table-top games. Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. "They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. 


"They had no shame!" Aureus goes on. "Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all."  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. "So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths."

That's exciting enough to me in concept, but there's a trailer below that finally shows what each of those halves look like. It includes: finely animated dialogue options, and frenetic races in which you can swing the back-end of your car to smash rival racers off the road.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's gaming push is looping in one of its larger animated properties. The Dragon Prince: Xadia is a new action-RPG in development, arriving next year on mobile through Netflix.


The project looks to be handled by Wonderstorm, per the official site, and definitely takes after the action-RPG genre. In the reveal trailer, we can see quite a few gameplay moments that feel reminiscent of Diablo, Hades, and the like.




Characters look to run around, bash enemies' heads in, and unleash magic upon the battlefield. Netflix's teaser describes the game as a "hack & slash looter ARPG," and also notes you can team up with friends. Feels very Diablo-y to me.


For the roster, I see a few expected faces, including leads like Callum and Rayla. I'm admittedly a bit behind on the show, but it's nice to see the breadth of choices here. The shield-toting Amaya is a very welcome inclusion, too.


Netflix and games


The online streaming giant Netflix has been steadily making headway in the realm of games. It has a mobile service which has featured access to some notable titles, like 2018 gem Spiritfarer.


The company's also making its own big push into games, through internal measures and external acquisitions of studios like Spry Fox and Oxenfree maker Night School Studio. Joseph Staten, of Halo/343 fame, was even brought on as Netflix Games' creative director.


It does seem like Netflix continues to be interested in games, both on their own and as properties for streaming shows. Whether these efforts pan out will be interesting to see, but it's at least a good sign that Netflix's game service has eschewed the microtransactions that typically plague mobile offerings. Because of that, this Dragon Prince ARPG on-the-go could be one to watch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox console versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are on their way. And it looks like the optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version of BG3 may have some benefits for other platforms, too.


Larian Studios head Swen Vincke shared a look at some graphs for the upcoming port of Baldur's Gate 3. Notably, the graphs highlight how the optimizations being made are addressing an overall Baldur's Gate 3 speedbump: memory.


"Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back I think this will benefit all platforms too," Vincke writes. "Still some work left but very close now."




A new horizon for Baldur's Gate 3


The Xbox Series versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are still coming along but planned for this year. While the massive RPG hit PC and PS5 earlier this year, the Xbox version was held off for some time, citing concerns about the Series S, a compromise was finally reached: allowing the Series S version to launch without split-screen co-op.


While the issues initially surrounded parity, seeing as the Series S is a step behind both the Series X and PlayStation 5, it looks like optimizing that port might be beneficial for all. The improvements in VRAM and RAM shown above definitely seem enticing, and if this makes my PC run BG3 better, then I'm all for it.


Plus, it means many more people will be able to play Baldur's Gate 3. Despite a frankly crowded year for big releases, Larian's RPG has been a huge hit for players, including myself. Getting Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series S consoles, and optimizing it more in the process, seems like a real win-win.

While we all have our personal lists, The Game Awards (TGA) packages that into something a little more formal.


We've crafted our way through Hyrule, rolled in the Forgotten Realms, explored the Settled Systems, and swung through New York. As a massive celebration of video games, TGA acts as a sign-off and spotlight for things to come. With its formal list of nominees planned for a November 13 reveal, I figured I'd highlight a few of 2023's dark horse candidates. Commit the box art to memory 'cause I'm hoping for some snubs, surprises, and success stories out of these.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Level-5 has quite the lineup of games in store, but it's taking some extra time for at least one of them. The studio has confirmed that Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is being pushed into 2024.


The team says it's pushing the Switch game back to ensure Fantasy Life i is released "in better quality to everyone." No firm release date for next year's been set, but we'll be hearing about it soon. Level-5 is holding another Vision 2023 event later this month on November 29, where it plans to announce the new release date for Fantasy Life i.




What's ahead for Level-5


Considering a number of Level-5's other projects are all still labeled 2023—and we're running out of 2023 with each day that passes—I wouldn't be surprised to see some other windows shift. If anything's left to launch this year, there's not a lot of time left.


That said, this reinvigorated Level-5 is exciting to see come together. While the studio's been largely working on properties like Ni no Kuni and Yo-Kai Watch for the last few years, they've now got a hefty lineup of both familiar and fresh games. One in particular, Decapolice, has really caught my eye, and reportedly looked good at Tokyo Game Show 2023.


My hope is that Level-5 gets the time to comfortably make what they want to. This studio produces some wild, wonderful worlds that are a blast to explore, and both Fantasy Life i and its other games look really intriguing. We'll hopefully learn more about Level-5's docket moving forward at the end of the month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve heard it being said many times and many ways, but this year has been an excellent one for games and an abysmal one for the folks who create them. On that note, Samurai Punk—the studio behind several indie games including Killbug and Screencheat—has announced its closure in a post via Twitter.




In the post, the team celebrates an impressive decade-long run as a studio, and notes that “it’s been an amazing run and we’d like to thank our team past and present; the 9 incredible games we’ve made wouldn’t have been possible without them.” 


In speaking of the team, Samurai Punk has created a Google doc with the information for those affected by this closure. “These incredible folks will now be looking for new roles, so if you have roles available or know of any openings, please contact us or the individuals directly.”


Samurai Punk was established in 2014, and is responsible for Screencheat, as well as The American Dream, Feather, Roombo: First Blood, and Killbug, among others. It is by no means the only studio that has suffered a closure in 2023 — some examples include Dillon’s Rolling Western developer Vanpool, Boomerang X developer Dang!, and the Embracer Group-owned Volition Games, who made Saints Row.


It genuinely hurts me to hear news like this, especially when games like Screencheat somehow manage to fly under my radar all this time. I am hoping with all my heart that these talented creators are able to land on their feet and continue creating for years to come.

As we approach 2024, we're naturally getting increasingly keen to learn more about Nintendo's next major piece of hardware, affectionately dubbed the 'Switch 2', for now. After all, although the current line-up of upcoming Switch games is certainly nothing to sneer at, there's no denying that Nintendo is leaning heavily on remakes and remasters, presumably while its core teams work on 'next-gen' titles. If that doesn't indicate a new console is on the horizon, we're not sure what does.
At the moment, the majority of us are under the assumption that the 'Switch 2' will be a reasonably 'safe' upgrade to the current console in general form and function; a hybrid device that retains the core concept of the Switch but beefs up the performance considerably while possibly adding a few new innovations here and there. It makes sense, right? Although many of us are eager to move on to the next big thing, Nintendo isn't ready to ditch the Switch brand, and none of us want it to. It still works wonderfully after all these years, so why do anything drastically different?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, a group of modders released their own Community Patch for Starfield, representing a collaboration working to improve the studio's new IP. Creative fans have crafted mods left, right, and center since the game's release, and that's without official modding support from Bethesda. 


In a recent interview with Eurogamer, Timothy "Halgari" Baldridge, one of the founders of the Starfield Community Patch, spoke about the efforts being put in to fix issues with the space-faring RPG. Halgari broke down how Starfield's hindered modding potential is a bit of a sore spot and how digging around reveals game code that prepared for those features, but they aren't there yet. 


It looks like a plan, according to Halgari, that Bethesda "would add modding some day" to its new IP but hasn't yet. H…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get your bribe money ready. Weappy Studios, the developer behind This is the Police, has unveiled their latest game, Hollywood Animal. It’s set to release on PC sometime in 2024.


Hollywood Animal is a narrative management sim where you try to run a movie studio with as few scruples as possible. Manage staff through gifts or blackmail, create movies to gain favors, but just keep things as profitable as possible. Craft art, build stars, or simply find their dark spots so you can stick a hook in and make them dance. All this is covered in the absolutely fantastic announcement trailer.




I don’t remember the last time I saw a game trailer that superb.


Hollywood Animal is being billed as a narrative-first game, but includes all the standard management hooks. By the looks of all the systems show off, it’s really quite complex. It takes you through the ages as you try to keep your studio afloat while not bringing too much attention to your shady dealings. Select the director, the writers, and the actors, and then try to keep them all happy (or at least complacent). Navigate the changing political landscape of the ages.


I am so on board with this. I’ve wanted a good movie studio simulator for a while, or at least a re-release of 2005’s The Movies. Crime is also a passion of mine, so it's a really good mix.


Hollywood Animals is currently announced for PC and is expected to land sometime in 2024.

It comes courtesy of Aerothorn, who asks: What is your favorite co-op gaming memory? (along with the additional clarification that these memories don't need to be confined to designed-for-co-op games, but could also stem from playing a single-player game with a friend. "I used to play Descent with me piloting and my friend gunning!" they said).
So which games make us think of happy times with pals and good company? Come and find out below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.
Zelnick cautioned one investor against "generalising" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.
Here's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been "demade" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. 
Crow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year has seen a slew of studios and gaming companies face significant layoffs, and it doesn't seem like things are set to slow down soon. It appears Unity may be the next to suffer layoffs as it attempts to become a "leaner, more agile, and faster growing company."


In a shareholder letter, Unity CEO James Whitehurst claims that the company has a big opportunity to grow in the future, though that may be difficult at present because the team is trying to do too much at once. As Whitehurst explains, "we are not achieving the synergies that exist across our portfolio, and we are not executing to our full potential." 


Third-quarter financial results are described as "mixed." The strategy to make the company leaner will include increasing focus on its main projects such as the Unity Editor. Though nothing is set in stone yet, the plan will likely involve discontinuing certain products, reducing the business's office footprint, and reducing the size of the workforce. 


The letter also addressed the controversy surrounding the announcement of runtime fees. Whitehurst acknowledges that "the execution created friction with our customers and near-term headwinds." Despite this, there's no indication of any intentions to back down. The event is described as "now mostly behind us," though it is expected that because of the controversy, the new business model will be minimally beneficial in 2024 until customers adopt Unity's new releases.


No date is given regarding when these interventions will be implemented but further guidance will come with the fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.

        <updated>2023-11-10T15:44:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite its legacy, Xbox 360 puzzle-platformer Braid hasn't been around much. However, that's all about to change as the game's creator Jonathan Blow has recently announced an Anniversary Edition coming in 2024.


Releasing April 30, this new version of Braid comes with improved visuals and animations, areas that have been "re-envisioned to make them more unique," and more than 15 hours of commentary. If you're interested in the world game development, that last one may be of interest to you.




This special Anniversary Edition – which is launching to celebrate 15 years of Braid – is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, and even Netflix. It'll also be available on PS4 and Xbox One, with Linux and Mac ports coming later on.


Considered a "masterpiece"


Originally released on Xbox 360 in 2008, Braid has been described as one of the greatest independent games of its generation. It won several awards and was the second-largest-selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. It has a Metacritic score of 93.


Its developer Blow is no stranger to the video game world. Some of his earlier work includes being a programmer on Oddworld: Munchy's Oddysee and Deus Ex: Invisible War. He released the puzzle title The Witness in 2016.


He's also gained something of a reputation over the years, often being held aloft as an outspoken critic of the gaming industry. He was described in a 2016 New Yorker article as a "prickly genius," while an interview with Kotaku in 2011 said Blow's opinions are not aimed at individuals, but at "trends." He's also no stranger to making public controversial statements over the years, further complicating his legacy.


In any case, Braid is often signposted as an indie release that helped shape an industry of indie releases. This was before Minecraft did it. If you still haven't played the game (guilty), April's Anniversary Edition is definitely one to look out for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Update: The full song has been released! You can find it on YouTube as part of this Game Changer album playlist, as well as via the embedded video below. The album can be found on iTunes and BandCamp.]




The Grammy award-winning The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence are releasing a new cover of the Marvel vs Capcom 2 song "I Wanna Take You for a Ride." It's been covered many times by the VGM community, but in this instance, new verses and a bridge accompany the admittedly repetitive tune. 




Marvel vs Capcom 2 jam gets taken for a ride


Despite the original release from Marvel vs Capcom 2 repeating the same line over and over again, it's one with a special place in fan memories with a funky beat too delicious to ignore. Thankfully, The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence bring their own vision to the bop with a full song based on the loop. This version adds new lyrics, verses, and a bridge next month on November 10.


The 45 seconds released on social media from The 8-Bit Big Band has an outstanding suite of brass instruments and thrilling vocals. Almost time for MAHVEL, baby. 


Last year, the 8-Bit Big Band (and Button Basher) won a "Best Arrangement - Instrumental or A Capella" Grammy for its cover of "Meta Knight's Revenge" from Kirby Super Star. Since its release in 2021, the theme received over 1 million views on YouTube.


Perhaps with this upcoming Marvel vs Capcom 2 cover, they'll get another Grammy. Nevertheless, The 8-Bit Big Band has an upcoming show in New York on December 15. Its fourth album, "Game Changer," accompanies the Marvel jam on November 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout 76 was released on November 14, 2018 in a wretched state, and I absolutely cannot believe it's been five years since then. While most publishers would have buried it and moved on, the creative team got to work and the funding arrived to salvage the game. To celebrate, in-game events are on the way.


Fallout 76 5-year anniversary event details


We're not getting a massive quality of life overhaul or DLC per se, but there will be a streaming event on Twitch on Tuesday November 14 at 3PM ET, as well as a birthday event from now through November 21 at 12PM ET.


Here is the full rundown of the stream from Bethesda:



"Organized by our friends at Fallout for Hope, we have over 40 floats, live music, Atom giveaways and more! Did we also mention that Adrienne Barbeau, who you know as the voice of the Overseer, will be doing a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. introduction speech? And who better to narrate the parade than Wes Johnson himself? Wes Johnson who you know as the voice of… well… all our favorite robots! Protectrons, Fasnacht Paraders, Nuka-World's Dr. Del Walsh, and many more! (No, seriously, look him up we love his voice!)"




Fallout 76 is in good company, alongside No Man's Sky and Final Fantasy XIV (1.0)


While there was no excuse for the state it was launched in, Fallout 76 gets high marks on its report card in the BUG (bring-up-grades) section. The team actually committed to making the game better, and while it took nearly two years to add NPCs (the turning point for 76), they came all the same. It sounds rediculous, adding in content that seems standard for open world games, but such was the early state of Fallout 76.

I think I know why. Let me find the tweet. Here it is. Lead engine designer at Nightdive, Samuel Villarreal tweeted, “Nothing's better than failing PS4 certification one week before a game is shipped because it crashes when loading a specific level, only on a PS4 Pro, only on 4k resolution, and only when a debugger is not attached.” He then sarcastically added, “Yup, I sure do enjoy that.”




He later added that the issue has now been fixed, but the turnaround time on certification is slow.


There's no official confirmation that certification problems were the cause of the delay i…]]></summary>

Player morale is at an all-time low, tanking after a round of Bungie layoffs and news of a reported delay for the upcoming The Final Shape expansion. And while Bungie is using the delay to double down on ensuring the new expansion is a smash hit, serious concerns about Destiny's longevity are cropping up. Even if The Final Shape proves to be everything Bungie promises, inescapable factors persist against the game.


But the situation didn't get like this overnight. Bungie's decisions reportedly came after noting the title's yearly revenue would fall 45% below expectations. That sharp decline is symptomatic of issues that have been building for years. And with player sentiment where it is, alongside a projected content drought and a perceived "endpoin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer announcement being made recently, all eyes are once again on Rockstar's behemoth franchise. Not that eyes were ever truly off it. GTA 5 is still doing phenomenally well, as outlined in Take-Two Interactive's recent figures.


According to conference call notes uploaded a couple of days ago, Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold approximately 190 million units since it launched in 2013. Compare this to November 2022's prepared remarks – when it had sold 170 million – and it's obvious the game is still selling in droves.


At this rate, it could well fly past the 200 million mark, maintaining its stance as the second highest-selling game after Minecraft (which recently hit 300 million).


Better be worth the wait


GTA 6 is still pretty elusive. Aside from the leak in 2022, we really don't know much about the hugely anticipated follow-up. Rockstar has promised the first official trailer in December, so at least we have that to look forward to.


It's a tall order to be the next big thing after Grand Theft Auto 5, but after years of speculations, leaks, and the collective will of gamers everywhere, the world is finally ready for the next installment.


It's tempting to say that once the sixth game comes out, sales of GTA 5 may slow down significantly. However, Rockstar's not above rehashing some of its older (and more lucrative) titles, so who knows what the studio has planned for the game. There's still some milking to be done for that proverbial cash cow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's pretty well known that Bethesda nearly had a voiced protagonist in Starfield. The developer decided against it in the end. However, did you know that one of those actors could well have been the voice behind Adam Jensen?


In a recent post on Twitter/X, Elias Toufexis, who takes on the role of the main character in the two most recent Deus Ex games, said he was originally going to voice the Starfield hero.




He also said that Cissy Jones – another prolific video game voice artist – was originally planned to play the protagonist, presumably the female version. However, while Bethesda did scrap the idea in the end, we did still get to hear both actors, with Toufexis playing Sam Coe and Jones playing Andreja.


Would it have been better?


With the exception of Fallout 4, Bethesda games typically have a silent main character. Many argue this helps with immersion. It could also be a time, money, and labor-saving decision at the hands of the studio.


In any case, Starfield having a mute protagonist is par for the course for Todd Howard and his team. We could be looking at a different experience if we had Toufexis' gravelly dialogue guiding us through the cosmos.


Despite major hype for the game, Starfield doesn't feel like it has the staying power of something like Skyrim. It's still a good sci-fi game – and the continuous updates will only improve things – but it might be a stretch to think of it as a potential Bethesda classic in years to come.

As Gematsu reports, the event will run for half an hour, and English subtitles will be available. You can expect to receive plenty of information and release dates for upcoming Level-5 games including Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, DECAPOLICE, FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time, Megaton Musashi Wired, and Professor Layton and The New World of Steam. 


The last Vision 2023 event was held in March and it featured trailers for several titles, including Megaton Musashi Wired. During this month's event, I'll be looking out for the latest entry in the Professor Layton series which will hopefully receive a release date. It appeared at the previous event, giving us a look into what we can expect from the story. 




The latest Inazuma Eleven game will also be worth taking a peek at. It was originally slated for a 2018 release, but several delays have pushed it back for years. Hopefully, the long wait is almost over.

More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. 


Naturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.

Given that he’s an internet icon these days and the star of countless memes, it’s a bit of a surprise that it’s taken this long – 12 full years, in fact – to find a way to get Shrek into another video game. The last title to feature the onion-layered ogre was DreamWorks Super Star Kartz, released by Activision in 2011 for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, and 3DS. It’s somewhat fitting, then, that he would return in another DreamWorks karting game, and equally fitting that it too feels two generations old.
DreamWorks All-Star Kart Racing is the latest offering from Bamtang Games, which was previously responsible for the Nickelodeon Kart Racers trilogy (which started weak on Switch, got better with the second game then lost its way again with the final entry). Sadly, while this DreamWorks-themed racer has a number of decent ideas, the execution is as sloppy as a Bergin eating a Troll.

Nintendo has published the official English translation of the financial report Q&A for Q2 FY2024, and it wraps up with a particularly interesting comment on the company's recently-changed approach to hardware and software development.
Asked about whether Nintendo has shifted to using software as a means of bringing about new styles of gameplay (rather than hardware), Director and Senior Managing Executive Officer Shinya Takahashi stated that the company has recently started to see the software and hardware development teams holding conversations as "a single unit" from the "early stages of hardware development".

When Nintendo announced that it was developing a movie based on The Legend of Zelda, Shigeru Miyamoto wrenched control of Nintendo's Twitter account away from the company's social team to give a few short details on the project.
There, he stated that he had been "working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san". We took "many years" to mean three or four, possibly five at a push, but it turns out we were way off. According to the newly translated Q&A session from Nintendo's latest financial release, Miyamoto and Arad have been discussing the movie for ten years. A decade, folks.

As Schreier explains, MW3 was originally pitched as a DLC, but the game was suddenly turned into a standalone title to fill in a gap in the company's release schedule after another 2023 CoD game planned for this year was delayed. This has been denied by an Activision spokesperson, but Schreier insists that "more than a dozen current and former Call of Duty developers said that conflicts with what they were told at the time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Risk Of Rain was a chaotic, 2D sidescroller about turning a tiny character into a wandering projectile swarm. It's sequel mimicked the systems but switched from pixel art to 3D - and in my eyes lost a little of its readability in the process.

Enter Risk Of Rain Returns, a full remaster of the 2D original with higher resolution artwork, new survivors, and slicker multiplayer. It's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 is already a scary game. Having a guy who looks and sounds like Max Payne coming at you like an aggressive red panda probably isn't necessary. Luckily, a new update for Alan Wake 2 fixes a T-posing Alex Casey while addressing progression-halting bugs.


To be fair, the latter is arguably far more terrifying. Most should agree that a bug stopping your story progress in a game is both scary and frustrating. In fact, it actually happened to me yesterday in Alan Wake 2. The rides at the Espresso Express were clipped into the wooden platform, and the capsule that was supposed to move out of the way wasn't. And I didn't feel like pushing a wheelbarrow around. Luckily, things should be sorted out after today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has unveiled its first upgraded iteration of the Steam Deck. Dubbed simply the Steam Deck OLED, the new handheld features several technical and form factor improvements, and it goes on sale next week.
As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?


Not quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want "more, more, more" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the Steam Deck OLED is awash with upgrades over the original handheld PC, it’s not a full replacement, and Valve still reckon that anyone wanting a proper Steam Deck 2 will be waiting a while. 
I was told as much on the Steam Deck’s first anniversary earlier this year, and according to Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, that stance won't change once the Steam Deck OLED releases on November 16th. In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.
Valve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve love their surprise hardware announcements, and there’s just been a doozy in the Steam Deck OLED. It’s a "definitive" refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Vladimir Makarov, the babyfaced villain of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, trust and morale are irrelevant concepts. As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.


Instead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.

Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces.

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.
But aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“To be a good designer, you have to have very, very strong opinions,” says Slay The Spire design lead Anthony Giovannetti. “Show me a game designer who gives a thumbs-up to most things, and I suspect that’s probably someone who doesn’t have a very good game design sense. I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”
It’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony announced it was acquiring Destiny 2 maker Bungie for $3.6 billion in January of 2022. A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation's in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog's Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice. It seems that evaluation has led to Sony retooling its approach as the company has delayed at least six liv…]]></summary>

It turns out plenty of others enjoyed developer Insomniac Games' latest superhero effort, too, because Sony has revealed that in just 11 days, it sold through more than 5 million copies, making it one of the year's best-selling games.
For context, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too. 
Woo! We're incredibly honored to announce Marvel's #SpiderMan2PS5 has sold over 5 MILLION COPIES!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.
Zelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff.

If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel's Core i5 12600KF is one of the company's best value gaming CPUs, and today it's down to $155 at Walmart (fulfilled via Newegg) versus its standard price of $220. 
This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD's Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As regular readers of this column will know, I'm a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar's GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt. The no-name crim has become the star attraction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora introduces three brand-new clans to the Avatar universe: the Aranahe, Zeswa, and Kame’tire. Each tribe calls one of the Western Frontier’s three biomes – Kinglor Forest, Upper Plains, and Clouded Forest, respectively – home. Ingratiating yourself with each one by learning their ways is an important step in your journey to reclaim your Na’vi culture, as well as garnering enough support to push back against the exploitative mining of the villainous RDA.
For a heads-up on what to expect as you try to warm up to each clan, here’s a breakdown of the culture and personality.

The first clan you encounter resides in the Kinglor Forest. Like the Omatikaya clan from the first film, the Aranahe live in a Hometree and have a symbiotic relationship with Kinglor, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one genre I've never quite had the reflexes or spatial awareness for, it's the bullet hell shooter. I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It's been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward.

The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you're a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you're doing here, and why everybody's so terrified of the sun. I haven't deciphered the mystery yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

This is Mass Effect 5, actual title possibly Mass Effect: Epsilon - "epsilon" being the Top Secret Codename of this hidden page on the Mass Effect website. What does it all mean? I don't know.

So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn't go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I've had to stop working in the manner I once did.

        <updated>2023-11-07T18:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023's wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company's Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition," the company told both IGN and Kotaku. "We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams." Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to "to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term."
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

To kick off the month of exclusive coverage, we sat down with game director Ditte Deenfeldt and associate game director Drew Rechner and flooded them with questions: How does co-op work? Can your ikran be killed? What's the difference between an Avatar and a fursona? Get the answers to all that and more in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After almost two years in early access spanning 53 updates, sociable retro sci-fi FPS The Anacrusis has a 1.0 release date - 5th December 2023. The word "anacrusis" refers to a set of syllables that precede the first metrical foot in a line of poetry - an intriguing moniker for a game that is essentially Valve's Left 4 Dead, but set in a 1970s-styled high tech facility reminiscent of No One Lives Forever. I'll be honest, I haven't been keeping up with The Anacrusis, and assumed that it was one of those top-drawer philosophical puzzlers. Come on, there isn't even a pun in the title!

We visited Massive’s studio in Malmö, Sweden, to play a couple of hours of the game set in the Kinglor Forest, one of Frontier’s three regions.

He's now founded a new studio called Inevitable Studios and the team's first game is a narrative-based action platformer called Always in Mind.

It's currently available to wishlist on Steam, indicating a PC release, but there's no word about consoles. However, the announcement comes with news that a Kickstarter for Always in Mind is coming soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Apple's keynote event last September, everyone expected them to announce the new iPhone, but nobody expected them to announce that multiple Resident Evil games would be headed to the device. Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early on in The Talos Principle 2, one of your soon-to-be robot pals says to you with a completely straight face, "We're here to solve this puzzle, not to discuss philosophy." I can almost see Croteam's writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot's eyes. You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. 
Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn't without its faults, it's a more-than-worthy follow-up.

After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a "regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience." 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says "players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community." 
"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community," studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. "We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries."
For more, read Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review and then listen to us talk about it on The Game Informer Show.

Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it's one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.


Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that's everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here. 
For more, read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review and then check out this update where Remedy discusses its development progress on Control 2 and its Max Payne remakes.

This news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 


It's possible the Switch reaches the DS' numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn't end sales of the hardware. And consider…]]></summary>

The developers in question are a mixture of former full-time staff and former Keywords Studios QA testers who have worked on Dreadwolf under contract. They've organised pickets outside BioWare Edmonton's offices in Canada, and are calling on BioWare fans to get involved on social media, while trying to engage current BioWare staff in conversation about unionisation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. "Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary," a press release reads. "Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu." 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class "never seen before in the Diablo universe." 
And that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. "Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power," Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here's a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review.

You might recognise Inworld as the tech used by that GTA 5 mod about AI cultists in which characters speak AI-generated dialogue, which Rockstar blocked from distribution over the summer. Suffice to say that Microsoft have grander plans for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

Naturally, those experiments devolved from a noble effort to remove the stain of cars into a sadistic urge to drive thousands of my own people on a never-ending hell march.

We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.
In the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year.

One of the early replies was an "ummm actually," pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded "I'm one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that's not America". I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach "Zach Gage" Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment revealed three new World of Warcraft expansions this weekend during BlizzCon 2023, starting with The War Within, which launches next year. Midnight will follow it in the new Worldsoul Saga, which the studio is calling an "ambitious creative endeavor for the Warcraft universe," and The Last Titan will release after that. Together, The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan make up the Worldsoul Saga. 

"Deep beneath the surface, an ancient Nerubian civilization is rising to power, aided by Xal'atath, the harbinger of the Void first introduced in the Legion expansion," a press release reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mad dashes, daring escapes, last minute reversals: these are some of my favourite moments in multiplayer shooters. It’s exhilarating to scream towards the chopper in Left 4 Dead or a dropship in Titanfall. 

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I've played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/documentary/2023/11/06/the-making-of-humanity-2023s-best-puzzle-game"/>
        <updated>2023-11-06T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game's development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world," Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. "There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity."
Watch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. "Violence Is Inevitable" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games launched Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017 and if you followed the game back then, you likely know that every other week, there was news that Fortnite had its biggest day ever in terms of player count and other impressive metrics. Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite's history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn't list a specific reason but it's pretty clear it's because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer's breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite's Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

They've brought on original Portal voice actress Ellen McClain to narrate the footage, and the result is genuinely quite funny. As you'd expect, GlaDOS isn't that impressed by Croteam's work. I score this a 7/10 on the Hoot And/Or Holler scale.

Now it's getting a re-release in just ten days and I'm fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4's first expansion will arrive sometime late in spaceyear 2024, but it's also a throwback to Diablo 2. That's because Vessel Of Hatred is all about one of the Prime Evils, Mephisto, who auld players would have slain in that most-beloved of hack-and-slashers.

"The objective is to run over babies in your minivan while shooting cops and other players. It's taking over the dark web... and IRL."
You don't need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good. Let's start now with Deadware, an unknown horror movie which does a great job recreating something a bit bad: a spOooky haunted browser game from 1999.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

Released today, it gives you a massive, gloomy map full of towering, greeny-black Gothic structures that are packed with backstory documents, but contain absolutely no enemies. The only thing separating you from all that winding, lore-drenched architecture is distance. Check out the trailer below.

        <id>121449</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025"/>
        <updated>2023-11-03T12:02:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great," Mazin told Deadline. "[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff."
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

Activision have now posted an explanation for the heavier footprint of this year's Call of Duty, while pointing out that you can customise your install to lighten the load.

While it's technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1's past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawed hero b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

But it ends this week, with Epic bringing players back to the Chapter 1 map for the next season of Chapter 4. Thanks to a new trailer released today, we know this throwback season is called Season OG, is a part of Chapter 4, and will be bringing with it a heavy dose of nostalgia.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a "talk" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled "Guerilla", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omni-Man, the J.K. Simmons-voiced character from the Invincible animated series, is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 next week on November 9. Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 


Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

        <updated>2023-11-02T13:11:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. 
Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk launches on December 14!

November 2, 2023
Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.
