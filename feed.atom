As an omnipresent robotic voice condescendingly wishes my team luck, my eyes widen in disbelief as a massive portal materializes over a city block. It spews hundreds of raptors that rain from the sky, tumbling down buildings before they sprint in our direction. It’s a jaw-dropping sight, but that awe turns to intimidation at the staggering number of adversaries thirsty for our blood. Our tank units move forward and activate their shields to create a defensive wall. A healer fills health bars to the brim. A sniper tak…]]></summary>

I’m not a competitive person by nature, and it’s a genre that is built around competition. The two times I really got into fighting games were a rivalry with my brother-in-law around Street Fighter II and another with a college friend over Soul Calibur 3. I still play them with some regularity, but I just have a hard time falling into them and continuing after beating the arcade mode a couple of times.
1997’s Bloody Roar was recommended to me a few times, but I only now got around to playing it. This is despite owning a copy of it, given to me by a friend who was cleaning out their basement. If I had known how firmly I would click with it, I would have definitely gotten around to it sooner.

This Campfire Chat primarily focuses on the upcoming 1.1.1. patch as part of their promise to provide balance changes and discussion before a patch rather than afterward.
My initial response is mostly positive. The Sorcerer changes are pretty monumental, offering improved survivability and removing some of the unnecessary annoyances the class has. But, we have to keep in mind just how disappointing patch 1.1.0 was across the board. It's never a net positive if you're taking one step forward but just recently took three steps back. Join me as we dive into the July 28 patch 1.1.1 Diablo 4 Campfire Chat recap.

In addition to that, there will also be a physical release of the two titles combined with the NES Double Dragon 1-3 as well as the modern Double Dragon IV. Unfortunately, the physical collection is Asia only.
Super Double Dragon is the fourth-ish title in the series. It was also the last one to be worked on by the series' original developer, Technos. Although, series director Yoshihisa Kishimoto did return for 2017’s Double Dragon IV. Which is funny to me because he is credited with working on Super Double Dragon. So Double Dragon IV isn’t really the fourth official title in the series? Agh, my head hurts.

And the Scions will be getting deeply involved with the local politics again, it seems. A competition for the throne is heating up, which draws the WoL and friends in, and may even see the Scions face off on opposite sides. It's intriguing, for sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A big MMORPG is making its way to Xbox consoles. Final Fantasy XIV is heading to Xbox Series X|S.
Xbox head Phil Spencer took the stage at Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest today alongside XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida to announce the news. It will have 4K support on Xbox Series X, and have "faster loading" too. An open beta is scheduled for 2024, during the 6.5X patch cycle. It will also be a digital-only release.
No mention was made of Xbox One, so it looks like that platform won't be getting access to Square Enix's MMORPG.
Spencer says he sees this as a "seminal moment" with the Final Fantasy team, and hopes to collaborate more with them in the future, which is sure to set speculation ablaze. Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu took the stage too, reaffirming a desire to collaborate more with Xbox. This could be interesting to see pan out, with the historically PlayStation-focused Final Fantasy series.
A new world
The Xbox news arrived during an information-filled Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest presentation. Yoshida and the XIV team unveiled its plans for 7.0, the Dawntrail expansion, which heads to the New World of Tural. A bunch of new content is coming, including two new DPS jobs.
And for those incoming Xbox players, the amount of XIV content immediately available is expanding too. The famous free trial of Final Fantasy XIV is expanding to include its Stormblood expansion. That's a ton of extra content for incoming Xbox players to dig into, or any aspiring Warriors of Light to check out on PC or PlayStation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV continues to deliver an info-packed Fanfest live from Las Vegas Nevada, and series producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida announced some really great news for prospective players: the free trial is getting an upgrade.
Yoshida mentioned that the trial will be coming with the release of patch 6.5, which is expected to go live sometime in September. As is the case with most patches (even smaller ones), Square Enix is very careful in terms of when it provides exact dates (or even windows) of when updates might drop. But even still, it's coming! And we won't have to wait until 2024's Dawntrail expansion to take advantage of it.
[caption id="attachment_394203" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Square Enix[/caption]
Square Enix has slowly made its Final Fantasy XIV free trial more generous over the years
Slowly but surely, Square Enix has been adding more expansions into the mix. Originally the free trial only included A Realm Reborn (back in 2014!), but it eventually expanded to Heavensward (in 2019), and now, Stormblood. It would stand to reason that Shadowbringers could arrive at some point. All you free players are in for a treat if that happens!
If you haven't dove into Final Fantasy XIV yet, we have a full guide on how to maximize your free trial here.
The Stormblood free trial is coming to Xbox, too
In case you missed it, Final Fantasy XIV is coming to Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox platforms will include the free trial:
"Additionally, you may have seen some copypasta lurking around the internet pertaining to a certain free trial… well, rest assured, the Final Fantasy XIV Online Expanded Free Trial will indeed be coming to Xbox Series X|S, meaning you too will be able to enjoy the entirety of A Realm Reborn as well as the award-winning Heavensward and Stormblood expansions up to level 70 with no restrictions on playtime!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S next spring. 
Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida on stage today, during Day 1 of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023, to reveal the news.
Here's what Spencer had to say:
Spencer says this is a seminal moment "in our relationship with you and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future," perhaps teasing more Final Fantasy to come to Xbox down the line. 
While the game will be playable on both Xbox Series X and Series S, Yoshida says only the Series X version will support 4K resolution. The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. 
This means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. 
For more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

While details about this new expansion remain relatively light, we did receive confirmation that two new jobs will come to the game with the launch of 7.0.
Director and Producer Naoki Yoshida announced on stage that both jobs will continue to fill out our DPS role options. Specifically, we'll see one melee DPS job as well as one magic ranged DPS join the game. These match the roles added when Stormblood came out in 2017, so we'll have to see if this marks a pattern for future expansions. Will a new Tank and Ranged DPS options come in 8.0?
While the job reveals may seem like business as usual, they do come in response to some community unrest. With 20 different jobs in the game, each …]]></summary>

The collaboration was teased in Fast X, with Toretto's kids playing the first Hot Wheels: Unleashed game at one point during the film.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. 
Square Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. 
Check out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: 


Yoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:
 














	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










Speaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. 
“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”

Originally set to launch in 2023, Rabbit & Bear is opting for some more time to deliver the RPG they want. Here's an excerpt from the Kickstarter backer update:
"In order to deliver a game that so many fans have supported, we announce a revised release date of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, with the game now due during Calendar Year Q2 of 2024. The decision was made in order to ensure the best possible story, and to reward the legion of backers with the best game experience possible."

That's a tiny fraction of the drive's original RRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded for this size. All told, it's a hugely impressive deal.

These controllers normally cost around £50 to £60, but today they're down to £40 – as part of a Sony summer sale that sees the Sony console drop from £479 to £399. 
There are a wide range of colours available, far beyond the white models that launched with the console in 2020. I'm a fan of the black and camouflage options, but there's also red, pink and blue. Here are links to Amazon and Currys, with the latter offering all colours apart from purple at £40 at the time of writing and Amazon only for black, white and blue.

In typical Nintendo fashion, the company this week shadow-launched not one, but two Legend of Zelda titles on the Nintendo Switch Online service.
The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages originally started life on the Game Boy back in 2001 by the now defunct Capcom subsidiary Flagship. The games remain fan favourites to this very day thanks to their ability to link up with one another via passwords, with Seasons opting for a more action-oriented approach and Ages focusing more on puzzle gameplay.

Or platformers, or double jumping, or dashing, or neon, or being alive in general. Dislike is the wrong word, but "weary neutrality" about covers my feelings when another retro platformer comes down the game tubes.
Gravity Circuit, however, is good enough that I can't not mention it here. It's loud and bright without being obnoxious or overwhelming, fast and precise without being overly demanding, and generally just a damn good effort at creating a modern action platformer whose main influence is obvious, but isn't just going through the motions for the sake of nostalgia. I'm saying it's good, yeah? Maybe not quite for me, but good anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PS5 launched in 2020 with a slew of promises, including faster loading times and a slew of eye-catching games. The system delivers many of those features, though feats such as 8K gaming remain a dream. Nevertheless, the public has clearly warmed to the PS5, and it is already celebrating 40 million units sold globally.
[caption id="attachment_394087" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]
A new milestone for the PS5
The PS5 initially launched at a bit of a tumultuous time. On one hand, the console may have benefited from COVID-19 quarantining which kept people at home. However, it also had to contend with the global microchip shortage which kept supply of the system well below demand.
Despite the obstacles, Sony has managed to sell over 40 million PS5s globally. To put things into perspective, the PS4 took 30 months to sell 40 million units after it launched in November 2013. The PS5 has achieved the feat in 32 months, which is about the same time.
The console sits ahead of classics such as the Xbox and GameCube, which both sold around 21 million units in their lifetimes. However, it still has a long way to go if it wants to surpass the PS4's 114 million units sold, the Switch with its incredible 125 million units, or the indomitable PS2 which has sold 159 million units worldwide.
This year, Sony has been keeping the console relevant with new peripheral hardware. The PS VR2 was released in February, and its library features titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Pavlov VR. Sony also plans to release the handheld streaming device codenamed Q, though time will tell how the public receives the curious gadget.

Everyone on the team has such varied, individual tastes, and it heartens me to see so many different genres and types of games represented every year. This year's list (available to read now in Part One and Part Two is another great testament to that. 
But as we (sometimes) jokingly say any time we compile a big list like this, the games that didn't make the cut are always at #101. Well, this year I thought supporters might like to see those games at #101 this year, and crikey, there are a lot. There are so many here, in fact, that we would have had to have stretched to an RPS 200 to include them all. So here are our honourable mentions this year (listed, for ease), and I'd love to see you try and guess which games belonged to which member of the team.

With Bergamo the flagship AMD EPYC 9754 provides 128 cores with SMT and the Zen 4C cores still boast AVX-512. Another nifty aspect on this high core count CPU catering to cloud service providers is the adjustable TDP from 320 to Watts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a decade-long hiatus, we finally have a new mainline Pikmin mainline entry in our hands. The adorable plant creatures are back, and this time they are joined by Oatchi the lovable rescue pup. Though the series has struggled a bit in the past, Pikmin 4 has made quite a splash since its launch, managing to reach the top of the Japan sales charts.
[caption id="attachment_394079" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]
Pikmin 4 has a successful launch
As revealed by Gemastu, Pikmin 4 has sold 401,853 physical copies in its first week. This strong opening surpasses the first-week sales of all three prior games combined. Nintendo has been doing a great job of keeping players Pikmin-crazy all year, as the Pikmin 1+2 bundle was made available on the Switch in June.
With Pikmin 4 at the number one spot, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom slides to second place on the Japan sales charts after several weeks at the top. Despite this, Link’s latest adventure still manages to sell exceedingly well, with 15,616 physical copies sold in Japan between July 17 and 23. This brings up the lifetime physical sales in Japan to 1,775,035.
For context, you can find the complete list below. Lifetime sales in brackets if applicable:
1: Pikmin 4 (Switch) – 401,853
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch) – 15,616 (1,775,035)
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Switch) - 10,749 (5,385,022)
Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening (Switch) - 10,633
Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening (PS4) - 10,434
Minecraft (Switch) - 7,512 (3,200,000)
Splatoon 3 (Switch) - 6,337 (4,066,350)
Nintendo Switch Sports (Switch) - 5,784 (1,131,645)
Final Fantasy 16 (PS5) - 4,904 (401,376)
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Switch) - 4,844 (5,239,500)
As usual, the Nintendo Switch dominates the sales charts. Though some are eager for a successor to the handheld, the charts illustrate that players are still getting plenty of life out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ravenage Games has dropped their ‘80s throwback dual-stick shooter, Mega City Police, on PC today. You can nab it on Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.
Mega City Police is really nostalgic for the ‘80s. You play as legally distinct versions of various action heroes and dole out justice from the end of their guns. Every scene in the trailer is depicted under a CRT filter, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
https://youtu.be/lsYhwmKWqXo
Mega City Police comes touting eight playable characters with 16 different abilities. More impressively, it has more than 100 weapons and upgrades! I’m not sure if that is “100 weapons including upgrades” or “100 weapons that you can upgrade.” This is played underneath the pulsing tones of a synth-wave soundtrack. It’s also a roguelite, which I know means that half of you stopped reading. For those of you that remain, the levels are procedurally assembled, and there’s “a robust progression system.”
I can dig its vibes. I like dual-stick shooters and synth-wave. However, what really stands out to me in the trailer is the character selection screen. I just want to hang around in that police station. Those donuts look great.
Mega City Police is available today on Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store. Following release, Ravenage Games has announced that “the game will get 5 free expansions with new secret levels, agents, and couch coop.”

This review originally went live in 2013, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy / Game Boy Color library.

Ever since The Legend of Zelda released on the NES, Nintendo has played the franchise relatively close to its chest. Series creator Shigeru Miyamoto has had a hand in almost every release to date, and before the new millennium, Nintendo EAD handled development of each and every Zelda title. But when Nintendo wanted an all-new Zelda trilogy for the ageing Game Boy Color, it reached out to Flagship, a Capcom development team specialising in creating game scenarios and story development.

This review originally went live in 2013, and we're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy / Game Boy Color library.

The combat of The Legend of Zelda series has seen several iterations over the decades. The classic top-down gameplay of the original was morphed into a faster, action-heavy side-scroller with Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, only to be abandoned for a return to form in A Link to the Past. While the promise of 3D worlds and Z-targeting eventually led Nintendo to abandon the classic top-down approach on consoles (Four Swords aside), traditional Zelda design lived on in the handheld realm. From Link's Awakening to Minish Cap, Link's overhead adventures continued, and sandwiched between these two were the interlinked Oracle games on the Game Boy Color.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're edging ever closer to the release of Starfield. Bethesda's long-awaited sci-fi game has been a source of scrutiny and deep dives pretty much since day one. Using all the screenshots, teasers, and any other information that's out there, fans have managed to piece together a detailed map of this unreleased title, which includes a 1,000-page compendium.
Starfield fans are thorough, is the long and the short of it. But someone has recently discovered that the RPG may not be the perfect culmination of years of development after all, as it turns out there's a very small spelling error.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/15aqomq/starfield_state_of_the_at/
In a post over on Reddit, user Ambitious_Back4748 has uploaded a screenshot from Starfield which shows a close-up of a pretty meaty gun. However, one particular aspect of this weapon has been circled. When the image is zoomed in, you can see the words "State of the at Weapon Frame." Presumably, this should read "State of the art."
Cancel your pre-orders, everyone!
It's a very tiny error, but it's just one more proof that dedicated gamers pay a lot of attention to marketing material. If you want to check out which bit this very specific screenshot is from, you can watch the Starfield Direct video, which went live a month ago.
You still need to be pretty quick on the pause button, though. The actual close-up of the gun happens for barely a second at around the 39:12 mark. Seriously, it's one that can be so easily missed, it's a wonder anyone spotted it at all.
Whether Bethesda will rectify this spelling mistake or not remains to be seen. Still, it's not as if it's going to tarnish the already immense hype surrounding one of the biggest releases of this generation. Gamers aren't that finicky, right?
Starfield will be launching on September 6 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.

Call of Duty Season 5 gets hip
Season 5 of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone begins on August 2 at 9 AM PT across all platforms. As part of the franchise's celebration of 50 years of hip-hop, everyone who logs in between August 7 and 16 on four separate days will receive free hip-hop War Tracks from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s. 
Additionally, new operators will be added in Call of Duty Season 5, and some of them will please hip-hop fans. Snoop Dogg's operator will be available, and he is seen holding a custom blue rifle. This isn't the first time the rapper has teamed up with Call of Duty, as in 2014 he lent his voice talents to the franchise.
Nicki Minaj will also be available, making the pink-haired rapper the franchise's first-ever self-named female operator. An operator bundle featuring rapper 21 Savage is also planned.
With Season 5, the Prestige Rank cap will be raised from 17 to 21, and the new maximum level cap will be 1050. Reach Prestige Rank 21, and you'll receive an exclusive Kastov-74u Weapon Blueprint.
Modern Warfare 2 was a hit for the franchise, becoming the fastest title in the Call of Duty series to generate $1 billion in revenue. Continued updates with surprising twists will ensure the user base remains active.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs have just revealed Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, the follow-up to its 2021 Super Smash Bros.-inspired brawler All-Star Brawl.
On top of all the memes that you can spot right now in the trailer, publisher GameMill Entertainment announces it has improved upon the original game in every way. The original character roster and stages are returning, and they've all gone through a mega glow-up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDlOIc9HsyA
What's new in the All-Star Brawl?
There's also going to be a lot of new stuff. Expect new characters, mini-games, and even a whole new single-player campaign. Both Squidward and Jimmy Neutron are confirmed for the roster this time around, too.
In the campaign, players will be up against Vlad Plasmius of Danny Phantom fame as he tries to conquer the whole universe. The daunting task will hopefully turn easier with the addition of new "Supers", which similar to the "Final Smash" moves from Super Smash Bros., are ultimate moves meant to get rid of your foes in epic fashion.
The new minigames are Pinch the Blimps, Whack-a-Bot, and Irken Armada Bootcamp Survival. We still don't know what their gameplay will be like exactly. We do know, however, that you can play them either with friends or by yourself against the world as you strive to get to the top of the global leaderboard.
All characters in All-Star Brawl 2 will now have voices, which is nice, as the first game received criticism for its lack of voices. All-Star Brawl 2 will feature talent like Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke from SpongeBob SquarePants.
All-Star Brawl 2 comes out later this year. It will also have full cross-platform play for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Playstation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.

Players can download the game’s 1.10 patch today, which brings a few key balance changes to The Lands Between.
As far as overall balance goes, we have a few buffs to critical hits (i.e. what happens when you backstab). Not only are these moves wholesale stronger, but they now inflict greater poise damage as well. We also have “decreased recovery time after a missed critical hit” listed here. It's a merry crit-mas from FromSoftware.
That said, this patch also brings a few PvP adjustments. Three of the six changes focus on poise adjustments, and the skills “Quick Step” and “Hound’s Step” have decreased invulnerability windows. This se…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has reminded us that Two Point Campus is a whole-year-old with a celebration. From now until July 31st, you can play the weird post-secondary institution simulator for free on Steam. There’s also a sale if you decide you want to be BFFs with it.
Two Point Campus is the follow-up to Two Point Studios’ 2018 Two Point Hospital. Rather than endanger lives by performing surgery with undertrained staff, Two Point Campus has you setting youthful education seekers up for life by saddling them with insurmountable debt. You do so by putting them through wacky courses to polish up their culinary and archeology skills.
The sale on Two Point Campus isn’t just for the PC version. The PlayStation (August 2-16) and Xbox (now until August 7) ports are also getting discounted 50%. No word on the Switch. The two DLC expansions are also on sale and can be bought in a bundle.
It’s well worth it. Not only did I give it high marks in my review of it last year, but I also selected it for a place on my prestigious Top 10 Picks of 2022 list. Every time a new DLC pack drops, I eagerly pick it up again. Something about the weird Two Point universe of daft, hapless puppet-people keeps me coming back. Speaking of which, I feel like we’re due for another expansion. I’m surprised one wasn’t announced alongside the celebration.
Two Point Campus is available on PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5.

        <updated>2023-07-27T19:00:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital has announced that The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood will come out on August 16. This is the new game by Deconstructeam, the studio behind hits such as Gods Will Be Watching and The Red Strings Club, so expectations are set for another narrative hit.
https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1684217007456280576?s=20
But what is The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood?
The beginning of the trailer is reminiscientof a kind of magical realism we see in games such as Kentucky Route Zero. Still, The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood doesn't waste time revealing that it'll be even more magical than expected.
It tells the story of Fortuna, a witch who lived in exile on an asteroid until she made a pact with some sort of space devil to gain back her freedom. She then reunites with her coven on Earth and goes on a mystical journey through space and time, where she'll come to terms with her abilities and responsibilities.
The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is a narrative adventure. It'll put a lot of emphasis on the journey and relationships with Fortuna's coven and with the friends she'll make along the way, but it will also feature more technical gameplay elements.
[caption id="attachment_393923" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Image by Devolver Digital[/caption]
Gods Will Be Witching
Fortuna is an arcane witch. She can craft special tarot-like cards that will grant her the ability to revisit the past and foresee various possible futures for the people she meets. This mechanic will invite us to have a positive impact on the lives of every character she comes in contact with. Will we make things better?
It seems like we might be looking at one of those games that you'll have to replay a few times to finally get that perfect ending, and that's great.
The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood will release on Nintendo Switch and PC on August 16. Pre-ordering it on Steam will get you 10% off.

The application details a design for "Facial Age Estimation," used to guess the age of users using the front-facing camera of a cell phone. Reports of this application soon followed, speculating that the ESRB might use this technology to scan children's faces and verify their ages.
However, the ESRB recently responded to these statements, saying it would not be used for this reason. Instead, the ratings board says this tech is going to be used for parental consent when signing up for new games.

Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, released in 2021, was one of the more successful - although criticism seemed to focus on its high price and relative paucity of characters and stages.

Does that make it a good or a bad thing that Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is in development, then? It'll feature new stages and new characters, while revamping the look and layouts from the original. Among the new characters is Spongebob's perma-frustrated neighbour Squidward, who you can see in the announcement trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The time has come once again for another fabled third party Switch exclusive to hit the eShop, and this time, we're getting Disney Ilusion Island. We actually have a full review up for it, so if you're interested, check it out! It's a particularly interesting game in that it offers up four player co-op with difficulty sliders for individual players. In other words, it's made for the whole family.
Other bigger releases include Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons (which we also have a review for!), as well as Venba (which is described as a "wholesome narrative cooking game set in the 1980s," which is going to ignite a lot of interest).

As has become something of a yearly occurrence, it looks like Pokémon cards will once again be returning to McDonald's Happy Meals within the next month (thanks, Eurogamer).
In some European countries, the promotion has begun today (27th July) with 15 different Pokémon cards up for grabs with the purchase of a Happy Meal. It looks like the UK will be getting the offer a little bit later — 23rd August, according to Pokémon fansite PokéBeach — but either way, it's happening folks, prepare yourselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Camlann Games has announced its unique take on the 4X genre with Ataxia, a cyberpunk crimelord simulator.
Do you like crime? Do you like dystopian future crime? It’s okay. You can tell me. I’m not a dystopian future cop. Honest. If those things sound like they itch your interest, then Ataxia might be the game for you. In it, you take control of a gang and expand, exploit, exterminate, and possibly explore a neon-drenched sprawl. I don’t know, the “explore” is part of 4X, and I don’t see much room for that in a city. Maybe Google Maps doesn’t exist in the future.
https://youtu.be/o31aKiAnpBY
The trailer gives an idea of what to expect, but since Ataxia isn’t scheduled to launch until late 2024, it’s still quite early in its development. You can expect “espionage, extortion, hacking, money laundering, or more.” You can also customize your gang with weapons and chrome to give them an edge in combat. Then, you can spend your ill-gotten loot to buy or construct buildings in the city.
I’m personally a fan of crime simulator games, since no one seems to pay attention to all the real crime that I do. These games help me feel “seen,” you know. Ataxia is looking like it scratches both my crimelord and cyberpunk itches.
Ataxia is currently slated for release on PC sometime in late 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not exactly scrap.
Q-Games’ PixelJunk series, essentially an umbrella name for their indie game output, is now in its second chapter. With little to no correlating factors, each game is largely a standalone work, with PixelJunk Racers, for example, being a Micro Machines-style overhead racing title, while PixelJunk Shooter is a subterranean search and rescue experience.
PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe is an expanded version of PixelJunk Scrappers from 2020; a clean-looking 2D arcade-strategy title geared around junk collecting. In a future post-apocalypse, trash has become a currency and is fought for by rival gangs lining their pockets with other people’s refuse. This isn’t particularly logical, of course, because if junk was equal to gold nobody would ever throw anything out, but, in the world of PixelJunk: Scrappers Deluxe, the streets are lined with discarded objects in the upper and lower extremities of side-scrolling city stages.

With all the drama surrounding the company's bankruptcy in 2018, followed by its acquisition by LCG Entertainment in 2019, it's fair to have some doubts. Furthermore, Deck Nine are the developers. While they have experience with narrative-driven games, will this even feel like a Telltale game? Well, I can tell you that answer is yes. And while I'd never dare try to dethrone The Wolf Among Us, I will tell you this: The Expanse is shaping up to be one of the best Telltale Games titles yet.
I should start by saying I am a huge fan of The Expanse. The SyFy/Amazon Prime series is genuinely in my top three TV shows of all time, maybe even number one. I have to admit that when I first discovered the details behin…]]></summary>

Update: Netflix has shared some more details on the upcoming Castlevania: Nocturne series starring Richter Belmont. The eight-episode season will drop in its entirety on 28th September 2023, and we'll be able to return to the stunning animation of the Castlevania Netflix universe.
Set during the French Revolution, the show is largely an original tale, it will take inspiration from Castlevania: Rondo of Blood (which takes place in 1972), and its direct sequel Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Richter joins forces with Maria, a young revolutionary leader who is attempting to fight against inequality. Except there's been an uprising in vampire activity recently — and Richter, who carries his family's tradition of vampire hunting — suspects it may be to do with the death of his mother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although not much into development these days, there was a time when Valve made some fantastic games. Right from the word "go" - with the release of Half-Life in 1998 - Gabe Newell and his team became an overnight success. As such, the first entry in the adventures of the silent scientist Gordon Freeman continues to be talked about a quarter of a century later.
For example, there's been some curiosity over the inspiration for some of Half-Life's NPCs, specifically the scientists who aid Freeman. One that typically sticks out is the older physicist with the mustache and white, "mad scientist" hairstyle.
[caption id="attachment_393794" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Sketchfab.[/caption]
Naturally, many people assumed this Half-Life character was based off Albert Einstein. They're both somewhat into science, after all, so it made sense. However, that doesn't appear to be the case.
The founding father...of Black Mesa?
In a report from TheGamer, it turns out that the labcoat-wearing NPC with the white 'do was not inspired by the world's most famous scientist.
According to Chuck Jones, the 3D artist who designed Gordon Freeman, this particular character was actually based off George Washington. "The one you mentioned that looked like Einstein? I think I got the inspiration from George Washington (weird haircut)—not sure why," Jones told TheGamer.
Additionally, G-Man—the mysterious government agent who follows the player throughout the facility—was inspired by the Cigarette Man from X-Files. The show was at its most popular back in the '90s, so it's not surprising that it would come under Valve and Half-Life's radar.
It's interesting how a theoretical physicist with a white haircut was not actually based off Albert Einstein. It begs the question of whether fans will start referring to him as "George" instead.

Specifically the big, daft chunky guns that she worked on, but also about videogame guns in general - what makes them tick. What separates a good one from a bad one. Whether or not Doom 3’s shotgun is one of the good ones (it is).  


If there’s one area where all of the remake’s ideas truly come together and shine, it’s in the weapons. There wasn’t much to see in the original - nothing beyond the tip of a barrel. Here, the weapons are very much the star of the show. Heavy, industrial things covered in thumb-print smeared LCD screens and superfluous greeblies. NERF guns that've been painted by a 12-year-old and covered in spaceship parts. These are the toy guns you would have wanted for Christmas, and I wanted to know more about them.

Sonic Mania is heralded by many of the blue blur's fans as one of the best Sonic games ever made. A sequel was a dream for many — more classic stages revamped, more brand new levels created, and those buttery smooth physics making a beautiful pixel art return. However, Sonic Mania 2 never happened, but we've got a clearer picture as to why.
In an interview with Game Informer — whose cover story is the next 2D Sonic game, Sonic Superstars — Sega's Takashi Iizuka put to bed rumours of creative differences between Sonic Mania's developer Headcannon, headed up by Christian Whitehead, and Sega. Iizuka says that Sega worked with Headcannon and Whitehead "to consider concepts for the next generation of Classic Sonic", but the game never came to fruition.

Unpacking, a game where you click on items and shelve them nicely, has somehow tamed my urge to punch the boxes open. Except it's done one thing to personally attack me, and that's by not allowing me to unpack stuff and leave it on the floor. It's a fight I simply can't win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. 
Sony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. 


That’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.
However, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.


SEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it:

At least for a bit, and just in time for Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind (a spiritual successor to King Of Dragon Pass) to to get a depressing-sounding sequel and Myst to get a Humble Bundle featuring its sequels, both official and spiritual. So that got us to thinking: what in the darn heck is a spiritual successor anyway? Are there standard parameters? We have a definitional argument, as is our wont.


Plus: we've been playing a clutch of games that are both fun to talk about and current, James instigates a discussion about whether SSDs should be considered the default over mechanical hard drives, and Nate does a mini-game contest that is literally just about fish and has no relation to games whatsoever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Entropy Centre is now available on Switch, and you can pick it up from the Nintendo eShop for 50% off, thanks to a special launch day discount. 
If you like a good puzzle game, especially if you’re a fan of Valve’s Portal series, The Entropy Centre is worth your time. It was one of my favorite games of last year, and you can read about why in my review of The Entropy Centre. With today’s launch day discount on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase The Entropy Centre for $12.49. 
Check out the Nintendo Switch launch trailer for The Entropy Centre below: 


The Switch version of The Entropy Centre arrives less than a year after the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions launched last November. In the game, players take on the role of protagonist Aria, who awakens inside a colossal space station just outside of a constantly exploding Earth. It’s up to you to figure out why this space station – The Entropy Centre – has been abandoned, why Earth keeps exploding, and why your day resets afterward. You’ll do all this alongside Astra, a talking gun with a great sense of humor. 
For more about the game, watch this gameplay trailer and then read Game Informer’s review of The Entropy Centre.

        <updated>2023-07-27T14:33:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been playing Phasmophobia for a while now, you'll know that developer Kinetic Games has been planning a big update. Essentially, the team is looking to reset all progress for players, ready for what is being referred to as the "Progression" update, which was due to be coming in three stages from July onwards.
However, the studio is putting a slight pause on this, with "Progression 1" now being pushed back two weeks so it can be given "a bit more love and care." That's according to the most recent piece of correspondence from Kinetic over on the Phasmophobia Discord channel, which was then reiterated on Twitter.
https://twitter.com/KineticGame/status/1683799768668205058
The team wants to make sure it remains transparent about the game and says that the update should be ready to roll out mid-August.
What about the console port?
The good news is that this delay should not impede the release of the console version of Phasmophobia. The message on Discord says that a late August release is still on track, so that's good news for you Xbox Series X|S and PS5 users.
On top of that, the developer is urging people to "keep an eye out" for some "sneak peaks" into something else that's on the way. So that's something to look forward to while we wait that tiny bit longer for the update.
It's been an interesting journey for Phasmophobia. A roadmap shows that Kinetic clearly has plenty of ideas in mind for its co-op ghost-hunting game. It's nice to see the developer is always looking to improve on the formula, and it's great that console players will finally get to see what PC horror fans have been raving about for nearly three years.

However, Axiom isn’t the only concern, as players must also fight through Umbral, the realm of the dead.

I’m personally more of a Blake Stone girl, myself.
However, despite the way its development started and the shortcomings of its engine, the powerful collection of developers who crafted it has ensured that Rise of the Triad still carried with it a unique personality.

Disney Illusion Island puts Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy front and center in a Metroidvania adventure, and the result is mostly successful. Where most platformers dole out fun using the adrenaline-inducing triumph of challenge, Illusion Island is instead built around the joy of movement, thanks in part to its combat-less exploration, and the delight of controlling some of the most recognizable mascots in the world. It plays a bit floaty and simple, especially for seasoned fans of the genre, and I wanted my platforming prowess pushed more, but Illusion Island is still a…]]></summary>

Double Dragon may be one of the original pillars of the beat ‘em up genre, but that foundation has weakened in modern times. Infrequent sequels of varying quality have tested Jimmy and Billy Lee’s modern relevance, but Double Dragon Gaiden does a solid job of reinventing the pair with a neat tag team mechanic. Though as enjoyable as this contemporary throwback can be, it often gets in its own way with frustrating combat design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online can now access two of the most beloved Game Boy Color games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. 
As was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.
The Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.
To see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.]]></summary>

So much so that it seemed inevitable that a sequel developed in conjunction with Christian Whitehead, PagodaWest Games, and Headcannon would be next for the Blue Blur. Unfortunately, it never happened. We asked both Takashi Iizuka and Christian Whitehead what happened to Sonic Mania 2. 
Headcannon continued working with the Sonic brand through 2022's Sonic Origins and its 2023 update Sonic Origins Plus, while Whitehead founded his own studio, Evening Star, alongside fellow Sonic Mania developers in 2018. This past June, Evening Star announced its first game, titled Penny's Big Breakaway, coming in early 2024.

Intel's AVX10 announcement noted initial support with Granite Rapids processors that will debut next year but no mention of the E-core-only Sierra Forest. With the AVX10 only coming to P/E core client processors after Granite Rapids, it would appear the high density Sierra Forest generation will miss out on AVX10/AVX-512 and not appear until Clearwater Forest. Meanwhile with the 128-core AMD EPYC "Bergamo" processors now shipping, there is AVX-512 with the Zen 4C cores. Here are some benchmarks looking at the AVX-512 impact for Bergamo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ideally, the story of Remnant II’s launch would start and end with it being an ambitious success of a shooty Soulslike. Sadly not: in a Reddit post addressing complaints of wonky performance, even on higher-end graphics cards, developers Gunfire Games admitted to having "designed the game with upscaling in mind." 
Working the likes of Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS into a game wouldn’t normally be a cause of incredulity. Indeed, as optional performance boosters, they’re pretty much always a welcome sight amid the duller texture filtering and ambient occlusion toggles of the average settings menu. The problem here is that with its dismal performance at native, non-upscaled resolutions, Remnant II essentially forgets about the 'optional' part – and in doing so, undermines what makes DLSS and its rivals such valuable tools in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Under the new rights holders Studio 2.21, cult classic series Little Big Adventure was set to make a comeback after three decades off-grid, with original creator Didier Chanfray attached to the projects. The comeback plans included an all-new reboot, plus remasters for the two 1990s action-adventure games. But today, the studio announced that they were “unsuccessful in securing a publisher,” which has led to the reboot’s cancellation and layoffs at the developer.


“Despite our earnest efforts,” CEO Ben Limare wrote in a blog post, “we were unsuccessful in securing a publisher for the reboot of Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure.” According to Limare, the reasons for this are threefold: genre appeal, the series’ limited recognition, and the planned costs. “Despite a passionate, albeit small, community of fans, Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure isn’t globally recognized, which added to the hesitations of potential publishers,” wrote Limare.


“While indie game studios can often deliver remarkable games with lean teams (as we've seen with Death’s Door and Tunic), our vision for this project involved a team of 15 to 20 people, echoing the original game's size,” he continued. “This considerable investment, juxtaposed with the risk inherent to the genre and IP, was a factor in the decision.”

But I bloody love tidying things in games. Getting everything in the right place. And something that makes it extra enjoyable in Unpacking is the sound design. The house itself is quiet, but everything in the game makes a little noise when you put it away or hang it up or slide it in a shelf, and it's all stuff you recognise from home. It makes the whole experience feel domestic and familiar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“This is gonna be fun!” exclaims Sweet Tooth as he lobs his machete towards Anthony Mackie’s John Doe, who narrowly dodges the weapon as it careens into a casino slot machine.
I’m not sure I agree with the iconic murder clown. I’m watching the first teaser for Peacock’s Twisted Metal, and while I wasn’t sure what to expect from an adaptation of one of my favorite childhood franchises, whatever hopes I had fell away watching this strange out-of-context clip. Sweet Tooth dancing to and singing the lyrics to Sisqó’s “Thong Song?” Showing a comedic fistfight instead of vehicles blowing each other up? I know the showrunners are aiming for laughs, but what have they done to my game?
After watching the show’s first season, I must confess: I really like Twisted Metal.

So, in an evening spare of stuff to do, I booted the game up and created a druid called ANIMALS. After a few hours of pressing 1,3,2,4, in either the same pattern or different patterns, I've come to realise the game doesn't make me feel anything. I bash some skeletons, I equip a staff, I exit to Windows, I couldn't care less. Maybe, though, it's not such a bad thing?
I know I said I'd like Diablo 4 to channel Vampire Survivors and give me an auto-attack switch, so I could just steer my character through encounters without having to think at all. I still stand by my stubbornness! But having obliterated more packs of rabid wolves and legions of demons, I've come to develop what I think is ARPG muscle memory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red have announced another batch of layoffs, this time affecting “around 100” employees, or roughly 9% of the company’s total headcount. The redundancies won’t take place immediately, according to CDPR, as some employees won’t lose their jobs until early next year at the latest.


“There’s no easy way to say this, but today we are overstaffed,” said CEO Adam Kiciński in an ‘organisational update’ posted to the company’s website. “We have talented people on board who are finishing their tasks and — based on current and expected project needs — we already know we don’t have other opportunities for them in the next year,” he continued. 


“To meet our own high expectations and ambitions to create the best role-playing games, we not only want to have the best people but also the right teams,” says Kiciński. “What we mean by that is having teams that are built around our projects’ needs; teams that are more agile and more effective… After reshaping our development process and incorporating Agile methodologies, we’re now focusing on refining the shape of our teams.” Those projects in question include another Witcher trilogy, a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and an all-new IP codenamed Project Hadar. That’s in addition to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 expansion called Phantom Liberty.

The original Remnant: From the Ashes was a surprise success thanks to its Souls-inspired action combined with third-person shooting and randomized environments. The sequel is a refinement with new environments and expanded lore. I enjoyed my time with the game and its final boss and the shooting mechanics feel great, but Remnant II ultimately doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the genres and games that inspired it.

The announcement of Sonic Superstars sparked excitement among the fan base thanks to the return to the 2D style of gameplay found in the beloved retro entries in the franchise but complemented with gorgeous modern visuals. The game plays very much like an homage to those games that primarily lived on the Genesis, but developers Arzest and Sonic Team are adding various new elements to Sonic Superstars to expand on the classic gameplay fans are looking forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know how some games are notebook games? Well, The Banished Vault is a manual game, no two ways about it. Sure, you could theoretically make meticulous notes about all the planetary symbols and construction costs of the various buildings you'll need to harvest and convert resources into fuel, alloys and elixirs as you hurtle through space trying to escape the terrifying Gloom based on its in-game manual. But when there's a physical paper booklet that replicates all that for you in a much more easily accessible format, with several gorgeous illustrations of its mysterious space monastery to boot, not to mention infinitely better explanations of what everything does than I could ever hope to describe, it's quickly become an essential part of my play experience. 
I'm still working on my review for The Banished Vault (hopefully coming later this week), but as it launches on Steam today, I'd strongly recommend spending the extra £5/$5 to get one if you're at all interested in Lunar Division's space survival management 'em up. I don't think I could have survived in the game without it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I sat down with GGRecon for a roundtable-ish interview with Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon director Masaru Yamamura and producer Yasunori Ogura to talk more about their upcoming mecha action game. And their answers gave us more of an insight into the game's early development, where the story might take you, and how you might overcome some of its trickiest nuts and bolts.
While it won't come as much of a surprise to Armored Core veterans, Armored Core 6 isn't an open world game. If you're a new FromSoftware-liker brought on board by the expansive world of Elden Ring, then yes, you might be a bit surprised. As I mention in my preview, Armored Core 6 sees you play a mecha-mercenary who selects jobs from a drop down menu and jets off to destroy whatever needs destroying. But Yamamura says FromSoft actually considered going down a more open world route in early stages of the game's development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a trusty can of Red Bull coursing through my veins and my heart rate pounding like a jackhammer, I spent around three hours with Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon's first chapter. And rather like Red Bull's metallic fizz of aspartame and rocket fuel, I'd say the game shares a similar makeup. It doesn't give you wings, but what it does give you is a mech as nimble as a Eurasian Blue Tit darting at a confetti of stale bread.
As a historic mech-disliker, the game actually managed to instil a desire to become a skilled mech pilot. I want to buy new metal legs and attach gatling guns to my spine! But I'm apprehensive about the grind to get those parts and whether some of AC6's Souls influences clash with its rapid pace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hardest part of being a director is getting out of the car in the morning, John Johanas says. Not literally. He takes the train to work every day. But being a director requires turning a switch in his brain. He's an introvert. But when he goes to work, he has to be an extrovert. He has to lead teams, micromanage, make tough decisions, and accept making mistakes – all skills he says he learned without clear guidance. 
To be able to do that, to make that switch, Johanas says you need to be a "weird psychopath." Though he likes to think he isn't a weird psychopath. "Maybe to some people I am," he says. "I don't know." Nevertheless, no one can be at that level all the time. And yet, here he is. 
So yeah, the hardest part of the day is getting out of the metaphorical car to go into his job …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is one of the most anticipated RPGs of the year and even graced Game Informer’s cover back in March. While the game is heading to all platforms, its playable demo has only been available on Switch. Today, it’s PlayStation fans’ turn to sample the upcoming title.
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that you can download the demo on PlayStation consoles, which unfolds in an out-of-context, spoiler-free slice of the game. Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. 
Sea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  
Sea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can learn by checking out our exclusive coverage hub with features such as an interview with Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda about the soundtrack he crafted for the game. We also have a video interview with creative director Thierry Boulanger breaking down Sea of Stars’ RPG inspirations.]]></summary>

I am furious because none of you told me Alan Wake is essentially Garth Marenghi in his Twin Peaks era, and if you had I would have played it ages ago. The game is such a knowing snake ball of mating tropes that it ouroboroses round into being brilliant, flawless, ridiculous. And also Alan is a terrible writer, I would hate his books. But also everyone should leave him alone because he's doing his best.

Blue Protocol, an anime MMO developed by Bandai Namco that's already out in Japan, and is due out in the West sometime in 2024. I played it for an hour and I've come away thinking it's a slick operation, with some slight Monster Hunter edge to its combat. While the future sounds promising, questions remain around a world which seems a bit eh, and the ever looming march of the microtransactions.

“Whenever I think about the future of Techland, I want the best for our games, the team, and you,” said Techland’s CEO Paweł Marchewka in today’s blog post. “And while I am very proud of our achievements as an independent studio over all these years, I believe the best is yet to come.”


Marchewka continued to say that “teaming up with Tencent” would allow the team to “move full speed ahead” with future plans for the Dying Light series and their in-development fantasy RPG. Marchewka emphasised that the studio will retain “full ownership” of their intellectual property and “maintain creative freedom.” Marchewka will also continue to serve as Techland’s CEO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three decades have gone by since the original Myst graced the world, providing endless online debates about whether it's smart or just pretentious. Magical or plain bad. Some indie developers chose the latter with a Myst FPS remix that spoofed the senior adventure game. The RPS readership seemed split on the subject when we asked "Have You Played Myst?" years ago. But Humble Games leans toward the former as it’s choosing to celebrate the classic's whopping 30th birthday with a returning charity bundle, available now until August 3rd.


The Humble Myst & More Bundle packages the titular point-and-clicker, alongside several other sequels, spiritual successors, and odd offshoots from developer Cyan Worlds. You can pay anything over £7.80/$10 for the 11-game bundle, or you can pay at least £15.60/$20 to also grab the Myst remake from 2021. 


Cyan Worlds loves a good re-release, and this latest bundle is a reminder of how many Mysts have Mysted over the years. There’s Myst: Masterpiece Edition which remasters the music and imagery, and is otherwise as close to the original as you can get. Then there’s realMyst: Masterpiece Edition which added changing weather, day-night cycles, free roam movement, and a bonus epilogue. And finally, there’s the most recent pretty remake that’s also compatible with VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light developer, Techland has announced a partnership with Tencent that will see the massive Chinese holdings company become the studio’s majority shareholder.
In a blog post penned by Techland founder and CEO Paweł Marchewka, he explains the studio has partnered with Tencent for support of its continued expansion of the Dying Light series and to ensure its upcoming fantasy RPG lives up to expectations.
“Teaming up with Tencent will allow us to move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games,” Pawel writes. “We have chosen an ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things.”
Pawel states that he will remain CEO, and Techland will retain full ownership of its IPs. He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.
This is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others.

As someone who grew up primarily in the 1990s, I’ve played more than my fair share of 2D platformers. With those decades of experience, it’s no surprise that I consider myself a relatively strong platforming player. However, despite its precise controls, Mr. Run and Jump’s challenging, neon-bathed obstacle courses and hard-to-reach collectibles had me second-guess my skills at every step.
Developed initially as a homebrew Atari 2600 game, Mr. Run and Jump errs on the side of simplicity with i…]]></summary>

The fast-paced, swashbuckling fights are endless fun, and the sun-kissed towns were a treat for the eyes, but it was honestly swoon at first sight when I first saw Adalia de Volador.
What can I say, folks? I'm in love. Let me list everything I adore about Adalia like this is my high school diary. She’s an amazing sword fighter; her acrobatic and graceful nature lets her outwit anyone who crosses her blade. She’s got panache, cheek, and a sharp wit to boot. And speaking of - her boots! Her hat! Her cape! She’s got endless style! And when she punts a soldier off a dock ledge and into the sea, my heart skips a beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developer of Dusk, David Szymanski, has announced his next game. Instead of riffing on mid-90s strafe shooters, Butcher's Creek is inspired by early-'00s video game nasties like Manhunt and Condemned: Criminal Origins. Put another way, you'll "use rusty tools to brutalize a gang of serial torturers in the remote Appalachian Forest", and view it all through the fuzz of a VHS filter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4's major 1.1.0a balance patch was released this week and was met with sweeping criticism, specifically for the way it seemed to reduce the power and usefulness of some character builds. In a livestream yesterday, Blizzard acknowledged the feedback, calling the patch "not the greatest play experience", and saying they wouldn't release a patch like it again.

What's missing from most reports is practical information that might help people to understand and then accept the risks beyond simple blind faith.

Madden NFL 24 brings new improvements to the FieldSense system, Franchise, Superstar, and even the skeletons of the on and off-field character models. Not only that but this year signals the return of the popular minigames that have been missing for many years. 
However, one of the biggest announcements each year comes in the form of the player ratings heading into the new season.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the news that Assassin’s Creed Mirage won’t get any post-launch DLC, we of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast are wondering: what are some good games that only need playing once? Not out of a lack of enjoyment or interest, but because they were so satisfying that they left nothing else to want. Or because it would be too hard to recapture the joy of a first playthrough. Or maybe because they just ended really damn well. Whatever the reasoning, join us as we ponder our favourite games that we’ve never returned to.


Plus! We chat about the games we have been playing, from Nate’s eel-dense management adventures in Clanfolk to my wilfully patch note-ignorant return to Minecraft. I also explain Team Fortress 2’s new seal mode, and Nate hijacks my thrilling hardware section on EU battery legislation to improvise a new trip up the Tower of Jocularity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on the shooter series of the same name, the Borderlands film now has an official release date: August 9th, 2024. The action-comedy adaptation wrapped principal shooting in 2021, but it’s been somewhat stuck in post-production limbo ever since with several rounds of reshoots pushing out the release further than expected. 


This comes after reports that co-writer Craig Mazin - best known as the showrunner behind HBO’s The Last Of Us and Chornobyl - removed his name from the project in favour of a pseudonym. More recently, Mazin confirmed to Variety that the pen name reports were false and he’s instead “not a credited writer” on Borderlands at all anymore. Mazin is instead focusing on The Last Of Us’ second season.


The Borderlands was mostly directed by Eli Roth, known for his work on the Hostel films and Cabin Fever. Roth was reportedly busy during reshoots, however, so studio Lionsgate enlisted the help of Tim Miller, the director behind Deadpool, to helm the project for a few weeks.

There's a time-travelling detective story at the heart of it, in which you and a very Minority Report-style AI work together to stop crimes that will disrupt the one true timeline throughout history, and it's all played out on gorgeous black and white tableaus like Adriaan de Jongh's wonderful Hidden Folks. You'll rewind and fast forward time to plot suspicious movements, track stolen objects as they move across town, and work out who (or what) is causing all this chaos. I'm having good fun with it, but I do wish it would stop whisking me away from its lovely maps to go and complete yet another tedious mini-game.

Its latest BIOS update - out now via the MyAsus app – includes a fix that allows the handheld Windows PC to correctly run in its fastest, power-hungriest Turbo mode when connected to sufficiently high-wattage, third-party docking stations and USB-C hubs. In other words, it now works with more of the best Steam Deck docks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has released another trailer for Pokémon Horizons: The Series, and it’s also the first English-dubbed trailer, too. 
This anime is the one replacing the long-running Pokémon anime that recently wrapped up after 25 seasons of pocket monster adventures. Horizons features new protagonists, Liko and Roy, who are joined by Friede, the Professor of this series, alongside Captain Pikachu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Sim Fest is the latest genre-specific event, discounting dozens of games about emerging cities, dad hobbies, tactical warfare, and other stimulating simulations. Heavy hitters such as Disney Dreamlight Valley and the newest Bus Simulator are enjoying nice discounts, but as always, some hidden gems require a little bit of scrolling. The sales last until July 24th, so here are some good old recommendations from the event.


Surprise! Lakeburg Legacies is a hybrid between village management and mediaeval matchmaking , and it’s out now with a 15% sale bringing the price down to £16.50/$19.50. Love is almost as hard-to-manage as the economy, but worry not, a soothing storybook aesthetic should make this one slightly less stressful than couple’s therapy and/or mayoral duties. 


Wobbly person sim Human: Fall Flat has a hefty 70% discount and is currently £4.80/$6.50. To celebrate the puzzle-platformer’s seventh anniversary, the team are also sharing some mysterious news tomorrow. That’s in addition to a new level coming in August, so look forward to more clumsy flailing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember the last time I struggled so much to get through a game.
You misunderstand. I'm not saying ΔV: Rings Of Saturn is a chore or grind. I found it hard because any time I boot it up, I can get lost for hours just playing it. Not trying to win, not following the story, not looking for (ugh) "progression". Just mining, exploring, idly drifting through the void. It is a game I don't want to exhaust because I'm enjoying it too much. I went back in "for a quick dive" twice during this intro.
It doesn't have Content. It's not one of those compulsive, manipulative forever games. You could barge efficiently through it, finding probably all its secrets and items as fast as possible. That wouldn't be wrong, exactly, but it's missing the point: this is a game to be savoured, not consumed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another week means more freebies are available from the Epic Games Store, and this week two very different games have slashed their price tags. Starting today, The Elder Scrolls Online and Murder By Numbers are both free to keep from the digital store. Something for multiplayer dragon slayers and solo picross lovers alike. 

 
The Elder Scrolls Online is, well, The Elder Scrolls but online. The long-running MMO has been unlocking doors into every corner of Tamriel, most recently with the Necrom expansion’s otherworldly tentacles and massive mushrooms. It's good at accommodating solo players who are looking to scratch a Skyrim-sized itch - since the next Elder Scrolls is at least five years away. That approachability got the game into our list of the ten best MMOs on PC. 


On the other end of the humanities versus maths spectrum, we have Murder By Numbers, a murder mystery visual novel where you complete picross puzzles to further the investigation. Plus there's a robo-friend who pulls out a monocle every now and then, which is just plain cute. AliceB said the game was “worth a poke around if you’re a fan of either genre involved,” in our Murder By Numbers review. Even though neither half “are given enough space to breathe,” it should be worth a try for the affordable price of zero pence, though.

While the last showing of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 focused on gameplay, today’s is all about the narrative, and it seems to be teasing who our Venom might be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much has been made about Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon’s mech-based gameplay, but a new trailer shines a light on its narrative. To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. 
Despite the "VI" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or "Raven" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. 


Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC. You can learn more by checking out our recent cover story.]]></summary>

More specifically, Skull Island: Rise of Kong will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime this fall, according to publisher GameMill Entertainment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.
The five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.


The video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. 
Atlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gundam Evolution, the competitive multiplayer title set within the popular Gundam universe, is shutting down.
Despite launching less than a year ago in September 2022, executive producer Kazuya Maruyama shared in a blog post that support for the game will be winding down, though he doesn't provide any specifics as to why.  
“We wanted to create a title that brought FPS fans and Gundam fans together," Maruyama writes. "We challenged ourselves to create an authentic Gundam FPS game that could be played globally. Unfortunately, we have determined that it is no longer possible for us to provide a service that satisfies our players.”
A livestream detailing the sunsetting roadmap will air tomorrow, July 21 at 11 p.m. PT. Gundam Evolution’s services officially end on November 29. Until then, Maruyama states that it will still receive updates. Season 6 arrives on August 23, and the final season hits on October 25. Both seasons will introduce a new unit and maps. 
Today, the following services will be suspended:
Ending sales of EVO Coins
Ending sales of EC Pod Limited
Ending updates to EC Pods, CAP Pods, and Ticket Pods
Gundam Evolution was announced at a PlayStation State of Play in March 2022. The FPS title lets players suit up as their favorite mobile suits to battle in 6v6 matches across various game modes. Unfortunately, it now joins the growing list of multiplayer titles that closed their doors this year, which includes Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, Babylon's Fall, Rumbleverse, Apex Legends Mobile, and Knockout City.]]></summary>

Mortal Kombat creator and director of MK1, Ed Boon, tweeted yesterday what fans can expect at the SDCC panel, “Resetting Mortal Kombat: A New Beginning With Mortal Kombat 1,” tomorrow, and it’s going to be perhaps the most significant drop of new information we’ve received for the game yet. Boon says MK1 voice actors will be there alongside NetherRealm Studios developers to tell the “making of” story of the game. Plus, there will be three new MK1 trailers during the panel, including gameplay and a “surprise.” 
Mortal Kombat fans at San Diego Comic-Con. Wanna see a TON of new #MortalKombat1 stuffs?

July 20, 2023
As for when, the “Resetting Mortal Kombat” SDCC panel begins tomorrow, July  21, at 3:15 p.m. PT and lasts one full hour, ending at 4:15 p.m. PT. If you’re ready for new Mortal Kombat 1 footage, be sure to tune in!
MK1 was announced two months ago with a teaser trailer indicating the wider Mortal Kombat universe has been completely reset (hence the “1” in the title). The following month, in June, NetherRealm released our first look at MK1 gameplay with a trailer that featured new looks at the roster, story details, the reveal of Kameo fighters, and more. 
During Summer Game Fest, we went hands-on with it that same month and had a blast with the Kameo fighters and gory and fun fighting action. You can check out some of that action in our MK1 New Gameplay Today here. 
The latest news NetherRealm released about MK1 was a trailer earlier this month revealing Smoke and Rain in the game’s fighter roster. And tomorrow, we’ll receive more information, including three trailers. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.
Are you tuning in tomorrow to learn more about Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

This news arrives the same day Activision Blizzard released its Fiscal Year 2023 Q2 results, which highlights a murky future for the company’s esports efforts despite an otherwise financially successful quarter for the Overwatch 2 maker. Activision Blizzard’s results show that net bookings grew 50% year-over-year in the second quarter, from $1.64 billion to $2.46 billion, due to a lucrative Diablo IV launch, an increase in revenue from various franchises, mobile growth, and more. But, despite that growth, the company laid off around 50 employees in Blizzard’s esports department, Activision Blizzard esports senior director of global communication Brad Crawford confirmed to Game Informer.

Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. 
Enjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: 


Ubisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. 
In our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. 
For more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. 
The Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.

The Crew, Ubisoft’s racing franchise akin to Microsoft’s Forza series and EA’s Need For Speed, has been around for nearly a decade. And since its inception, it has struggled to make a cultural dent in the racing genre, despite sales greenlighting a sequel and, now, a threequel in The Crew Motorfest. I went into a four-hour, hands-on remote preview of Motorfest, hoping to feel something different about this series. But, like The Crew 2 and The Crew before it, Motorfest feels uninspired, even if still a competent racer.

Pikmin has always held a strange spot in Nintendo’s library of games and franchises. Its creation is credited to Mario and Zelda’s dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, which means Nintendo holds it in high esteem, but it has never quite reached the cultural ubiquity of his other works. And maybe it’s unfair to compare the adorable strategy game about dragging the corpses of defeated foes into your spaceship to the iconic plumber and the Hero of Time, but Pikmin 4 might be the one that moves the series closer to those legacies. It represents a high point for Pikmin, thanks in large part to Oatchi, the helpful dog th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is part of a two-part series, of which this is the second. In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>
