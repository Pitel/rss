Last month, Stardew Valley creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone mentioned how he was finally done adding "major new content" for the next update.
Now, to mark the 8th anniversary of the game, he's finally locked in a release date for Version 1.6. It will be arriving next month on 19th March 2024, but the catch is this date only applies to the PC version.

By the time the PlayStation had passed into antiquity in the aughts, the denizens of Web 2.0 became aware of a Famicom/NES demake of Final Fantasy VII. Since Final Fantasy VII was still fondly remembered and the retro gamer identity was reaching its maturity, this was a fascinating topic of conversation. Just hearing about it took your imagination to interesting places.


It was certainly fascinating to me. I didn’t know enough about the backend of video games to really have an idea for how this was possible; a 3-disc epic on a diminutive cartridge. What radical magic!

The sheer popularity of games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, and Fire Emblem have cemented as much.


Maybe this is my own biases speaking, but hearing "(insert name here) Tactics" immediately brings that image to mind, and it's held true for several variations of tactical spin-offs. After playing the demo for Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware's latest, it is clearly falling in the strategy side of the genre; rather than another Tactics, it's hearkening back to a different branch of the Ogre series: Ogre Battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The elite Valkyries' adventures continue in Honkai Impact 3rd's upcoming chapter, Mars Crisis. This time, we'll see new faces join the team, from the eccentric Senadina to the animalistic Coralie 6626 Planck.


If you have always wanted to go on a heroic deep space escapade, now is the perfect time to begin as Honkai Impact 3rd kicks off Part 2 on February 29. You won't stray too far from our solar system as the team sets out on a quest to Mars. That means HoYoverse longtime players can look forward to all-new missions, locations to explore, and challenges to overcome.


Even those who have yet to play Part 1 and 1.5 won't get too lost in the lore, considering that Part 2 begins a different path. On top of that, every battle will increase the thrill, and you must take advantage of your team's kit to unleash brutal blows to new galactic enemies. 




New combat features head to the HoYoverse RPG with the update, too. The Astral Ring, one of Honaki's new battle mechanics, allows you to collect energy in battle, resulting in more damage rates toward foes. You can also take things to the skies through aerial combat, where you can even land a few gnarly combos. 


However, it won't always be so hectic in the world of Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, thanks to the explorative features throughout Mars. Not only will these travels help you grow as a team, but the sights will be stunning to look at with its next-generation graphics. 


Currently, the game is only available for PC and mobile, with Mac functionality expected to come. If you want an early start, you can sign up for pre-registration to get you all set for launch day. More events will arrive shortly after the release of Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, bringing you rewards both in-game and in real life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you pop in Final Fantasy XV only to hitch your Regalia permanently to Galdin Quay? Did you halt progress in Sea of Stars in an effort to filet every single species known to man? If you're a total fishing freak, there's an open-world action-RPG on the way for you called Sea Fantasy. 


Developed by METASLA, Sea Fantasy is a top-down game with a pixel art aesthetic that promises an "Otherworldly Fishing Open World RPG." It also says you can "save the world by fishing!," which might not sound quite as chill as sitting by the dock of the bay should be. That's because there's a slightly darker twist here, as you aim to fish for the world's marine life — known as SeaAZ — while kicking off a story in which the end of the world is imminent. 


Sea Fantasy currently has a projected release window set for February 2025 on PC and as-yet-unspecified consoles. While most of METASLA's first trailer is all about fishing, you can get a glimpse at the larger story that threatens to unfurl near the end. 




Imagine dragons (if you dare)


Just how "epic" will this tale be? The Steam page doesn't dive too much deeper into what to expect, but did you see those dragons at the end of the trailer? Yep, you just got sucked into a fishing game only to be tricked into going on an adventure! It's a real RPG reversal, or so it seems. What we know so far is that you'll be able to hop on a ship and explore the open world freely, and dive into dungeons in search of treasure. You'll have to avoid traps along the way, of course. Lest you forget, as the devs put it, "this is not a peaceful fishing game." 


On the other hand, you could also just catch a ton of fish and use the crafting system to make new rods and hooks. Maybe you'll be able to ignore all those pesky world-saving pleas for a while like every other RPG adventurer worth their salt. Dragons can wait; the door on my sign clearly says "Gone Fishin'."

However, it wasn’t until its 2019 release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, that the developer’s name became synonymous with “you should play this team’s games.” It’s hard to tell what, exactly, made 13 Sentinels the breakout title for Vanillaware, shipping more than 1 million copies worldwide as of August last year, making it the studio’s best-selling title. The easy answer is probably its beloved story, both in how it plays out and how it’s infused into the game’s real-time strategy mech combat.
Publisher Atlus and Vanillaware released it in 2019, so when the team announced its latest title, Unicorn Overlord, last September, it was easy to conclude that this was the studio’s next big focus. And it is, but curi…]]></summary>

Today, ConcernedApe announced an official 1.6 release date, with this update releasing on March 19 on PC and later on console and mobile.


According to ConcernedApe's initial announcement tweet, the PC release date for Stardew Valley 1.6 is March 19. He also highlights that console and mobile will "follow as soon as possible". In short, while there are no official dates for other platforms, we know the update is coming, and it's coming quickly. 




Stardew Valley 1.6 primarily focuses on changes throughout both the early and end-game, including new festivals, late-game content that covers all skill areas, and various dialogue additions. It'll also include new items, crafting recipes, villager winter outfits, and a new starting farm type, among other improvements to expand on the game's pre-existing features. 


Stardew Valley's last major content update, the 1.5 update, launched over four years ago in 2020 and featured new additions such as Ginger Island, the Beach Farm layout, and remixed Community Center bundles to add variety to your playthrough. Update 1.6 is seemingly similar in size and complexity, potentially adding more than the previous update.


While ConcernedApe's latest post reveals that PC players will receive this update in three weeks on March 19, there's currently no word on when console and mobile players will unlock it. If it follows the same timeline as previous updates, console players will likely receive it shortly after those on PC, with it arriving on mobile sometime after.

The post Stardew Valley 1.6 arrives first for PC in March, with consoles and mobile later appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

But how many of us are aware of the full extent of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII extended universe that Square Enix kickstarted in the mid-aughts, in celebration of its seventh anniversary? 


I sure wasn't for a long while, but now I feel like I'm ready to talk about this wackily ambitious attempt at multiplatform, multi-genre, multi-generational storytelling.




Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier: Thirty years before FF7


Even though The First Soldier takes place long before everything else in the series, it only came out in 2021, seemingly in an attempt to make bank on the battle royale craze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Danish studio Die Gute Fabrik, responsible for indie titles such as the excellently unique indie Mutazione, has announced that the company is halting production of current projects. The studio points to the current "challenging funding and investment scene" in games as the big reason behind the decision.




The studio's statement goes on to say that the company stopped production on February 19, and used its remaining money to help the team with a month of paid time.


The most important part, however, is that the studio isn't giving up on trying to find funding to resume production. They're only issuing this public statement to give a proper signal boost to the team members who are now looking for new jobs. Below the announcement, the studio also shared its hiring sheet.

        <updated>2024-02-26T18:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last week’s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it's hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26. 
Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game's new trailer below.


Like Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.
While it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game's benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In yet another round of bad news for the gaming industry, Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures developer Supermassive Games is about to be hit by a wave of layoffs. 


As reported by Bloomberg, the studio has notified 150 employees that their jobs are potentially being cut in the near future. Supermassive Games is expected to lay off 90 employees, just under a third of its approximately 300 person team. 


The company tweeted out a statement addressing the upcoming changes and the process it's undergoing to decide which positions are being removed. As part of the move, the company said, “We are entering into a period of consultation, which we anticipate will result in the loss of some of our colleagues.” The company said it plans to “focus our efforts on our core strengths and upcoming titles.” 




Supermassive Games is the company behind some spectacular horror games like Until Dawn. The studio released another horror hit, The Quarry, in 2022, the same year that the company was acquired by Nordisk Games, and is currently working on Little Nightmares 3 and a new horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.


Working in the video game industry is never easy, but it feels particularly rough out there right now. In 2023 we saw roughly 9,000 layoffs in the gaming industry. The effects ripple out beyond just game developers, with companies like Twitch also being affected. Unfortunately, 2024 doesn’t seem to be bucking that trend anytime soon. In January alone we saw layoffs and canceled games from developers like Black Forest Games and Eidos Montreal. Supermassive Games is the latest studio to get hit with layoffs, but it seems unlikely to be the last.

My head fizzes with ideas for fiendish combos and deeply illegal hands. I'm delighted by its deserved success, with the makers boasting that it sold enough to become profitable within one hour then sold 250,000 copies in 72 hours. In a recent interview, the developer claims that part of why it's so damn successful is because they've barely played other roguelikelike deckbuilders so it's free to do its own thing outside genre conventions. What's interesting to me in this is how Balatro has built on a game which did influence it, the slot machine-building game Luck Be A Landlord.

We are just a few days away from the release of Nightdive Studios' Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster on 28th February and the tech experts from Digital Foundry have popped up to let us know how the 1995 shooter is looking on Switch.
For the most part, the remaster runs well on every platform. Digital Foundry's John Linneman praises the game's fresh visual style and notes that there is very little to distinguish between console versions as far as visuals stand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FuRyu and Natsume Atari have announced that action RPG Reynatis will be arriving in North America this Fall. It’s set for Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC.


The press release makes a big deal about Reynatis being set in a “painstakingly-recreated streets of Shibuya, Tokyo.” A trailer was released alongside the announcement. It’s one of the most ridiculous videos I think I’ve seen since the new Death Stranding reveal. It shows Shibuya government police wizards that maybe fight drug addicts.




One of the first things the Reynatis trailer puts on screen is, “Only by overcoming our fear of idiosyncrasies can we free our true selves,” which is just the most pretentious way to say very little.


I can dig it. FuRyu, as a developer of alternative games, is a bit all over the place with its output. However, the art design and even the ridiculously over-the-top dialogue and narrative setup all kind of pop. The game shifts from the “painstakingly recreated” Shibuya to more abstract places that, I’m guessing, are dungeons. Combat looks pretty Musou-like, which can be hit-and-miss when it comes to application.


Something to keep your eye on, at least. It does, after all, feature the incredible Yoko Shimomura as a composer.


Reynatis will be coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC. Its release date is currently planned for sometime in Fall 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I wonder whether every genre fantasy RPG or RPG-inflected game is essentially a journey towards the Big City. Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you'll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur's Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It's a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively "provincialises" the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games has revealed the next set for its popular strategy auto battler Teamfight Tactics. Titled Inkborn Fables, the new set brings players to a mystical and ancient world filled with mythological creatures and legendary heroes. Patch 14.6, which begins the new Inkborn Fables set, goes live for PC and mobile on March 20, 2024.




I've had a lot of fun with the current TFT set, Remix Rumble. However, the release date for Inkborn Fables is at right around the four-month mark with Remix Rumble which is the standard lifespan for sets at the moment.


As is usual with new sets, Inkborn Fables will introduce new champions, mechanics, traits, augments, cosmetics, and a new Season Pass. Even though the teaser trailer above is brief and doesn't show any gameplay, there are more than likely some hints about some of the things we can expect in the new set. The beautifully painted scrolls depict mystical beasts as well as some pretty fantastical renditions of certain champions from the Runeterra universe including what I'm pretty sure was Janna and Teemo.


Oh, and you want me to think the Rammus picture on the wall is just there for show? As my spiked shell friend would say: "Okay."


Teamfight Tactics: Inkborn Fables will be released on PC and mobile on March 20, 2024, as a free update

Attempt to tele-portal between realities on the Steam Deck, for instance, and you may find yourself trapped in the Stygian void, naught but a frozen loading screen tip for company and suspended hopelessly for all eternity. Or until you hold down the power button.
This crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn’t yet ready for regular handheld play. That’s nothing developers Inflexion Games won’t tell you themselves – they’re "not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch," after all – but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.

The notion that Microsoft is working on its own AI-based upscaler isn't new as such, but it is a bit of a surprise that it'd get shown off in such relatively short order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though many of us may see Skyrim as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, there's no denying that it's a painfully flawed game. We know this, and that's why modders are always working to make sure Bethesda's aging epic maintains some degree of relevancy.


This mod in particular is pretty simple, but quite effective. As spotted by PC Gamer,  Nexus Mods user wSkeever recently uploaded "Simplicity of Stalking - Automatically Follow NPCs." As the name suggests, this gives you the ability to follow a character in Skyrim without having to do that awkward run/walk by their side in order to keep up.




We've all been there. We all know how irritating it is that an NPC's amble is faster than our walk, but slower than our run. Well, wSkeever's mod fixes that.


Even if they don't want to be followed


As the video above shows, simply targeting a character and activating the "Follow" option will make it so you walk a few paces behind them. Instructions say that, to stop following, simply press "any movement or attack controls."


You'll also need to download a few other mods for your game before you can use this one. Outside that, you're good to go. In fact, not only can the Dragonborn now follow people at a comfortable pace, it also works through loading screens as well.


Of course, while it's likely you'll use the mod mainly for following quest NPCs when they're escorting you somewhere, it can also be used on anyone, as far as I can tell. I'm not saying you should be stalking Skyrim residents. What I am saying is that it literally says the word "stalking" in the mod title.

But most of all, we were sad that a whole swathe of gamers would miss out on the opportunity to play Pocket Card Jockey — a solitaire-based horse riding sim which several of us at Nintendo Life have described (without a hint of irony) as Game Freak's best game.
To be clear, not all of us were in the same boat. We awarded the original a 'Good' 7/10 back in 2016, but what was a stubborn mule for some was a prize pony for others.

If you happen to have an Automower NERA from Husqvarna, know that an update for the firmware is coming soon which will allow you to play classic Doom. Just to clarify, it won't turn your garden into the realms of hell. Rather, you'll be able to control it on the robotic lawnmower's screen.




There's even a pretty badass trailer for it. According to the Husqvarna website, once the update is live, the game will be playable "using the robotic lawnmower’s onboard display and controls." You'll navigate with the control knob, while the STA…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the go-to digital storefront for many PC gamers, Steam has dominated the market for the better part of 20 years. Aside from the fact that it has millions of games in its growing selection, regular sales and events continue to be a mild threat to a lot of people's finances.


With that in mind, the latest Steam event will commence today and, much like the Pirates vs. Ninjas sale that took place in January, this one also pits one foe against another. In this case, the Dinos vs. Robots Fest will have the large, scaly creatures of yesteryear fighting it out against the automatons of the futuristic age.




That is to say, there'll be some games in the event that cater to lovers of either dinosaurs or robots. Obvious, really, when you think about it.


And robot dinosaurs, can't forget about them


The above trailer may whet your appetite. As always, we can never be 100% sure what's going to be in each sale, but the teaser gives clips from some notable games.


For example, we get glimpses of Jurassic World Evolution and LEGO Jurassic World for all you dino lovers. Then there's footage from Detroit: Become Human and Terminator: Resistance if bots and mechanoids are more your thing. 


And to bridge the gap, it looks like Horizon Zero Dawn is going in the fest as well. Because in this crazy world, why can't we have a little bit of both? The Steam sale will go on for the week, ending March 4.

A new report from Nikkei Asia has corroborated previous reports that the 'Switch 2' - the affectionately named successor to the Switch - will release at some point in 2025, with the report stating that the console won't launch until March 2025 "at the earliest".
Nikkei states that the reasoning behind the apparent delay from 2024 is so Nintendo can potentially avoid the stock shortages that plagued the Switch upon its own launch in 2017 and avoid resales. The firm is also reportedly keen to allow developers more time to get their titles in sufficient shape for launch.

Hard to tell with that searingly green water on display, but one thing is certain: with Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree and its confirmed poison swamp launching on June 21st, this summer won't be short on big bog energy.

        <updated>2024-02-26T13:58:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier series creator Yoko Taro reportedly teased a third Nier game during the Nier: Orchestra Concert earlier this month. As reported by Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series' music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu – in attendance – could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event. 
However, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout "the story of the show," SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra. 


"[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue," SanTheSly writes. "The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I'd gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease." 
That sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word "repent" to randomly feature a "3." However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn't the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way – Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it.

        <updated>2024-02-26T13:22:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or "Switch 2" as it's been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from VGC and other outlets like Eurogamer that Nintendo's next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei's latest reporting. 


VGC reports that Nikkei writes, "Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch" to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports, Nikkei also writes that Nintendo's next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen. 
Finally, Nikkei writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console's launch at that time, according to VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it'd follow in the Switch's footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.
It's important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch's successor hasn't even been publicly revealed yet, so there's no telling when to expect it officially. In the meantime, though, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year.

I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble's Age Of Mythology.
I'm not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn't even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn't bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren't for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here's a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.

YouTuber Luke Wild of channel SwitchStars — which focuses primarily on highlighting low-effort, low-quality games to avoid on Switch eShop — has published a video detailing what he believes to be an attack on his channel orchestrated by the publisher Midnight Works.
The Moldovan company is responsible for much of the software Wild has covered in recent years. In the video (see below — please note, it contains swearing), he shows messages he received via Discord tipping him off to a request allegedly sent to Midnight Works staff asking them to submit false reports to YouTube.

As spotted by X user Stealth (thanks, VGC), the tease states "I'm sure we'll be able to tell you about some developments in the Bravely series this year, so please stay tuned (roughly translated via Google)". The post is then accompanied by a special piece of artwork from illustrator Rina Yoshiura.

On Saturday, at least one Cloudflare IP address was added to the Piracy Shield anti-piracy system. According to an expert, that ended up blocking a large number of websites, including a charity, a telecoms company, and several schools. It's the outcome many people predicted but one that could've been easily avoided.

Elsewhere, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has seen a good boost in sales to jump up to number eight, while Warner Bros.

We've given this list a good old spring clean following the February 2024 Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase.

Games, is disappointed in the performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Like a poorly made macaroni picture, it looks like this one isn't going up on the fridge.


Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels spoke on the 4th Quarter 2023 Earnings Webcast regarding Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.



"This year, Suicide Squad, one of our key videogame releases in 2024, has fallen short of our expectations since its release earlier in the quarter, setting our games business up for a tough year-over-year comp in Q1."




Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been on a decline since release with many players, myself included, being unable to play the supervillain looter …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realized a long time ago I was probably never going to be good at poker. It's not that I'm bad at assessing risk; worse, I just don't care. When I used to play casual games in-between classes in school, I'd go all-in on bad hands. I'd swap cards for a flush that probably wouldn't show up. So imagine my surprise when Balatro, a deckbuilding poker roguelite, asked me to lean into those bad habits.


Developed by LocalThunk and published by Playstack, Balatro made a bit of a splash during the recent Steam Next Fest. So when people started talking it up in the full release on February 20, I had a feeling I should put this on what I call my "temperature check" radar: dip a toe in, play a few rounds, and see if the hype is real. So I booted it up, expecting a bit of card-counting fun.

As of today, Little Samson is worth more than two months of rent for my small, one-bedroom apartment in a nowhere town. That’s really depressing because it both illustrates how ridiculous the collectors market is for video games and how ridiculously expensive it is just to afford a roof over my head for a fraction of a year.


But I don’t collect games to pretend I have some sort of valuable asset. I collect them to play and appreciate. And to demonstrate this, I put Little Samson in my NES. Then I kind of wiggled it around a bit to get it to display prop…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a series coming up on three decades of history, I guess it only makes sense it expands into mobile with everything else. During today's Age of Empires New Year, New Age Livestream, Microsoft unveiled Age of Empires Mobile which is coming to both iOS and Android




Developed by TiMi Studios, Age of Empires Mobile brings the classic RTS genre to mobile devices for the first time ever. Featuring several different civilizations including China, Rome, France, and Byzantine, players will be able to choose from over 40 heroes to raise an army and conquer others.


Visually Age of Empires Mobile actually looks pretty good. I know mobile graphics have come a long way, but I sort of expected it to just look like Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition but it actually looks better.


Unfortunately, I'm not completely sold on the gameplay. Even though several scenes showed what looked to be pretty similar to authentically classic Age of Empires gameplay that we've come to love over the many years, other scenes showed what looked to be pretty normal markers of current mobile "Pay to Win" trends like a VIP Level, timers (that can be skipped for a cost, I'm sure), and more. Hopefully, I'm just being paranoid. But it worries me to see predatory practices like that in an epic franchise like Age of Empires.


Age of Empires Mobile is currently available for pre-registering on both iOS and Android,

I've had enough of this dream... The night blocks all sight...


While speaking with Eurogamer during the aforementioned Elden Ring DLC announcement, the topic of a potential Bloodborne remake sprang up. Miyazaki seems to have waxed nostalgic. 


"It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans," Miyazaki told Eurogamer. "It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mother games are a highly celebrated RPG series, containing the likes of both Mother and EarthBound. There's also Mother 3, a really good RPG from what I've heard, that still hasn't made it to the west. 


Ever since it came out in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance, fans have been begging Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi for an official English release. We've recently learned that Mother 3 will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online, but still only in Japan. Western fans naturally clamored for a Western release, which got him to make a tweet asking fans to ask Nintendo, not him.




By looking at the Tweet above alone, it's hard to infer whether he's just politely saying that there's nothing he can do about it, or if he really wants us to beg louder for Nintendo to get Mother 3 to spread all over the world. 


Either way, Twitter user Lone translated a letter by Itoi that seems to vent his innermost thoughts and feelings about the game, and it sure does look like the man would be really happy if we got to play Mother 3.




Freeing Mother 3 from its GBA-shaped prison and putting it on the Switch is great. This rocks not just for the instant gratification of Japanese fans, but also for gaming preservation purposes — even if it's only coming out digitally. Still, it's a total bummer that there's no news of a possible English port.


In any case, fans have infamously, notoriously found ways to still play lauded games that never came over to the West. And maybe, right now, that's still the best solution for someone just dying to play them. Or, if you just don't want to wait on a western release of Mother 3, then perhaps it's time to finally learn Japanese.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Game Studios is currently hosting a New Year, New Age live stream to celebrate everything Age of Empires and reveal updates about its future. However, it's not all about Age of Empires. After being teased in 2022, Age of Mythology: Retold has been revealed. A definitive edition of the original classic RTS Age of Mythology, Retold will release on PC and Xbox Serise X|S later this year.




A bit more mystical


If you've never played the original Age of Mythology but are a fan of RTS like Age of Empires, you are in for quite a treat. Mythology takes the foundation of Age of Empires but adds a mystical twist to it, allowing players to call upon various gods to help them in combat. Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons are all options in Age of Mythology. 


As great as Age of Empires is, there has always been something special to me about Age of Mythology. Being able to summon Nidhogg or call in a massive thunderstorm not only felt fun but felt like it added a unique element to the RTS genre.


Age of Mythology: Retold is primarily a graphical upgrade to the original, mixing its classic gameplay elements with modernized visuals. It will include the 50-mission campaign as well as an all-new Arena of the Gods feature that allows you to complete all new trials either solo or co-op with friends as you take on challenges as the gods themselves battle it out.


While no specific release date was given, Microsoft Game Studios did indicate Age of Mythology: Retold will be released later this year on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and be available Day One on Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

This new look at the game's action features conversation from game producer and director Fumihiko Yasuda and animation lead Kosuke Wakamatsu discussing how Team Ninja approached the combat. They say it started with determining the different ideologies within Rōnin history, why certain individuals fought the way they did, and how that translates to a game aiming to be authentic to the Bakumatsu history.

"AAAA" is the sound that escapes my lips as I embark on yet another hour-long sail to retrieve some logs, or when I'm doing my little deliveries and a brigantine starts on me. After 11 years in development, Ubisoft's pirate game isn't necessarily a disaster, I just think its live service model has transformed piracy from a roguish lark on the waves into a tremendously dull series of shipping tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can't get enough Death Stranding? Well, you're in luck. The documentary film Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds shows the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio Kojima Productions and the development of Death Stranding. Connecting Worlds is available to stream now on Disney+, Hulu, and Hotstar depending on region. 




If you are in the United States, Connecting Worlds is available to stream on Hulu. For most of the world, however, it can be streamed on Disney+. In South Africa and the Philippines, you will need Hotstar to stream the documentary. Here are all the regions in which you can watch Death Stranding: Connecting Worlds:



Disney+: Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Balkans EU (Bulgaria, Croatia, Solvenia), Non-EU (Albania, Boasnia/Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia, Serbia), UK, Ireland, Gibraltar


Hulu: United States


Hotstar: South Africa, Philippines



At the time of this post, the documentary has a 8.3/10 rating on IMDB with a featured review calling the documentary "Very much a Kojima tribute piece". Did we really expect anything different?


According to the promotional images for Connecting Worlds, the one-hour-long documentary features "A visionary journey into the creation of Death Stranding."


I've always been a fan of behind-the-scenes-style game-dev documentaries. It's always fun to see the truly creative process of game development first-hand.  Based on the trailer it looks like a bit of Kojima praising mixed with some actual behind-the-scenes, so maybe I'll give it a whirl.


Think Geoff Keighley will make an appearance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A solo developer from Moldova, Andrground, has announced their upcoming project, Troleu, a totally accurate work simulator about working as a trolleybus conductor.


Okay, I’m lying. While you do work as a trolleybus conductor, and your job is mostly to issue tickets and collect fare, you also spend much of your time engaging in mortal combat with rule breakers. To my knowledge, this isn’t something that conductors regularly do, but maybe things are different in Moldova.




Both the art style and the general concept of Troleu remind me of Night of the Consumers. Maybe that is the main influence, but the change of vocation completely alters the focus of the game. A big focus of its trailer is on kicking Soviets and misogynists screaming out the door.


The concept sounds like it will only support a short experience – which might be true, as that tends to be what the developer is known for – but the press release suggests that you’ll be visiting a number of locales. It says, “From bustling city streets to tranquil suburbs, every route presents its own set of challenges and surprises.”


Andrground is well known for their short horror work, Elevated Dread, which is, coincidentally, the state of mind I perpetually exist in.


Troleu doesn’t really have a release date, so you’ll have to survive by watching the trailer repeatedly, as I have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I gathered you all here to tell you that water is wet. In other – perhaps equally obvious – news, Palworld continues to attract more players than some countries have citizens. As of this week, more than 25 million people have played Pocketpair's monster-catching survival game.


That's according to developer Pocketpair, who posted about the milestone achievement on Twitter/X recently. A simple breakdown of the figures suggests that 15 million of these players are from Steam, while the remaining 10 million are Xbox users. While folks on Steam have to buy a copy to join in, Palworld's Xbox figures include some combination of players hopping in via Game Pass or buying the game through the Xbox storefront. 




To put that into some perspective, Bethesda boasted that 13 million players …]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-02-23T17:10:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.
It's also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you're off the clock, it's time to pick up the game's wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.

The MW3 level reset issue is being addressed





According to CODUpdates on Twitter, the level reset issue in Modern Warfare 3 "appeared overnight." As such, it doesn't seem like the cause is known just yet. However, the developers are already hard at work looking to address the problem and fix it as soon as possible. In short, please don't panic about your level, it will likely be back to normal within a reasonable amount of time (hopefully).

When I first saw the name C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield appear on the Next Fest landing page, I instantly thought, 'Yes, here we go, now we're talking'. 
Well, my first thought was actually, 'Gee, if only there was an easy way to know what this game's about based on just the title alone,' but that's just me being facetious. Ultimately, I have a lot of respect for this kind of naming convention, and the fact it's also being made by the Octopath Traveler developers Acquire is really just the icing on the cake.

As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. Titled Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film "explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding."
It was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus.

February 23, 2024
We haven't yet watched it but given Kojima's love of movies, we're excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release of Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development. 
For more, read Game Informer's Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director's Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird.

It's a pretty stacked line-up as these things go, but it's Arranger's world of constantly shifting sliding tiles that's really piqued my curiosity.

The UI is cleaner and tighter, and I’ve had more space to explore (and enjoy) the mysterious nooks of its magic 'n' moustaches world. There’s potential here, but it’s very much the raw kind, especially when performance needs as much work as it does.
Besides relying on upscalers like DLSS for truly smooth running, Nightingale currently has a serious stuttering problem, and bumping into an ugly graphical artefact or even a hard crash is worryingly common. I’ve pulled together an optimised settings guide (down below) so that you don’t need to drop the visual quality lower than is strictly necessary, but do keep in mind that this is early access with emphasis on the early.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix's latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it's the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). 
Currently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.
There’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.

February 22, 2024
As you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it's important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. 
Still, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service multiplayer shooter from Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, launched earlier this month. It received middling reviews – read Game Informer's review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 – and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had "fallen short of our expectations," as reported by IGN. 


More specifically, that's Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady's latest effort fell short of the company's expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League's missed expectations set Warner Bros.' games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.
Wiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company's massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's review of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and then check out Game Informer's list of the best superhero games of all time. After that, read our list of upcoming superhero games to look forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Penny's Big Breakaway, the momentum-based 3D platformer from developer Evening Star, surprise launched earlier this week after appearing in a Partner Showcase Nintendo Direct. During a livestream held by Evening Star on the game's February 21 launch, one designer completed the first level with a single, two-minute combo, and it's a feat to behold. 
If you haven't yet checked out Penny's Big Breakaway, it's a 3D platformer modeled off the strange and weird platformers of the PlayStation 1 generation, rather than Nintendo's popular platforming efforts. As such, the game features a unique moveset that feels similar to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, with a Devil May Cry combo meter to boot. 
Check out the Evening Star developer reach a massive 191-move combo in the first stage of Vanillatown, the first world in Penny's Big Breakaway, below: 
Vanillatown 1-1 100% in just 1 combo!?

February 22, 2024
As you can see, this designer – Milena – completes the first level with one continuous combo. We're not sure we're quite up to the task but we wouldn't be surprised if fans of the game spend time outcomboing this score. Only time will tell. 
Penny's Big Breakaway is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

The gaslamp fantasy survival game requires you be online even if you want to play by yourself, which dovetailed poorly with server issues at launch to frustrate folks. Inflexion say that early in development they needed to make a choice between focusing on co-op or offline first, and now think they made the wrong call. They plan to remedy this, but it's not yet clear when they'll actually add an offline mode.

Rather, Elden Ring is an "open world" game in the same way that Dark Souls is a "hard" game, Miyazaki feels. Confused? Well, this is the godfather of the notoriously unforthcoming Souls series we're talking about. I've never interviewed the guy, but I suspect he composes his responses using the game's soapstone messaging system.

This Intel Optane 905P drive is the biggest they ever made at 1.5TB, and now it's reduced to $380 when you use code SYADP2Z384 at Newegg. 
For systems that accept PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 5.0 drives, I'd recommend sticking with our usual gaming SSD recommendations, but for PCIe 3.0 systems this is a fascinating option that emphasises random performance against sequential speeds. I recorded some of the very fastest game load times with this drive when I tested it against other PCIe 3.0 options, and its random write speeds are competitive even with later generation PCIe 4.0 alternatives.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/22/little-devil-inside-reemerges-with-a-new-trailer-and-cryptic-developer-update"/>
        <updated>2024-02-22T23:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.
As reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,
The rest of Neostream's update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.


Little Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console's launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You'll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. 
Little Devil Inside has no release window but we're hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It's a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.
The original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I'm pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there's good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every few years, gorgeous action adventure Little Devil Inside re-surfaces with another stunning, exciting trailer. We last saw it at a PlayStation State Of Play back in 2021, where it was seemingly on track for a 2022 release.

It's been radio silence ever since, but it has now once again resurfaced, with another gorgeous trailer and a promise that the development team, now smaller, is back "with the duty and conscience to fulfill what we set out to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation VR2 launched in February of last year and while its debut featured new first-party titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, our favorites on the new platform featured previously released titles like Resident Evil Village. Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. 
"[We're] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5," a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. "We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates."


The rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year. 
For more about the hardware, read Game Informer's PS VR2 review, and then read Game Informer's Horizon Call of the Mountain review. After that, read about why Resident Evil Village is the PS VR2's best exclusive, and then check out these 10 games to play using your VR headset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games has rechristened Project L, its upcoming League of Legends fighting game, to its official name of 2XKO. While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.


The 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. 
2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game's official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Helldivers 2 continues to be struggling with its own success, suffering wildly overloaded servers that make it sometimes tricky to even log in, a new patch today has added a feature to help alleviate the pressure. Having previously capped the number of players to 450,000, developers Arrowhead have now added an auto-kick to stop people hogging those precious slots while not playing. After 15 minutes, AFK players will now get booted. It's clearly not the big fix needed but hopefully fresh duct tape will help hold the co-op shooter together until more permanent solutions arrive.

Thankfully, the Flintlock train does seem to be kicking into a gear a bit more now that it's steaming toward its Summer 2024 release window, as yesterday developers A44 Games released a new gameplay teaser trailer for it, ahead of a wider reveal planned for next month. The trailer shows more of its melee and magical combat, though personally, I'm just glad to see that heroine Nor hasn't been neglecting her leg days, as we get to see some meaty and powerful kicks in there, too. Love a big kick, me.

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…]]></summary>

Four years since he last appeared, a target played by famous dier Sean Bean will return in March. Kill him, kill him while you can. It's what he would want. It's how he pays his rent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 reset the fighting universe when it launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC last September. Now, it's time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena's Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021's The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. 
Ahead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker's gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. 
Check out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character's live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. 
Peacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. 
Elsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she's an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review.

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has quite the act to follow up – it must both live up to the sky-high expectations set by its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and synthesize and modernize perhaps the most crucial chapter in our heroes' adventure across Gaia. While my 80 hours in Rebirth didn't quite match the overall nirvana of Remake, it's a game I struggled to put down. A few stumbling blocks, like a bloated and sometimes tedious open world and intermittently uneven pacing, threaten the highs of Rebirth. But an exciting and well-told story, with an a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a little masochistic streak in me that croons with joy whenever I reach the moment of impending doom in turn-based strategy games. You know the moment I mean. The one where the world fills with enemies patiently bobbing and snarling while you try to conjure up an impossibly perfect set of moves that'll keep things going for one more turn? Cobalt Core is great at this. I've only played a couple of runs so far, but boy, you'd better believe I know when the end is drawing near. It's hard to miss, because the entire screen fills up with rows of damage numbers beaming down onto your hapless little spaceship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shin Megami Tensei 5 is getting the Persona 5 Royal treatment, with an all-new Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance edition that's out in June. It features a new story path, an improved battle system, new areas, and more, as you'd expect from Atlus' history of definitive editions. What's more, while SMT 5 was a Switch exclusive when it came out in 2021, the new Vengeance edition will be heading to PC and other consoles, too. Do I have time for another enormous JRPG? Probably not, but I'll admit that it's got me very interested indeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long time coming, but the first trailer for Borderlands has finally arrived after the first images of the movie emerged this week. First announced in 2015, the live-action film brings Gearbox’s popular co-op loot shooter to life with some big-name stars, bigger explosions, and (hopefully) even bigger laughs. 


Directed by Eli Roth, the film stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Ariana Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis). Like the games, the film follows our group of Vault Hunters as they search for a valuable relic on the desert planet of Pandora. They also stumble upon a missing girl with a powerful secret that could endanger the universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Thieves is the last Xbox first-party game officially confirmed for a new platform. Rare’s shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.
Sea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. 


As associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.]]></summary>

Like a ship that has changed tack countless times and delayed its arrival at port, Skull and Bones has launched far later than expected and faced trouble along the way. Even so, this pirate adventure surprised me with the breadth of its world, the richness of its commerce simulation, and an approachable and rewarding naval combat system. As a living game built around seasonal content and a growing universe, it has a ways to go to be at its best, but the bones of a quality experience are here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, many were surprised the heavily rumored Hi-Fi Rush was absent. However, shortly after that presentation, which confirmed Pentiment and Grounded are both arriving on Switch, we learned that the next of the four previous Xbox exclusives Phil Spencer said last week are coming to additional platforms. Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.
Hi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.
Hi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer's 2023 "Best Microsoft Exclusive" award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it's less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there's a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it's in 1.0. If you haven't yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it's very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.

We'll also try and stuff as many of your thoughts and observations into the liveblog discussion proper, too, to try and make it feel as communal as possible (and not just us waffling on about it for a full hour).  
So, folks, tell us what you think about the excellent Cobalt Core below. What you like, dislike, your favourite moments (or your most hated moments)... Anything goes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, we learned Grounded is coming to Switch this April, but that's not the only Obsidian-developed title fans can expect. Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.
Pentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. 
When it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer's Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is "a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games."
Pentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox's Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future. The other two are reportedly Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush, but neither was featured on today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long wait, we finally have details about Elden Ring's upcoming DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree. Publisher Bandai Namco and developer From Software released the add-on's first official trailer this morning which revealed it is launching June 21. Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.
You can check out the trailer below.


The trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella's egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear's head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.

The game's official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game. Here's the official description.
The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.
Discover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.

Grounded originally launched on Xbox One and PC in Early Access in June 2020, where it stayed until September 2022. This is in line with Spencer's comments that the Xbox games coming to other platforms will have been exclusive on Xbox for at least a year. The other rumored Xbox titles to come to other platforms are Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush, Rare's Sea of Thieves, and another Obsidian game, Pentiment. 
Grounded arrives on Switch on April 16 with cross-platform co-op, but you can also take on the miniaturized backyard challenges solo. For more on Grounded, check out our coverage hub right here.]]></summary>

The game is apparently a "faithful" port of the game as the trailer didn't highlight much in terms of new content or upgrades. But the game does look undeniably sharper.
If you're unfamilair, Epic Mickey for Wii was a Wii game where a classic, mischievous Mickey finds a magic brush that lets him manipulate the world. Its legacy, however, is it marked the return of Walt Disney's original creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit's return to Disney canon.
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed arrives this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kemuri was first revealed at The Game Awards last December, a co-op parkour action game where you fight yokai and look cool from the creative and art director for Ghostwire: Tokyo, Ikumi Nakamura. The team at Unseen have done a seven minute video where talk a little bit about the content and vibes of the game, basically by just listing cool stuff. Think of something cool, and it's probably in Kemuri somehow. The video both excited and frustrated me, as it seems like an exciting game, but I very much feel the video does not answer the question posed by its own title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before founding Inflexion in 2021, Aaryn Flynn worked at BioWare. He's got credits on some of the studio's best-loved games, from Baldur's Gate 2 through Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic to Dragon Age: Origins and the Mass Effect trilogy. He was BioWare's general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it's certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days. Speaking to me ahead of Nightingale's launch, Flynn talked about the difficulty of making headway as a new developer in an industry where the most successful competing live service titles have effectively become part of the landscape - indeed, a force of "gravity".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night I tried to host a Helldivers 2 co-op mission and the "ready up" button froze up. I spammed it in a panic while the randos in my voice channel fumed at the delay. Then I popped us out of the drop pods, attempted to quit the game in embarrassment, and the PC promptly crashed. Another blow for managed democracy! 


I'm hoping that the ready up problem is one of the "various UI issues [that] may appear when the game interacts with servers" which Arrowhead are addressing in a future Helldivers 2 patch. Before that, there's patch 1.000.10, which fixes PC quickplay match-making bugs, gets rid of a crash issue when displaying mission rewards, and tunes civilian extraction mission difficulty, amongst other things. It's live now, and the full changelog is below.

As things stand, hundreds of domains are completely devoid of DNS, resulting in one of the biggest mass blackouts in recent history.

        <updated>2024-02-20T21:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.
We’ll let the trailer speak for itself.


In Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.
Since the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  
Redemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. 
Redemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we'll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've reached a point as a society where it feels like it's only a matter of time before your favorite celebrity gets added to Fortnite. When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says "Fortnite Festival," implying the crossover might be linked to the game's musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.
The funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, "what is fortnight," either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she's corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Abstraction Games aims to resurrect Gigantic, the 5v5 MOBA-hero-shooter hybrid that went offline in 2018 – only a year after its full release. I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.
Watch The Gigantic: Rampage Edition Announcement Trailer:


Notably, Game Informer's original Gigantic review wasn't as positive as I personally felt about the game. Did you play the original version? If so, what was your opinion? Do you think Gearbox can successfully find an audience this time around?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're in a bit of a live-action video game adaptation golden age right now. Not every project is a hit, but there have been enough success stories that learning about a new film or TV show in the works doesn't instantly fill fans with dread. The latest example of that growing trend is the live-action Borderlands movie, which we just got our first official looks at, thanks to People.
This image shows the main line-up of the movie. Going clockwise, starting from the top left, Ariana Greenblatt is Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu is Krieg, Jamie Lee Curtis is Tannis, Jack Black is the voice of Claptrap, Kevin Hart is Roland, and Cate Blanchett takes the lead role as Lilith. You can see a head-on image of her character below.
This film has been in the works for a while now, but outside of these images, there's not much new information. If you haven't seen it yet (or just need a refresher, since it's been over two years), here's the official synopsis from a 2021 press release:
IGN also shared the movie's first official poster.
Here's the exclusive new poster for the @BorderlandsFilm!

Borderlands, directed by actor/director Eli Roth, hits theaters August 9.

Around half the celestial sphere is given over to the dominions of the Automatons and Terminids, leaving ample room for another enemy faction to be inserted via free update or paid DLC. What could that next faction be? Surely it can't be any worse than a horde of giant bugs or a legion of robots. Surely it can't be, say, a highly advanced elder species of teleporting illusionists equipped with lightning guns and cloaking devices. Oh dear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale releases into Steam early access today. Our pre-launch impressions? Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We're also pretty keen as a team on the game's Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. 


Speaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion's CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is "cautious" about committing to a full-blown roadmap.

The Pokémon Company has announced that the annual showcase for the franchise will return next week on February 27. As for what to expect, no details were shared but if it's like previous Pokémon Day celebration showcases, it could be an exciting day for trainers. 
This news was revealed today on the official Pokémon X (formerly Twitter) account with a quick video showing a 3D Pikachu rushing onto the screen to pose in front of the Pokémon Presents logo while a retro rendition of a classic song plays. Now, instincts might tell you to read into this model and song but experience learned from previous announcements says it's not a tease – The Pokémon Company always does this kind of stuff and there's almost no…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year, there are a couple of game soundtracks I become properly obsessed with. In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  
Composed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.

Enough is changed that developers Owlcat are giving everyone in your party a free respec to adjust to what the game has become.

Out today for PC at 12pm UTC, 1pm GMT, 7am ET and 4am PT, the 1.07 patch adds Full Synchronization Challenge, a permadeath mode (originally teased last year) that not only permakills you when you're slain by enemies, but also deletes your save file when you commit crimes such as slaughtering civilians, or going outside of "authorised map locations".

I know enough to make "[x] for the [x] throne!" jokes, basically. My experience with cleaning-stuff-sim PowerWash Simulator is extensive, though, and I was excited when the crossover with Warhammer 40K was teased a while back. Last night we got a full trailer and release date of Frebruary 27th - next week! - and I'm now earnestly very excited. The trailer is both very funny and shows off massive things to clean. Win win, innit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo will air a Partner Showcase of its Direct videos this week on Wednesday, February 21. Unlike a traditional Direct, Partner Showcases are presentations that highlight upcoming third-party games for Switch.
The Direct will air at 6 a.m. Pacific/9 a.m. Eastern on YouTube and will run for 25 minutes. Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”
Ignoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:
Inkulinati
Unicorn Overlord
Gylt
Highwater
South Park: Snow Day!
Open Roads
Botany Manor
Tales of Kenzera: Zau
SaGa Emerald Beyond
Braid: Anniversary Collection
Numerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.
Or we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. 
Of course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out. What do you hope to see in the Partner Direct? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

An Android version is also planned, but its release is currently unknown. You can, however, pre-register for that version on Warframe’s website.

Nearly 10 years on from 2015's Helldivers, Helldivers 2 carefully adapts the simple yet exciting formula of bug-blasting with buddies for a modern audience. Arrowhead Game Studios has swapped the top-down perspective for third-person while maintaining the frenetic, ballistic loop of crash-landing on hostile planets, completing difficult missions, and extracting against all odds.
In a galaxy torn apart by war, you and your friends are Helldivers, the brainwashed protectors of Super Earth, invigorated by humorous trite …]]></summary>

The question has been asked in the past, but it was most recently brought up at a panel at FanExpo Vancouver 2024, according to The Direct.
The question was posed to Cameron Monaghan, known for his roles on Gotham and Shameless as well as his starring role as Cal Kestis in the Star Wars Jedi series. For Monaghan, it's not a question of whether he's willing to reprise his role as the character, but a question of the circumstances in which that character would appear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it's cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro's whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you're dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you've won a run of Balatro.
The boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand's chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I've yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it's been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn't simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It's about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn't just encouraged in Balatro. It's damn near mandatory, and it's all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.

Even ongoing server connectivity issues haven’t done much to spoil the sense of fun, which incidentally, can also be shared on the Steam Deck.
Indeed, following a quick Proton update on Valve’s part, its previously SteamOS-incompatible anti-cheat will no longer put the kibosh on you dropping into Helldivers 2 via your Deck. I’ve been testing on both an original 512GB model and the newer Steam Deck OLED, and as long as you don’t mind dropping the quality settings, it can usually run tidily above 30fps.

Well, another joins the fray in Enotria: The Last Song, an Italian-inspired Soulslike with the loveliest setting I've seen in a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BitTorrent is often characterized as a decentralized file-sharing technology. However, its reliance on centralized indexes runs contrary to this idea. Over the years, several 'indestructible' alternatives have been proposed, including the relatively new Bitmagnet software. With Bitmagnet, people can run their own private BitTorrent index, relying on DHT and the BEP51 protocol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones is finally out today. Let's play the opening hour and see if it is worth wait. Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it. Our full review isn't ready quite yet, but you can  read Matt Miller's positive early impressions so far by heading here. You can also check out an hour of gameplay below.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
