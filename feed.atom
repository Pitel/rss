While the community is eager to take any new goodies, issues crop up when there's such a glut of guns in the game that it's impossible to find anything specific. To that end, Bungie is preparing to reduce the number of available world drop weapons alongside the reintroduction of weapon foundry focusing.


Bungie is essentially using this as an opportunity to massively offload the game's world loot pool. A grand total of 24 weapons will move into the upcoming foundry focusing system. Additionally, eight extra guns are being thrown into Xûr's loot pool for good measure (and added variety). Basically, the vast majority of the game's core weaponry should be way easier to get as of Season 23, as players w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced! 
Part 2 - Bringing The Smoke

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At long last, AMD's response to Nvidia's ubiquitous DLSS 3.0 frame generation tech has made its debut. Despite the lack of pomp about the long-awaited feature, AMD has pushed FSR3 out into two relatively major games: Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum. The particularly notable bit here is that Forspoken's demo now supports FSR3 as well. This is great news for those who'd like to try frame generation out but aren't keen on buying Forspoken.


More specifically, FSR3 frame generation tech will be available in Forspoken as of update 1.22. For Immortals of Aveum, the feature is live as of version 1.0.5.0, which could have big implications for its performance. Since AMD hadn't previously announced when, exactly, FSR3 would become publicly available for anyone to use, all benchmarks and comparison…]]></summary>

A lot of this stuff you may already know thanks to recent FFXIV Live Letters, but Growing Light has some of us a little more antsy than usual.

Before I get started, the me get this out of the way: the Switch is definitely my most-played console of the year. Between The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Fire Emblem Engage and Pikmin 4 (the less said about Vampire Survivors, the better), the hundreds of hours that I have poured into Nintendo's hybrid hardware far outweighs my time on any other console over the past nine months. But when it comes to my most-played game, it's a different story.
You see, despite all of these wonderful offerings from Nintendo this year, the game I have come back to every single day is not on the Switch, but rather on my phone. Just in case the above video hasn't spoilt it already, I am, of course, talking about Marvel Snap, the digital collectable card game from Second Dinner Studios and Nuverse. The title is weeks away from its one-year anniversary on 18th October and, following a successful launch of the PC version last month, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that a Switch port is on the cards. Surely?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your one-stop shop for all things Splatoon.
Nintendo has today revealed that its online base for all things Splatoon — creatively called 'Splatoon Base' — is now available to read in English. What's more, you can also check out the all-new 'History: The Splatoon Journey' page to see an interactive timeline of the series from its announcement in 2014 through to the present day.
It's strange to think that Splatoon (which we still consider to be a relatively new franchise for Nintendo) is approaching 10 years since its release — hey, time flies when you're shooting squids. Checking out the new Splatoon Base timeline, you can see just how far it has come, including being used in the Switch reveal trailer, to getting the Inklings in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.
Yet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. 
Regardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. 
I was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No safe haven here.
As anyone who plays board games (or with friends who like board games) can attest, an involved, TTRPG-style board game can be cumbersome. From in-depth rules and systems, it takes a while to get into Gloomhaven and introducing new players to its dense combat can make multiplayer challenging. But also like a dense board game, Gloomhaven rewards you when you put in the work to learn its rules and systems. Its deep card-based tactics gameplay shines in its many modes.
Gloomhaven blends hexagonal, grid-based tactical gameplay with a truly unique card-based battling system that's deeply challenging, but also very rewarding once you manage to get a hold of all its moving parts. Its in-depth tutorial is largely okay at teaching you what you need to know, though not very quickly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective Pikachu Returns, the sequel to the 2016 Nintendo 3DS game, launches on October 6. It's a spin-off Pokemon title featuring a mystery-solving Pikachu and his friend Tim Goodman who lives in Ryme City. This time around, the pair seeks to get to the bottom of a jewel theft, and judging by trailers, they're in for a big adventure. 


With the release date just around the corner, Nintendo is celebrating by offering Detective Pikachu Returns icon elements. These can then be used to create custom user icons. The icon elements will come in waves, and first wave started yesterday and will run until October 5 at 5:59 PM PT. You can expect the next waves at the following times: 



Wave 2: October 5 at 6:00 PM PT - October 12 at 5:59 PM PT


Wave 3: October 12 at 6:00 PM PT - October 19 at 5:59 PM PT


Wave 4: October 19 at 6:00 PM PT - October 26 at 5:59 PM PT





You'll find the rewards by turning on your Switch and heading to the Nintendo Switch Online icon. At this point, it's worth mentioning that you have to be subscribed to the service to redeem the rewards. Scroll to the "Missions & Rewards" tab and you'll find the various icon elements there. 


You won't have to pay for these icon elements, but they aren't free either. Images cost 10 Platinum Points, while backgrounds and frames cost 5 Platinum Points. You earn Platinum Points by completing My Nintendo missions, which you can find here.


A spin-off with gameplay that deviates from mainline Pokemon titles may be what the franchise needs right now, as the latest DLC for Scarlet and Violet has failed to leave much of an impression on critics.

There is a lot of retro goodness to be found in looking back on classic Nintendo coverage, and the above 1980s behind-the-scenes peek at Nintendo's Famicom development has it all.
Recently featured in a report by the Yomiuro Telecasting Corporation News Channel, this classic coverage has it all: a look at the development of the original Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, holding a phone receiver up to a speaker to share music samples, a young Miyamoto. If you pay close attention, you can even catch a glimpse of some cut Mario sprites — as noted on Twitter by @Area51_zek:

After having fun in Fae Farm recently, this week I've been taking Moonstone Island for a spin. The twist for this Stardewlike is that it has collided the farming and having a nice house business with Pokémon-style death battles involving whimsical Ghibli-esque Spirits. After a few scant hours I think I sort of... like it...? But I also have some problems with it.

Here's what Sony told Kotaku:

We've spent the last month writing a bunch of articles about Tendershoot's weird and wonderful alternate-reality internet simulator, mourning a time when the internet used to be fun, reminiscing about virtual pets and even having a chat with the Hypnospace creator Jay Tholen about the game's origins and legacy.

The first 'Pokémon X Hatsune Miku' crossover song has been released on YouTube in its entirety, and if you're a fan of either IP, then you'll probably want to check it out.
The song is the first in a wider collaboration between the pair known as 'Project Voltage', which will eventually consist of a total of 18 tracks from different artists. This one, titled 'Volt Tackle', is from music producer DECO*27.

This review, penned by Philip J Reed — our much-missed friend and Nintendo Life contributor — was originally published in January 2012. We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GBA library.

We have to hand this much to Kirby & The Amazing Mirror: it certainly isn't afraid of trying new things. We might not be totally convinced of the necessity of those things, of course, but it's always nice to see a series attempt to expand its boundaries somewhat.

The new perk system means that you can easily create a brutal killing machine, one capable of deflecting bullets with samurai swords and air-dashing like an anime hero to punch enemies apart.
Phantom Liberty, the expansion released right after update 2.0, makes its combat better in one extra way: by making most of it optional.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh god, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to fix it. Oh, hello everybody! Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. 


I've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: "Totally Fucked".

The last few games in the series absolutely rock even from a serious competition standpoint, but I still love the series' absolutely absurd displays of violence. Here are my favorite fatalities in Mortal Kombat history.




7. Smoke bomb


Though easily the least graphic one of the bunch, Smoke's explosive fatality is the most deadly in MK history. Smoke doesn't just smoke his opponent, he smokes himself and even the whole planet. Flawless plan and a flawless victory indeed.


The original hardware MK3 ran on just wasn't powerful enough to make this fatality look as cool as it should have, so I love finally getting to witness it in the glory it deserves in M…]]></summary>

Following a recent Mortal Kombat 1 datamine suggesting the possibility of Ghostface from the Scream series being added to the game in the future, the game's director and co-creator Ed Boon has now posted a rather interesting image on his social media.
It shows an image of horror characters added to past Mortal Kombat games along with a number of others that are yet to cameo in the brutal and bloody fighting series. As you can see below, one of these happens to be Ghostface. This character is featured alongside Chucky and Jigsaw.

And it did, but this time for the studio's other prominent RPG franchise. Today Bethesda apparently shadow-dropped The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a follow-up to Fallout Shelter, out now on Android.


9/29/2023 Update: As of now, anyone attempting to get into this game have begun seeing a message stating "Early Access is full." It appears new players may be locked out for the time being, which was not the case when this story was posted. We'll continue to post updates as we learn more. The original story follows.

        <updated>2023-09-28T23:38:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like cheating doesn’t pay, and Valve is out to prove it in Counter-Strike 2. In its first set of patch notes, Valve doesn't mince words; it's banning cheaters and penalizing parties caught benefiting from their activities.


As noted by IGN, Counter-Strike 2 cheaters risk more than just their own in-game freedom. Valve's update warns that when multiple people are caught cheating, players partied with them risk their own account status. The patch notes read: 


“When one or more party members get convicted of cheating and permanently banned, all their associates will be penalized with loss of Profile Rank and CS Rating".


In addition to the cheater-by-association ban, the patch notes target folks hoping to piggyback their way through player rankings with higher-skilled friends. “In Premier, players with a very high established CS Rating are not allowed to party with accounts that do not have an established CS Rating.”


It seems this is part of Valve’s latest solution to address the lengthy history of cheating in the Counter-Strike community, though the CS2 developer doesn't really explain why or how you'll get flagged as an associate. The company implemented its first iterations of Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) back in 2002 and tuned the system into a cheat-seeking missle over the last decade. 


These are but some of the changes, improvements, and bug fixes found in the first wave of Counter-Strike 2 updates. Valve, in very Valve behavior, launched Counter-Strike 2 at 4:40 p.m. ET on a Wednesday, officially retiring CS:GO.

        <updated>2023-09-28T20:43:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Own a Nintendo Switch, but have nothing to do this weekend? Well do we have news for you. From September 28 to October 3, anyone subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online service can take the action/adventure RPG Eastward for a spin. 


Eastward, developed by Pixpil Games and published by Chucklefish, is an RPG where players must find a way to escape an underground society that is on its way towards devastation. Here’s a full synopsis of Eastward from its dedicated website:



“In the near-future, society is fast hurtling down the path of destruction. An unknown, toxic presence has spread and poisoned the air. Those who could escape flocked to villages underground to start a new life, and as new generations were forged, they soon forgot all memories of the blue skies above. But for a hardworking miner and a mysterious young girl, the hope of a thriving outside world beckons…


Escape the tyrannical clutches of subterranean society and join Eastward’s unlikely duo, Sam and John, on an exciting adventure to the land above! Travel across the world by rail to uncover the mystery of Sam’s powers, and the truth behind the deadly miasma.”






A full-game trial


As usual with these promotions, those who purchase the game after playing this trial can carry over their progress. Additionally, the full game is discounted 50% through October 10, meaning you can nab this normally $24.99 game for $12.49. 


Participants of the Game Trial can also acquire 100 My Nintendo Platinum Points. To earn these points, check out Missions & Rewards in the Nintendo Switch Online app on your console.


Eastward launched on September 16, 2021. In our review of the game, Eric Van Allen gave it an 8/10, saying “Eastward is something a fan of pixel art and good music, with a weakness for video game nostalgia, deserves to check out. It’s just also a journey that left me wanting a little more.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally revealed back in April, Apogee Entertainment and Emberheart Games' Vexlands is here for everyone to try. The release window is still penciled in for sometime in early 2024, but now a new demo offers a taste of adventure. Despite the fact that this one has curses, monsters, and other threats, there are plenty of opportunities to relax throughout. Check out some of the open-world crafting in action in the new trailer below. 




Vexlands is billed as a "cozy crafting adventure," but you'd be forgiven for not seeing much of that in the preview. Developer Emberheart Games is looking to strike a balance between cozy and perilous with this one. Sure, you could strike out in an attempt to explore the land and hunt for resources. You could also take some time to rest and relax in your ever-expanding homestead. Decorate your place, tame wild animals, fish, and farm if that's more to your liking.

Are you a cozy enough dude to cleanse the land?


When you're done chilling, there's still going to be a world to save and tiles to unlock. Vexlands features procedurally generated environments with dynamic weather, and each area can unveil something either helpful or harmful. You might find artifacts hinting at the past, or precious resources for trading or crafting. Or you might run into some nasty enemies or a sudden strike of lightning. You can roll the dice yourself with the demo, which is live on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. Vexlands will also be available on GOG when it launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might seem sus, but you have to believe me when I tell you that, according to a recent PlayStation blog, Among US VR is on its way to PSVR2. In the past, we’ve reported on the virtual reality version of the hit party game coming to Steam and Meta Quest, but now that the PSVR2 has been out for a while, it’d seem Sony is hitting the Emergency Alert button and planning a release for its headset.


In the PlayStation blog, Kat De Shields-Moon and Adam Kuta of Schell Games who, alongside Innersloth and Robot Teddy, represent a third of Among Us VR’s developers, confirmed the game will cost $9.99 when it launches for PSVR2. Outside of a "coming soon" promise, it's when Among Us VR will launch, but we do know that this version of the game arrives with two maps: The Skeld II and Polus Point.




The Skeld II is, of course, based on the infamous map of a similar name. Polus Point, on the other hand, is also based on the Polus map from the original game, but it “features 50% more tasks, nine new rooms with *cough* delicious hidden objects, and brand-new kill and ejection animations,” according to De Shields-Moon and Kuta. While they gave no indication of a release date, you can wishlist Among Us VR on the PlayStation Store beginning today to be notified of when that changes.

        <updated>2023-09-28T19:57:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insomniac Games has announced several new accessibility options for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Most of the support expands on systems found in previous Spider-Man games and other Insomniac titles like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.


The announcement came via the PlayStation Blog with Insomniac developers over accessibility design and UX, explaining expanded functionality and those uses. 


Alongside the difficulty settings in prior games, Spider-Man 2 also features what Insomniac calls Challenge Level Modifiers. These allow for aspects such as enemies' health, damage, and awareness to receive some finer tweaking.


Features like Chase Assist alter chases to give players an advantage, such as slowing down the target's top speed. Repeated button presses from QTEs can also be changed to button taps or holds. There's even room to adjust Spider-Man 2's gameplay speeds, with options to play at 70, 50, or 30 percent of the original, real-time rates.


Audio settings are adjustable, too, with high or low-frequency sounds having a toggle. There's even a filter for notch frequency to remove certain frequency ranges.


Other features will make it into the game after launch. One of these is audio descriptions featuring a voice-over narrating cutscenes and QTEs. The other is a screen reader featuring audio descriptions for elements like tutorials or menus. Those two are especially helpful for blind players but are not coming on launch. Instead, they are a part of an update coming in December 2023.


Increased accessibility in games is always a great thing to hear. It helps expand a game's potential audience who otherwise might have trouble with certain elements. Hopefully, Insomniac's accessibility support works as intended to make playing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 as comfortable as possible when it releases October 20 for PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like the year of Amy the Hedgehog, and we're all benefitting. Not only is the spritely pink hedgehog playable in the upcoming Sonic Superstars, but she co-stars in the biggest Sonic Frontiers update, out today on all platforms. She struts her stuff in the Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon update trailer, along with Tails, Knuckles, and Sonic.


Amy brings some new tools to the combat trade in the update. She's paired with her iconic hammer, but she also wields a set of cards to liven up the action. Not content with using them to attack enemies, she can also swirl them around like helicopter blades to give her more jump distance. Amy can also gain some intense speed by turning them into an exercise wheel of sorts — oddly appropriate for a hedgehog.




Amy, Tails, and Knuckles return to give a hand in Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon update trailer


Of course, we also have Tails and Knuckles. The latter brings his fists to the fight, while Tails returns rocking the Tornado 2 mech. I don't recall seeing that thing since Sonic Adventure 2. In Sonic Frontiers, the transformer plane looks like an optional summon. Tails can use it to fly around in the world, but we don't see how it fares in combat.

Sonic Frontiers: The Final Update trailer offers a glimpse of what it's bringing to the table. Beyond the three aforementioned playable characters, it also includes a new story, new challenges, and more collectibles. The update brings bug fixes and quality-of-life changes as well. Sega is being mum on what else is included in the package, but fans will know once the free update lands today at 5 PM PT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you needed a reason to become an early adopter of the Meta Quest 3, here’s one: Xbox Cloud Gaming is on its way to the next gen headset. 




In a post by the official Meta Quest VR account on Twitter, the company confirmed that players can soon experience games like Halo Infinite, Starfield, and Forza Motorsport on the device. Furthermore, the attached video showcases how the virtual screen should look in a mixed reality environment. 


This news, in particular, is actually a long time coming. Back in October of 2022, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that Xbox Cloud Gaming would appear on the platform. Then, during this year's Meta Connect Keynote presentation, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the service will launch in December. This was, admittedly, a small note in a long presentation, so no details were revealed that the Twitter post didn't already cover.


Xbox Cloud Gaming is currently included as a part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which costs $16.99 per month. The Meta Blog confirms that this same subscription service will work here. Do note that players will also need a "supported controller," which presumably means something Xbox compatible.


The Meta Quest 3 will launch on October 10. Preorders are available now, with prices starting at $499.99.

Atooi has revealed it will be launching an updated version of the award-winning Dementium: The Ward on the Switch eShop on 12th October.
Originally released on Nintendo DS in 2007 with a 3DS remaster following in 2015, Dementium: The Ward is a first-person survival horror in which you take on the role of William Redmoor, an amnesiac who must escape the confines of a derelict and dangerous hospital. Based on the remastered 3DS version, this new release looks to retain as much of the essence of the original while ensuring the gameplay and UI translate well to a console experience.

Epic had acquired SuperAwesome in 2020. 250 people will be leaving Epic as a result of these divestitures. 
“For a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,” Sweeney writes in his statement. “I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retr…]]></summary>

The upcoming Hellboy video game from Upstream Arcade is being delayed by two weeks to ensure "that all players - longtime fans and newcomers to the Hellboy universe alike - receive the best experience possible", publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment has revealed today.
Hellboy Web of Wyrd will now be launching on 18th October 2023, right in-between some of the month's biggest releases. The upcoming third-person beat 'em up with procedurally generated levels looks particularly striking thanks to its hand-drawn-style visuals that attempt to recreate the magic of creator Mike Mignola's art style. The late Lance Reddick plays the iconic Big Red who is sent to the realm of Wyrd after a Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.) goes missing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago, we were given some hints as to what to expect in Stardew Valley's 1.6 update. Now, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has given us a sneak peek of what's actually coming to one of the best indie games ever made.


In a recent post on Twitter, the developer outlined a number of things coming to Stardew Valley. For starters, there's going to be a new "major festival" as well as some "mini festivals" as well.




There's also going to be more than 100 lines of new dialogue, a new farm type, winter outfits for villagers, and support for eight people playing multiplayer (on PC, at least). That's not everything either, as the post also says to expect "new secrets and more."


When's the update coming?


Barone has made it quite clear in that past that they don't want to rush the new Stardew Valley update. This is no exception, as the tweet says there's no release date yet and things are "still in development."


However, a post on Steam echoing the sneak peek states that version 1.6 is "close to being finished," but testing, polishing, and translations need to be complete before it's ready.


Alongside this, Barone is also working on a new project called Haunted Chocolatier. We still don't know much about this upcoming game, but it appears to feature a similar aesthetic to Stardew Valley.


For now, keep an eye out for update 1.6. We can only hope it'll be rolling out soon, but the developer has (rightly) said that it will release when it's ready and not a moment before.

Every spare idle moment I had, I'd be bouncing balls down its infinite planetary mining silos, mesmerised by the vacant stare of its iconic white Holedown worm (my record is still 1090m, in case you're wondering). It's a most joyous day, then (as much as it can be on a day like today), to hear that solo developer Grapefrukt will soon be back with another ball-bouncing beaut in the form of Subpar Pool, which is coming to PC (and phones) on October 12th.

While it might sound complex, the worlds these orbs contain steer you carefully towards a clear goal every time: solve the problem, then grab your orb on the way out. Before you know it, you're carrying orbs within orbs and you're unravelling a cosmic mystery where the floor might be a biomechanical stingray or the path forward a spinal cord composed of ferns. I am convinced everyone should spring to action and hoist an orb on their shoulders. I couldn't put mine down.

The abstract environmental puzzle game has become its own genre in recent years, with some telling stories that are strange but easy to parse and others being so opaque that the player can ascribe almost any meaning to what is transpiring on screen. On this difficult-to-define spectrum, Cocoon lands on the latter half of the scale. I basically never had any idea why I was doing what I was doing or what the larger goal was, but I didn’t mind for a moment because the puzzles scratch your brain so effectively that I was always eager to complete wh…]]></summary>

Epic Games, the creator of Unreal Engine and the ludicrously popular Fortnite, is reportedly laying off 16% of its workforce, which works out at around 900 employees.
The news comes via Bloomberg, with a person familiar with the matter stating that an internal announcement of the job cuts was sent out in a staff memo. In the memo, CEO Tim Sweeney stated “For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn. I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect, I see this was unrealistic.”

Gaming franchises need to evolve to stay relevant. Whether it's expanding on certain mechanics or overhauling quality-of-life features, any great series that's been around as long as Bomberman is forced to make changes or be left in the dust. Unfortunately for Super Bomberman R 2, the changes it makes to the formula are mostly unsuccessful. While games with your friends can be thrilling, online play is hit-or-miss, and its story mode is a huge letdown. I respect Konami for trying new things with Bomberman. …]]></summary>

Disgaea 7 is out on October 3, and honestly, it's crazy that this series is still alive. I've been a huge fan of it since it first came out, and have been following NIS for over 20 years. I'm glad that they're still around, and the industry as a whole is better off with them in it.


As for the other marquee games, we have Cocoon dropping on September 29, and Silent Hope will arrive on October 3. As usual, there's a ton of other stuff to sift through!

This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi's Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  
As with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.

This week in Japan, Pikmin 1+2 came out on top with a total of 23,941 units sold in its physical debut. Following closely is, of course, Pikmin 4 with a further 22,894 copies sold. There's not a lot between the two, which potentially suggests that many will have opted for a digital copy of Pikmin 1+2 earlier in the year.
Elsewhere, the rather brilliant Lies of P has made its debut on the PS5 with a total of 9,493 copies sold to come in at number three. Otherwise, the rest of the line-up this week looks petty familiar, with Super Bomberman R 2 rounding out the top ten.

Still, as much as Prime Big Deal Days is sillily named and oddly timed (is Black Friday not just a month later?), it may yet prove useful as a source of cheap PC gaming hardware. Amazon sales usually are, with SSDs, gaming mice, keyboards, and even graphics cards reliably among their discounted wares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh my Dog.
The '90s was a decade-long blitz of out-there marketing campaigns, lads mags, and PlayStation; rich experimentation with the polygon and a concerted effort to push the boundaries of bad taste. Rise of The Triad, based on a modified version of ID’s Wolfenstein engine, was initially pitched as a sequel before becoming a standalone PC title in 1995. Developed by Apogee Software (which became 3D Realms), this 'Ludicrous Edition' is handled by Nightdive Studios, who has a solid track record in remastering classic PC titles.
Rise of the Triad follows H.U.N.T, a crack UN covert team tasked with infiltrating San Nicolas Island to stop a strange, Nazi-esque cult from launching nukes at Los Angeles. While your team, a band of operatives with different properties in speed, firepower, and strength, are typically fashioned, the game itself is a bizarre, otherworldly romp through maze-like stages littered with the dark and bizarre, abstract and insane, peppered with occult motifs and oddly futuristic apparatus.

In a recent interview with PC Gamer, director Gabe Amatangelo said both the DLC and 2.0 patch represent the "last big updates" for Cyberpunk 2077. While the studio will still do "a little something more," the team won't be bringing massive overhauls to it going forward.




Instead, CDPR is looking to move onto the follow-up. In the interview, Amatangelo says the developer's next project will be "Cyberpunk 2. Or 'Orion,' I should say, whatever we end up naming it."


Not abandoned entirely


It does look like CDPR won't abandon Cyberpunk 2077 just yet. There will likely be hotfixes and smaller updates in the future. However, it seems the company is now interested in new projects.


It's going to be a busy time for the Polish studio over the next few years. As well as a follow-up to Cyberpunk, we're also getting new entries in the Witcher series, as well as an official remake of the first Witcher game.


The recent updates have definitely been a boon for CD Projekt Red's dystopian RPG. At the time of writing, Cyberpunk 2077 is the second-best selling game on Steam. Phantom Liberty is the third-best. The only thing beating them is the recently released Counter-Strike 2.

Originally set to release on October 24 alongside the PC version, the team has delayed the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game to spring of next year. The PC version will still launch next month. 
As for why, Colossal Order says in an update made on Twitter that the team needs more time to reach quality targets it has set for the console release. 
"Mayors, we're hard at work getting the game ready for release," the update reads. "We've come to realize that we need more time to reach the quality targets set for console. We want to provide the best experience for our players, we're updating the release window for Xbox & PS5 to Spring 2024."

        <updated>2023-09-28T12:37:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyenas was the next release from the British studio Creative Assembly. Unfortunately, it's recently been confirmed by publisher Sega that the project – along with some others – has ceased development.


The company made the announcement (translated by Sega Sammy) saying that the "business environment surrounding the Consumer area has been rapidly changing." The message goes on to cite the effects of COVID-19 as part of the reason for Sega having to "implement structural reforms aimed at increasing efficiency."




This means that Hyenas has officially been cancelled in response to "lower profitability" in Europe, as have some other "unannounced titles." At the time of writing, Creative Assembly has not made a statement about these events. In fact, the game's Steam page still says it's "coming soon."


A slap in the face for fans


What's worse is the game had just had its closed beta. The last post on the official Hyenas Twitter page thanked fans for their support, adding that the team was figuring out "where we go next."


Although better known for the Total War series, Creative Assembly moved away from historical strategy to bring us Alien: Isolation in 2014. This was not only a terrifying and beautiful love letter to Ridley Scott's iconic 1979 film, but an example of how the Alien franchise could successfully translate to video games.


Hyenas was going to be a "hero-based, multiplayer extraction shooter" that pitted you against others in a sci-fi world containing "epic zero-G combat." Sadly, that'll never come to fruition. Fans who played and enjoyed the recent closed beta will no doubt be saddened by the news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MINTROCKET, the developer behind Dave the Diver, has announced their next title, which might not be what you’d expect. NAKWON: LAST PARADISE, according to the developer, is “an ambitious zombie apocalypse stealth-survival game, set in Seoul, in which players must use their wits to avoid detection, loot items, and escape to survive.” The game is a 16-player PvPvE experience and will be available on PC.




In this multiplayer survival experience, players will take on the role of survivors while the zombies will be controlled by the game’s AI. Like with other games set in a post-apocalypse, the zombies can be lured from their route or position by making sounds. If the undead enemies see you, they’ll chase after you, so be wary of how and where you’re moving about the environment. 


Also like in other zombie-related media, “human beings are the last ones you can trust,” and you must be okay with taking what you need from other players, regardless of what that means for them, according to the game's page on Steam.


"We wanted to make a real survival game where you have to hide, run away, eat, and survive in a world where Zombies hunt Humans, rather than the other way around," said director Jang Kyoung Han. "The game's development started less than a year ago, but getting community feedback is going to be very important to us, and so we’d like to start sharing information early and openly.”


NAKWON: LAST PARADISE is listed on Steam as ‘coming soon,’ and no other information on a potential release date has been made public. MINTROCKET has created a server on Discord for any prospective players to discuss the game and its updates. The developer plans to host a pre-alpha later in 2023.

We wish we had a better way to tee it up than to just point you to the following reveal from the official Japanese Nintendo Store Twitter account, but we don't.

More specifically, Lord of Nothing hits consoles and PC on November 21. This DLC takes players to brand new locations, introduces new characters, and tasks players with taking down new foes. It continues the story of Sendri and Rekarth, and where we last saw them in the Through the Ashes DLC, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega, the publisher behind next month's Sonic Superstars, has canceled some unannounced titles in development and Creative Assembly's first-person shooter, Hyenas. The company cites "lower profitability of the European region." 
As a result of the lower profitability, Sega reviewed various in-development projects from its developers in Europe and the result is the cancelation of Hyenas, which just finished up a closed beta on PC less than a week ago, and some other unannounced games. Eurogamer reports that layoffs at Creative Assembly are expected in the wake of this decision. 


"We will implement reduction of various fixed expenses at several group companies in relevant region, centered on the Creative Assembly Ltd.," a Sega press release reads. "We expect to incur one-time expenses related to reduction of fixed expenses. We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision." 
Sega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that "there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time." 
Sega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022. It has been playable in recent closed betas.]]></summary>

Long-time Nintendo Life readers will be aware of the love-hate (mainly hate) relationship we’ve had with the FIFA series over the course of the Switch’s life.
The first Switch entry, FIFA 18, was considered a positive start, even though it felt feature-light compared to other consoles and was clearly based on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game. FIFA 19 added a couple of basic new modes, but wasn’t massively different, and that’s when our goodwill started to drop quicker than Neymar in the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a certain amount of confusion and alarm over the announcement of Nakwon: Last Paradise, a dingy third-person zombie survival adventure with a big emphasis on stealth, from the creators of Dave the Diver, a bright, breezy uramaki roll of a game that mixes restaurant management with side-on undersea exploration. Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?


Thing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake! Let's have a look at the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced earlier this year and releasing about four days shy of its promised Summer release window (the first day of Fall was September 23), Counter-Strike 2 is now suddenly available on Steam. You can check out the game's launch trailer below.


The game has been playable in limited test form for some time, and rumors were swirling that the game would release soon, but it is still a surprise to see the game suddenly available on Steam. It has taken over Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's spot on Steam and functions as an update to that game.
Below you will find some details from a press release for the game's official release.
Built on the Source 2 engine, Counter-Strike 2 is modernized with realistic physically-based rendering, state of the art networking, and upgraded Community Workshop tools.
In addition to the classic objective-focused gameplay that Counter-Strike pioneered in 1999, Counter-Strike 2 features:
All-new CS Ratings with the updated Premier mode
Global and Regional leaderboards
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Redesigned visual effects and audio
All items from CS:GO moving forward to CS2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation head Jim Ryan is leaving the company, according to a press release from Sony Interactive Entertainment. Ryan has served as president and CEO since his appointment in 2018. Ryan’s tenure at Sony spans nearly 30 years, during which he’s held numerous leadership roles, including serving as the head of Sony Europe after former SIEE president Andrew House passed the torch in 2011.
Why Is Jim Ryan Leaving Sony?
"I’ve found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America," Ryan said in the press release. "I will leave having been privileged to work on products that have touched millions of lives across the world; PlayStation will always be part of my life, and I feel more optimistic than ever about the future of SIE. I want to thank Yoshida-san for placing so much trust in me and being an incredibly sensitive and supportive leader."
Ryan remains at the company until March 2024. Effective April 1, 2024, Sony Group Corporation President, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki will step in as SIE’s interim CEO, reporting to Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. Effective October 2023, Sony Interactive Entertainment will appoint Totoki as chairman to aid PlayStation ahead of Ryan’s exit.]]></summary>

Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the news on social media, citing two sources who spoke to Bloomberg News. Sony officially announced the decision later, along with executive statements, confirming that Ryan has made the decision to retire in March 2024 after almost 30 years at PlayStation.


Sony Group President, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki will take up the role of Chairman of SIE starting October 2023. On April 1, 2024, Totoki will be appointed as the interim CEO while continuing his current role at Sony Group, as Sony searches for Ryan's …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember when Nintendo first announced Tetris 99. It was such an insane idea — I mean, playing Tetris like it was a battle royale, with 98 other people (or CPUs)? But, as the saying goes, the idea was just crazy enough for it to work, as there have been times where Tetris 99 is the only reason I have a Switch.


In the time since this revolutionary way of playing Tetris was released and today, it’s been made clear that Nintendo wants to turn ‘99’-type games into a genre. We’ve had the short lived Super Mario Bros. 35 that, while technically not a ‘99’-type game, plays the exact same way as if it were; Pac-Man 99, a chaotic twist on the classic game; and now we have F-ZERO 99, leading the younger generations to ask ‘what’s F-ZERO’?


In any case, the question of the day is: what’s next? W…]]></summary>

Capcom released Resident Evil 4 remake earlier this year, and despite missing some of the original’s most memorable moments, it was a deserved critical hit. It’s a fantastic, updated reimaging of Leon’s original horrific adventure through an approximation of rural Spain. Separate Ways is represents a different remake, putting players in control of Ada Wong and reexamining the expansion initially added to the PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil 4 in 2005. The DLC lets players see the story from a new perspective, fill in some narrative gaps, learn m…]]></summary>

        <id>121241</id>

        <updated>2023-09-27T17:09:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix announced in 2021 that it was developing an animated Tomb Raider series starring Lara Croft. Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. 
There's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. 
Check out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. 
In the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well. In terms of new Tomb Raider games, the first three PlayStation 1 titles are getting remastered next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has revealed the first look at its Devil May Cry anime series coming to the subscription streaming service soon. First announced in 2018, it is being developed by Capcom, Studio Mir, and Netflix's Castlevania executive producer Adi Shankar. 
Netflix announced this anime today with a short teaser trailer that gives us our first look at its Dante, who is, of course, escaping a would-be death by sword while firing off bullets from his two trademark pistols. The short snippets of animation we see in the teaser look great, just like Netflix's Castlevania series and its upcoming Castlevania: Nocturne anime, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


Netflix revealed little else about the show although it did call today's teaser a "SSStylish first look." There is no release date for Netflix's Devil May Cry but Netflix says it's coming soon. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Devil May Cry 5 review and then watch this trailer for Netflix's Castlevania: Nocturne after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has revealed its October 2023 lineup of free games for PlayStation Plus members and, with it being the month of Halloween, the selections definitely fit the vibe. That's because PlayStation Plus subscribers can add Dead Space spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, to their libraries alongside Weird West and the ultra-terrifying Farming Simulator 22. All three games can be added to libraries starting next week on Tuesday, October 3, and players have until Monday, November 6, to do so. 
Below, we've included snippets of what PlayStation has to say about each game alongside our reviews (when applicable): 
The Callisto Protocol 
Game Informer's review
Weird West

Farming Simulator 22
Before all three of these games go live for PlayStation Plus members next week, subscribers still have time to add this month's offerings – Saints Row, Black Desert: Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero – to their libraries.

Unlike the Tides of the Foscari DLC that was released earlier this year for $2, this Whiteout update will be free on all platforms where you can play Vampire Survivors. 
"It's the first trailer for Whiteout, the new free update we're working on (patch v1.7)," Poncle's announcement tweet reads. "Get ready for a frosty new stage, a new character, weapon, and more. Coming soon to all platforms."

And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall.

I got my hands on Alan Wake 2 during a recent preview event, letting me explore two slices of the game as the titular troubled author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. You can read about my experience with Alan’s segment here, but Saga’s side shows plenty of promise and narrative intrigue. 
My demo begins with Saga in the third chapter of her campaign. She arrives in the small town of Watery in search of the Clicker, a serial killer who seemingly has ties to the menacing Cult of the Tree.

Horizon Forbidden West is the 2022 follow-up to 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn, and it was one of our favorite games of last year – read about why in Game Informer's review here. It hit both PS5 and PlayStation 4, but if you missed it last year, PlayStation and developer Guerrilla Games are making it easier to experience the full Forbidden West package on PS5 next week.

Notably, Puha's tweet specifically names "Xbox Series X," and not the weaker Xbox Series S console. As it stands, it's unclear if the aforementioned Performance mode will come to Xbox Series S consoles; Game Informer has reached out to Remedy for confirmation and will update this story if we learn more.

Lies of P hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC earlier this month. It's one of our favorite games of the year – read about why in Game Informer's Lies of P review here – but it's a tough soulslike that kicked our butts more than once. However, today's Update 1.2.0.0 should make the game easier overall so if you've taken a break from saving Krat with Pinocchio, now might be a good time to jump back in.

It introduces Dualshock 4 and DualSense controller support alongside a host of changes to enemies, the execution of the game’s Fable Arts or gear-specific special moves, item drop rates and the duration of stagger windows. The overarching aim seems to be to make the game easier, and as I’m sure you’re expecting, a few Lies of P fans - and, it turns out, RPS staffers - are ticked off about that.

Earlier this week, SAG-AFTRA union members voted yes to authorize a video game strike. However, the union said it was not yet striking; rather, this strike authorization gave it more leverage at its next bargaining table session where it would try to strike a new Interactive Media Agreement contract with producers and employers.
That negotiation session ended yesterday and SAG-AFTRA and Video Game Employers released a joint statement stating negotiation has concluded but that no deal was reached. 
Here's the joint statement sent to Game Informer, in full:

Earlier this year, in June, Don't Nod announced Banishers will be released in November but today, the studio delayed its release to next year. More specifically, Banishers will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 13, 2024. 
As for why, Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert says the team is aiming for a "less saturated period" of video game releases, alluding to the swath of games releasing in the coming weeks, including next month's Assassin's Creed Mirage, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, and more (and that's just some of what's releasing in October, which then leads right into November).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate "Metascore" as a kind of "magic". The FAQ cheekily invites you to "peek behind the curtain", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the "weighting" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.
You could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like most people, I had assumed EA shut down Anthem soon after dashing BioWare's hopes to overhaul and revive the sci-fi looter-shooter. I was surprised to see Anthem on Game Pass while poking around checking out space games which are not Starfield. It did shut down, didn't it? Surely it did. So why's it on Game Pass? If an 80GB download is the price I pay for a ha-ha-hilarious joke post where I review a spinning loading ball or server error message, so be it. Let's go. Wait. Hang on. I'm playing this. This is a game. This is still a game!

The Payday series has always entertained using a mixture of competing gameplay mechanics. Going from an engaging yet sometimes confusing heist-based simulation to a chaotic Left 4 Dead-inspired shooter, each title presented a wildly shifting mission structure that encouraged cooperative play. Payday 3 doesn't reinvent the wheel, as it offers many of the same core concepts found in the previous games. That said, some smart design choices and its fresh coat of paint help elevate it above this popular series' previous iterations.

The city feels alive with merchants, townsfolk, guards, palaces, and more. It's vibrant, lively, and, well, looks and sounds like a city. It's painted with hues of desert orange and "Arabian Nights" blue skies, something intentional, according to artistic director Jean-Luc Sala. 
Having lived in the region, Sala says he and his visual team infused many sights he remembers near the Tigris River to bring Baghdad to life. The result is beautiful, if my two hours of hands-on time is any indication. With Mirage meant to serve as an homage to the first Assassin's Creed that started the series in 2007, Sala and the rest of the team at Ubisoft Bordeaux…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt have formally commented on the presence of references to the Russia-Ukraine war in Cyberpunk 2077's recently added Ukrainian localisation, apologising for dialogue lines "that can be considered offensive by Russian gamers", while reiterating their support for Ukraine.


In case you missed it, the Ukrainian script and menu localisation currently includes a number of antagonistic references to Russians and to the on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine. One dialogue line refers to a particular bandit group as "rusnia", and there's photo mode menu text for a squatting character that translates as "like a Russian". There's also lore text that apparently riffs on Ukrainian government rhetoric during the war, and a piece of in-game wallart that alludes to the dispute between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis - a sort of mobile gaming RPG sandwich of the original Final Fantasy VII and its spin-offs Crisis Core and The First Soldier, plus gacha mechanics - is coming to PC and Steam, publisher Square Enix have announced. The Steam release will share data with the mobile version.



Ever Crisis on mobile is a free-to-play game with microtransactions and curvy, colourful chibi-style visuals. It's Final Fantasy: Polly Pocket Edition, sort of. Play breaks down into missions with turn-based battles and brief narrative sequences. The idea is that you can pack in a few minutes of Cloud gaming (no, not that kind) while waiting for your tube. But how will that formula square up on PC, and what to make of the game's reportedly very aggressive microtransaction pop-ups? Fingers crossed they'll rebadge it as a standard pay-upfront release and tear out all the gacha.

It’s something that would have had a six episode animated series, broadcast out of order at 1am. It’s a testament to that moment in pop culture where the coolest thing imaginable was a tortured guy in a trenchcoat, holding a gun in each hand and fighting monsters. Whether you regard this aesthetic with respect or disgust will help you determine whether there’s anything here for you.

Scandalously, we don't appear to have covered this indie sci-fi FPS on these golden pages, so here's a quick overview: you're the high-jumping, sword-wielding, bullet-pumping lovechild of Deus Ex and DOOM, galloping through a world that recalls the Imperial bases and sewers of Dark Forces, taking down grungy pixelart sprites by means of precision parries, grabs, combos, headshots, terrain traps and much more besides. Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!


The game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay. Valve's testers have denied Fortune's Run approval to launch on the platform. Among the reasons, according to developer Team Fortune themselves, is that Valve don't feel the game's content warning for sexual assault is actually necessary.

Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever.
Or at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles "an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess. Perhaps there's something incredibly clever you can say about all the flying cities.

Marcus Stewart has played it (which you can read about here) and even showcased some combat gameplay (which you can watch here). Now, the footage below is set in the vibrant grasslands near the city of Kalm and showcases Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's not-quite-open-world gameplay but pretty close to open-world gameplay. We also get to see some Chocobo-riding, including a glimpse at how Red XIII, a quadruped animal, mounts the iconic Final Fantasy bird.

CD Projekt Red actually recommends just starting over or you can skip right to the Phantom Liberty content early in the game. For many, however, you will likely be revisiting a save you haven’t touched in a few years. Below are just some important refreshers to take with you back into the game, as well as some details about some of the new elements of Night City.

This is a simple one that likely used to be second nature, but to put your weapon away, just double tap the weapon change button (Y on Xbox, triangle on PlayStation). In Cyberpunk, having your weapon out or holstered represents two very different personalities t…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minekos-night-market-review"/>
        <updated>2023-09-25T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, "What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island." To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.
Instead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.
But this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is, according to our reviewer Graham, "perhaps the best expansion pack ever made." Feh, small potatoes – Phantom Liberty’s most prestigious achievement is surely how it heralds a new ray tracing feature that makes Cyberpunk 2077 look and run a tiny bit better. On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.
Hello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.

Because it exists," the developer's vice-president of marketing Lisa Pendse has revealed in a new interview from this year's Tokyo Game Show. "It's just not ready. It's simmering." Hmm.

The authentic replica of the world wide web circa 1999 was originally designed to be little more than ornate level select screens in a stylish endless runner-style game, for example, providing extra context for your adventures pursuing "outlaws on the Hypnospace Highway". 
Games change during development, of course, and it’s not unusual for once substantial ideas to be left on the cutting room floor. But seeing as Hypnospace Outlaw is our pick for the RPS Game Club this month, I wanted to reach out to the game’s creator Jay Tholen to ask some questions about these unlikely origins, its influences and its lasting legacy. What happened to the Hypnospace Highway? And what comes next for the world of Hypnospace?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reworked skill trees and new minigames aside, Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update includes a Ukrainian localisation of the game's million-plus-word script. It turns out the Ukrainian version is awash with references to Russia's on-going invasion of Ukraine, all of it seemingly in support of the latter. The news comes via Zone of Games, who have published a few side-by-side comparisons from the game's files, underlining differences between the English and Ukrainian translations in various bits of dialogue and menu text.
I asked the organisers of Indie Cup - a Kyiv, Ukraine-based digital festival of games like Pahris Entertainment's upcoming Space Wreck - to help me double-check the Ukrainian version's alterations. The Indie Cup team's Arsenii Tarasov was happy to oblige, and also volunteered a few further examples of more... adventurous localisation from his own research, supported with screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya is leaving Platinum Games next month. Kamiya co-founded the Osaka, Japan-based studio in 2006 and later went on to direct games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101. His final day at Platinum will be October 12, according to both a statement released by the studio and Kamiya on his personal Twitter account. 
As for why, neither Platinum's statement nor Kamiya's own tweets indicate a specific reason. Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. 
Here's Platinum's statement:

And here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: 
However, I feel this outcome is for the best.
September 25, 2023
Before co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. 
Kamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.
While waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101. Read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review after that and then read our review of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Do you think Kamiya will stay in game development? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's happening again. As sure as Square Enix overestimating their sales projections, as sure as John Riccitiello pissing off every available customer, EVE Online developers CCP will try to make a first-person shooter set in the same universe. 

This time it's called EVE Vanguard, a shooter "module" which will sit within the EVE launcher and asychronously connect to EVE Online.

Sharing their creation with the rest of the word initially appeared to be too expensive, but then they discovered a new technology called BitTorrent. Fast forward two decades and their “Fanimatrix" release is the oldest active torrent that's still widely shared today.

You can already guess the third sentence: the servers have been a disaster at launch, with players forced to queue for long periods just to play alone, if they can manage to play at all. It currently sits "Mostly Negative" reviews on Steam - that's 31% positive after almost 19,000 reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. 


Pawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.

That's still a hefty chunk of change, but it's worth it for a gaming CPU that outfights the Core i9 13900K and trades blows with the much more expensive Ryzen 9 7950X3D, coming well ahead in some games and a tiny bit behind in others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My goodness, what a close thing. Fading Afternoon is a game of excellent vibes as you stroll around the city living your faintly sad life. It's also an incredibly cool 2D beat 'em up that is, at its best, comfortably the best I can think of. But the boundaries between the two are too frustrating to make it the legend it ought to be.
It's a sequel to The Friends Of Ringo Ishikawa, a game I didn't really vibe with. FA is much improved, a sort of pared down Yakuza game about beating rival gangsters up in between story bits about an ageing Maruyama trying to get the band back together after leaving prison and apparently not caring that he's dying. I do recommend it, but be prepared for some friction.

You see, I'd hoped Starfield's side quests would be a bit more fun than collecting magic space rocks. But basically every side hustle I've tackled have all been the equivalents of early MMO fodder and I'm so tired of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is a menace. Even among Elden Ring’s cast of bastard-hard bosses, the Goddess of Rot distinguishes herself as an ender of lives, a relentless steel tempest that has shredded the most prepared and dextrous of adventurers. She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.

Or, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky "RockyNoHands" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The polished-up 2.0 update for Cyberpunk 2077 is out now, ahead of its Phantom Liberty expansion on September 26th. I’ve been trying out both, partly to see if the 2.0 newly raised hardware requirement of SSD storage is a warning worth heeding.


Hard lines against hard drive installations are new to PC games, but it was only a couple of weeks ago when Starfield showed the dangers of crossing them. Broken audio, regular freeze-ups, load times so long you could measure them with a calendar...  an SSD really is the only way to play Starfield, and it sounded like Cyberpunk 2077 would follow suit. "We advise against running the game on an HDD (or on a SD card on Steam Deck) due to lower bandwidth which may cause new content to not stream properly," reads CD Projekt Red’s 2.0 patch notes. That’s us told.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a clear decade since the last entry in this co-op crimeathon FPS series, so I was interested to play Payday 3. Payday is exactly the sort of online multiplayer I can get behind: PvE with clear but theoretically malleable goals (theft!). But although compared to Crime Boss: Rockay City it's a crushing 60st monster truck tyre, Payday 3 isn't really reinventing the Payday 2 wheel. In some respects you might think it's rolling backwards, and while dedicated Payday 2 players may well switch over to the current gen iteration, you get the sense they'll be complaining about things the whole time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tales of the Shire is a cozy new game set in The Lord of the Rings universe and it's coming out sometime next year. Developed by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and props company that worked on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and published by Private Division, Tales of the Shire promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit life. 
Private Division revealed little about the game with its announcement yesterday, although it did release a teaser trailer that captures the vibes of living on The Shire. Check out the Tales of the Shire teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"Your cosy Hobbit life awaits in Tales of the Shire, a heart-warming new Lord of the Rings game by Wētā Workshop and Private Division," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "Coming 2024." 
And that's all we know about the game. Here's hoping we learn more soon because it sounds like a great premise. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Microsoft submitted a new deal to the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. Microsoft did this to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard approved by the CMA after the regulator previously blocked it over cloud gaming concerns. One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. 
The CMA says it has "identified limited residual concerns with the new deal" but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft's role) that the CMA "has provisionally concluded should address these issues." The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so.

Wētā Workshop and Private Division have announced Tales of the Shire, a "heart-warming" experience that will release on PC in 2024. I've got a live action trailer for you, in which a young person doodles pictures of Hobbits, while seated at a desk intriguingly strewn with modern appliances such as laptops and assorted Lord of the Rings paraphernalia. The book she's doodling in contains sketches of celebrated locations such as the Green Dragon pub in Bywater, and there are drawings of dolls, Hobbit-holes and onions. Take a peek!

The CMA blocked the deal in April this year over concerns that it would "alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market", and might lead "to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come". Microsoft attempted to woo the regulator by agreeing to sell Activision Blizzard game cloud streaming rights to Ubisoft, and while the CMA have "limited residual concerns", they've largely accepted Microsoft's modifications.

Alas, it comes too late for the Wood Elf Druid I rolled during my first try at the 1.0 version. I wanted her to look like a sort of Kung Fu Galadriel, with cool tattoos and aerodynamic scars, but she emerged from the character creator looking like she'd been mugged by a packet of demon crayons. I've left my active character, a High Elf Sorceress, safely tattoo-less.

That love has only been amplified by having a kid whose first instinct in any game is to create his own character, unit, level - whatever is available.

The best creative games inspire that creativity by having some innate flavour of their own, though. Some personality that inspires you to lean in, or nudge it in some other direction. By comparison, the new trailer for Everywhere, seems like metaversal porridge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Octopath Traveler II is one of the year’s most celebrated RPGs, and now Xbox fans have been invited to join the party. The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.
The RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. 
In our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices in less than two months on November 16. This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. 
In the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. 
Check out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. 
Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. 
While waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the biggest games of the year, but it launched with its fair share of bugs. Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed "to ensure thorough testing." This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.
While we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. 
With Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!

Even though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.]]></summary>

Announced in September, The Man Who Erased His Name stars longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and focuses on his life after Yakuza 6: The Song of Life before he appears in Infinite Wealth. And now, thanks to Xbox's 2023 Tokyo Game Show broadcast, we know we'll be hanging with Kiryu on Xbox Game Pass on the game's November 9 launch day.
The Man Who Erased His Name will also hit Windows PC as part of Xbox's PC Game Pass program on day one as well. 
Alongside this news, RGG Studio revealed that Like A Dragon: Ishin!, a Yakuza spin-off entry that hit PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2013 in Japan (but never came to the West), will hit Game Pass later this year on both Xbox and Windows PC. 
While waiting for these games to hit Game Pass, read Game Informer's Like A Dragon: Ishin! review and then check out the latest Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth trailer. After that, read our hands-on preview of Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.

How Did Rebirth's Development Compare To Remake's? 
Rebirth launches on February 29, a couple of months shy of Remake’s fourth anniversary. According to Hamaguchi, Remake’s development cycle was around four years, making the turnaround for Rebirth, a much larger game, seem relatively quick.

Final Fantasy VII Remake felt like the realization of an impossible dream when it launched in 2020.

Tack on a good story expansion with the Yuffie-focused Intermission, and the series is riding a wave of momentum into its second chapter, Rebirth. To learn how the sequel is shaping up, I visited Square Enix’s Los Angeles studio to play two slices of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: a flashback sequence of the ill-fated Mt.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.
