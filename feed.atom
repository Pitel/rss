        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley's Star Path duties are full of riddles to make things more challenging. One task you'll encounter during seasons like the Dapper Delights Star Path is giving gifts and chatting with a stargazing wayfinder. However, knowing exactly who this is requires a bit of movie knowledge.


Who is the stargazing wayfinder in Disney Dreamlight Valley?


If you want to chat or give gifts to a stargazing Wayfinder, look no further than Moana. In the Disney universe, Moana is a Wayfinder who follows the stars as a compass when navigating her ship, which is where this nickname comes from.

Depending on the Star Path and tasks you find, you may have to give Moana some gifts, strike up a conversation, or hang out with her. Most character-related objectives take around two real-world days to complete, so be sure to keep an eye on your tasks and how many items, chats, or minutes you need.


One example you might encounter is giving Moana or a "stargazing wayfinder" four gifts. Since you can only give three favorite gifts daily, you'll need another day for the last gift before completing the task. Similarly, you can only have one daily conversation, so expect to hop back in another day if an objective requires several.


Once you complete the task, you can redeem your Star Path points through the events menu. You can use them from here to claim prizes on the rewards screen. The exact points you receive will depend on the Star Path, but it's usually between 20-30.

I would never had imagined Foderingham as the potential candidate for getting such a big boost as part of the FUTTIES promo. But it is what it is, and thankfully, getting the card is really easy. Since it's part of an SBC, there's no need to open any packs or ride your luck. As long as you finish the special challenge before it expires, you can add the card to your squad. 


EA FC 24 Wes Foderingham FUTTIES SBC tasks


The Wes Foderingham FUTTIES SBC has just a single task to complete. The conditions are also pretty straightforward. 


Task 1 - Wes Foderingham



Min. 1 Players from: Premier League


Min. Team Rating: 85

Here's the solution of completing the solo task of Wes Foderingham FUTTIES SBC.

A 99-rated card for a 85-rated squad - you won't find a better deal in EA FC 24's Ultimate Team. With so much surplus fodder lying in our clubs, it's worth completing  this SBC for the fun of it. Maybe he won't be really meta inside the game - he's not the tallest of the lot. But it's the last season, and it's all about having fun across all the game modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld has teamed up with Twitch as part of the Summer of Rewards event, offering three brand new Pal Skins for players on Steam. They’re bizarrely adorable cosmetics, and they’re relatively easy to get, but only as long as you play through Steam. 


This is proving to be something of a sticking point for players who play Palworld on Xbox, and honestly, I can see why. I wouldn’t have known that these drops were exclusive to Steam players from Palworld’s social media posts alone, as it’s not explicitly stated anywhere. I only figured it out for myself when I was asked to link my Twitch and Steam accounts through the Palworld website. 




Comments on social media are filled with Xbox players noting the unfairness of the whole situation, and I can’t say I blame them. Many players are missing out on unique Pal Skins because they play on the "wrong" platform. These are the first Pal Skins to drop outside of the single existing one, Cattiva Sunglasses, which was added as part of the Sakurajima update, and they're not available to everybody.


Palworld isn’t the only game giving items away in the Summer of Rewards event. Many other games give in-game items in return for watching streamers play. However, as far as I can tell, Palworld is the only one limiting their drops in this fashion. 


Cult of the Lamb, which is also part of the Summer of Rewards, is also giving exclusive items to Steam players, but there’s a huge difference: The items are only exclusive to the single platform for now. The Goat-themed items are being given to Steam players as a sort of Early Access and will be coming to players on all other platforms at a later date. 


There have been no such reassurances from Pocketpair that players on any platform other than Steam can get the Pal Skins, and therein lies the problem. Here's hoping that Pal Skins, or any other potential future Twitch drops, are more inclusive of players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 Season 12 has finally commenced and it brings several new things to the table. This includes brand-new maps, a game mode, a Support Hero, and a lot of premium skins.


To celebrate the launch of Season 12, Blizzard Entertainment has added several Overwatch 2 Twitch drops for players to claim. One of them is an epic skin for Sojourn, and here's how you can get it.


How to unlock Sojourn's Barista skin in Overwatch 2


You need to watch a drop-enabled Overwatch 2 livestream on Twitch for 15 hours to unlock Sojourn's Epic Barista skin in Overwatch 2.


Yes, the watch duration of this cosmetic is on the bigger side, but you are getting a skin at no extra cost. You won't need to keep the livestreams open for 15 hours straight, though.


Screenshot by Destructoid


This campaign started on August 20 and ends on August 31, 2024. This means you are getting 11 days in total to claim all the rewards from the Twitch drop event. You can watch your favorite Overwatch 2 streamer for smaller intervals over these 11 days and you'll have the skin unlocked directly to your account.


Make sure you've linked your Blizzard and Twitch accounts together. Once the criteria are met, simply click on the Claim button to get it directly into your account. There are five other rewards to claim from this event, so watching for 15 hours also unlocks them all.


Here are all the rewards you get from the Overwatch 2 Season 12 Twitch drop event:



Watch for 2 hours: Get Antlers Spray


Watch for 4 hours: Get Coffee Player Icon


Watch for 6 hours: Get Sojourn Usual Voice Line


Watch for 9 hours: Get Epic Latte Weapon Charm


Watch for 12 hours: Get Fresh Brewed Victory Pose


Watch for 15 hours: Get Epic Sojourn Barista Skin

The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom".

The onset of a new Valorant Act always results in a shift in the meta, and this will be no different this time around. Episode 9 Act 2 will bring a new Agent, which means we will likely get to see a change in team compositions and new strategies unveiled at VCT next year.

Valorant Episode 9 Act 2 start date and time


Valorant Episode 9 Act 2 will commence on Tuesday, August 27, 2024 at 5 p.m. ET / 10 p.m. BST / 2 p.m. PT. Before that, the servers will undergo maintenance for a smooth transition into the new season.


What new content will Episode 9 Act 2 bring?


For starters, we will be getting to see a brand-new character joining the roster, Agent 26. Right now, we don't have the exact details of what role or abilities they'll have. Riot will reveal more during the end stages of Valorant Champions in South Korea.


Like all previous Acts, Episode 9 Act 2 will kick off with a fresh Battle Pass and a premium skin line. Remember that, starting with patch 9 (Episode 9 Act 1), Riot made it a rule that the Battle Pass and the premium skin line would be released one and two days after the new season starts.


Shortly after that, all the offseason tournaments for different regions will start following. Riot has an extensive plan, with both returning and new events to keep the rest of this year filled with non-stop action.

I recently got to play a preview of the free-to-play Splitgate 2. After six hours, it's clear to me that developer 1047 Games is trying things a bit differently than expected. The original shooter was celebrated as "Halo meets Portal," introducing portal gameplay to arena-style shooting. It worked, and Splitgate exploded in popularity.

To complete the A Fine Vintage challenge in Hitman WoA, you must kill the two targets in Mendoza, Don Archibald Yates and Tamara Vidal, using a fiber wire melee weapon. Following those successful kills, you must escape the location using the boat exit and do it all without ever changing your disguise. Fellow Hitman WoA fans will already know roughly what they must do to pull this off, but I've got a route that makes light work of it. So you can sit back and relax as you wait for your targets to come to you.

Although absent from the patch notes entirely, you too can bask in the glory of these revolutionarily mixed hue dyes right now from the game's Wardrobe. Take a look at each below:


Fire Glass


Sunset


Bone


Coral








They're... fine. They're fine! I'm actually really partial to the "Bone" coloration. But they're also a bit random. Maybe they're somehow related to Vessel of Hatred's theme and I'm just not enough of a connoisseur to see how. What I do know is that if we got these four, we're definitely going to be getting more. Add in the fact that they were included as part of a free update and not a premium purchase and I'm a happy Wanderer.  


With the Gamescom showcase giving us new details on Vessel of Hatred, including upcoming co-op, "raid" style content in the form of the Dark Citadel, Diablo 4 is primed to enter the next phase of its live-service existence. The community is being heard more than ever (a trend Blizzard's other games are also enjoying) and endgame is looking stronger than ever. That's all to say: updates, content, and quality of life are nice and all, but please, give me some more armor colors, too.

This job is easier said than done, even if you select one of the stronger teams. If you, like me, love to play as an underdog, the task gets a lot harder. But the addition of a stiff challenge certainly adds to the fun element. In this guide, I explore ten great save ideas you can enjoy in Franchise mode solo, or with friends.


Top 10 Franchise mode teams to pick in Madden NFL 25


When I say top 10, I don't necessarily mean the 10 best lineups. After all, the word fun has a subjective value for all of us. Battering opponents like the Kansas City Chiefs might be entertaining for some, while another player might want to go on my underdog ride. Keepi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the key things about Skyrim – indeed, about thousands of games – is getting to live out the life of a capable hero. All that questing sure goes a long way to maxing out your skills while you explore vast worlds. But what if – hear me out – someone else could do it for you?


Say hello to Skyrim Outbound Shipments by user Eudalus, a mod for TES5 that allows you to employ the help of a, shall we say, lesser person to carry out certain duties. Namely, by finishing quests for a small fee. After all, the Dragonborn has more important things to be getting on with. Romancing Lydia, for example.


Image via Eudalus/Nexus Mods.


Why carry that important item all the way back to whoever sent you out for it when you can pay a courier to do it in your stead? What this mod does, essentially, is let you hire an NPC to "progress or complete quests by delivering quest items or messages for you."


You'll still reap the benefits


Of course, you'll still get the rewards and possibly the kudos as well. According to the mod's description, any monetary remuneration you're owed for the quest will be delivered to you by the courier within six to 36 hours.


There are a couple of price tiers, though, depending on what you want the hired help to achieve. Eudalus says most jobs will fall under "normal delivery," which costs 10 gold coins by default. For more complex quests, you'll pay "hazard delivery," which is three times the normal rate, but does include hiring the courier to trek dangerous territory, such as Castle Volkihar.


The mod is still being worked on, so there may be a few issues with compatibility when it comes to others that you may have installed. Also, not all the quests are supported, such as ones that reward skill points, but it looks like Eudalus is going to keep working on it.

        <updated>2024-08-22T15:19:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With potential to be a very promising indie horror game, Post Trauma intends to keep the classic tropes of the genre alive and well. With twisted visuals not unlike what we know from Silent Hill, this tasty looking title will be grossing out our consoles and PCs this October.


October 29, to be precise. As always when it comes to horror gaming, the Halloween period is typically a busy time for both AAA and more independent studios. This is definitely one to look out for when it releases via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.




Wearing its influences very much on its sleeves, Post Trauma sees you play as Roman, a  "middle-aged train conductor trapped in a terrifying twisted reality." The trailer above is quite the nightmare fuel, combining combat with "unspeakable horrors that lurk in these threatening surroundings."


Pre-trauma


The game's been in development for a few years now. I actually got to play a very early demo a while back, and I was wholly impressed with what I saw. Even back then, it was quite the visual feast, which was unfortunately a burden for my poor laptop. That's my laptop's fault, though, not the game's.


It's great that indie horror is still thriving in this increasingly hostile and competitive industry. Of course, there's always going to be some overshadowing from the likes of Resident Evil, not to mention the upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2 (with recent previews suggesting the game may be worth the wait after all).


The smaller teams who are in it for the passion and are still making waves in the genre. I mean, you could say that about other genres as well. Independent studios are the ball bearings in the video game jar that's full to the brim with the golf balls of the mainstream industry. God, that was a weird thing to say.

It allows players to take Animal Crossing with them literally in their pocket, constantly updating and evolving with new events and things to do. 


Sadly, Nintendo announced today that Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp will be shutting down on November 29.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second premium expansion for Risk of Rain 2 launches on August 27, and that's also when we can expect the console upgrades. Gearbox Publishing and Hopoo Games locked in that very same date for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, which come with new platform-specific features.


Among those features are split-screen couch co-op, as well as options for 1440p/1080p resolutions at 60 frames per second and 4K resolution at 30 frames per second. Those who pick up the PS5 version can also look forward to the usual audio-visual bells and whistles courtesy of the DualSense controller.


If you already have the PS4 and/or Xbox One versions of Risk of Rain 2, the current-gen versions will be available as a free upgrade. Check out a trailer below, followed by another look at the new Seekers of the Storm DLC.




The Seekers of the Storm DLC will be $14.99 when it launches. The announcements came with a reveal of the second of three new survivors: Chef. As the description details, a huge roller has been put in place of the earlier Chef's long legs, making it easier to steamroll any Lemurians that get in its way. It can slice, it can dice, and its mustache looks nice. 


You can see more in the Chef showcase trailer:




There's also a dev diary that cuts a little deeper into the new addition:

To start the quest, you'll need to speak with the Postmutt. You can find him atop the Postmutt Inc. tower on the eastern side of the main Purvanna island. At the foot of the tower is a large, silver chest. Sadly, your pirate-like harassment won't convince the pooch to hand over the goods.

And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there?

Even almost 14 years after it was first released, it still hasn’t really set in that Deus Ex creator Warren Spector’s first game after a six-year break was not only a Mickey Mouse platformer, but one exclusively made for the Nintendo Wii after years of being a PC-only developer. To make matters even wilder, it was a pseudo-edgy re-imagining of decades of Disney iconography with forgotten mascot Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as a central antagonist.
And yet Epic Mickey happened, and what’s perhaps even more unbelievable, given the complications of re-releasing licensed games, is that 14 years on we’d be getting a remade version of the game. But, following the remake of the certified banger Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, Purple Lamp is taking the helm of an updated edition of Mickey Mouse’s Wii adventure.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Tripwire Interactive and Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen have revealed The Stone of Madness, a new tactical stealth adventure for Switch set in 18th century Spain.
Launching early 2025, the game focuses on the lives of 'five forsaken inmates', who must work together to escape the confines of a monastery that is said to be both a prison and a madhouse. United to overcome corruption, violence, and the threat of their own fears, the five characters will need to solve puzzles, obtain clues, and work to maintain their sanity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've yet to discover a SteamWorld game I don't like. Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

Publisher Twin Sails Interactive popped up at last night's Future Games Show to reveal that the gorgeous Persona-inspired turn-based JRPG Bloomtown: A Different Story will be adventuring onto Switch on 24th September.
Developed by Lazy Bear Games and Different Sense Games, Bloomtown looks like a perfectly cosy affair on the surface. You get to explore a slice of 1960s Americana, make friends, do a light bit of farming — it's all very sweet. But there's a darker side to the idyllic Bloomtown (literally), with a world of demons and other nasties growing beneath the surface, snatching the town's children.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

We know that the 'Switch 2' is real. We know an announcement is coming this fiscal year. We know "Switch successor" is the most accurate description of it. All of the other big details — what form it will take, how big it will be, whether it will finally give us that flipping Wind Waker port — are all up to speculation and analysis for the time being.
Take, perhaps, one of the biggest questions of them all: How much will 'Switch 2' cost? In the absence of an official announcement, we still have no idea, but that hasn't stopped certain analysts from throwing out predictions and it won't stop us from looking to the past to try and determine the future.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

Grinding Gear Games have been set on a November window for a while now, but this is the first time they’ve nailed down a date, and possibly clicked on it a bunch of times to show how serious they are. Do a game related verb I can’t accurately name because I never played past that beach at the beginning of the first game, and do it in the general direction of the trailer below. Watch it. Just watch it.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

Turns out the "megapocalypse" was an unhealthy combination of "every worst-case apocalyptic scenario imaginable". Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best roguelikes on PC is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

Mojang's official account for reporting service status updates noted that "intermittent failures or slowdowns" began on August 13th, and despite similarly intermittent reports of uptime in the days since, the servers remain inaccessible to most players today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NVIDIA sits front and center of the AI boom. The company provides the much-needed chips and offers its own AI models. NVIDIA admittedly used pirated books to train these models, which triggered a copyright infringement lawsuit. This week, the company informed the court that these claims fall flat, arguing that copyrighted books are nothing more than statistical correlations to its AI models.

Though I did visit a cat cafe recently, and I got to boop some sphinx kittens on the nose. Life pretty much peaked then, so I'm in a bit of a slump right now. So do me a favour and sound off even more than usual about what your fur babies have been up to lately! And also, if you feel like it, let us know what you're playing this weekend too.

The complaint followed the familiar 'repeat infringer' format, with damages for works in suit worth over a billion dollars and everything on the line. A joint filing this week reveals that the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice, never to see the light of day again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baroque wilderness-builder Nightingale has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn described the launch early access version as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable RPGs, from Baldur's Gate to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 


Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel.

Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

And, as of September, they’re cracking down on links to other websites in store pages. Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will. I like it!

Whether both will actually see the inside of a cell is unclear; one turned up to face the music, the other failed to appear. The reason for his absence is unknown and just the start of a long list of other unanswered questions.

Will the realism-obsessed driving sims take the lead with their sublime physics engines? Might the futuristic combat racers simply destroy the opposition with explosive rockets? Or perhaps a nippy arcade crowd-pleaser will soar to the finish line, propelled by the sound of roaring cheers. It's all to play for here at our incredibly messed-up grand prix with a worrying lack of rules or regulation.

If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game.

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

Games like Maelstrom, Ambrosia's Macintosh clone of Asteroids, and the proto-shmup Crystal Quest from Patrick Buckland, who would go on to make Carmageddon. Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

They can’t hurt you. They’re actually known for not being able to move.

Ah, the press release speaketh! Probably should have read some more before I began exclaiming “Chaos Gremlins!” over and over. Have an announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Those 90s cowards. Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The "Crush Depth" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

As presented on the Paris Judicial Court's website, the list of domains amounts to a wall of merged text simply asking to be misinterpreted. Fortunately they're more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn't mean precision blocking won't be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."
