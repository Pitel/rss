Plus, for those who haven't played Dungeons & Dragons or even a CRPG like this in a while, there's a lot to familiarize yourself with. You might need some tips.
While I wouldn't call myself a D&D 5E expert, I've followed the Early Access of Baldur's Gate 3 for a while and, at the time of this writing, put a solid chunk of hours into the launch state of BG3. It's a massive, complex game with a lot of interlocking systems and little quality-of-life tips that, even if you are told them once, you might forget ten hours down the road. Well, that's why I'm here.

I’m not sure what I expected from The Coin Game, but it certainly wasn’t what I got. On the surface, it looks like a simulator for those horrible games in malls and bowling alleys. The ones that are barely games and dangle amazing prizes are just out of reach. However, that’s not what The Coin Game is about.
The real concept of The Coin Game is that you’re trapped in the simulation of a rural town, and your only means of coping with your nightmarish existence is to gamble for cheap prizes. It is absolutely Diminishing Returns: The Game. And I love it. Above all, I think it’s exactly what I need right now.

Searching for it won't do any good either, proving that the Last of Us clone has all but been erased.

SCS Software, by comparison, have become masters at capturing the essence of places of no significance.

The latest example: Oklahoma, now available in ATS's latest DLC. Watch the launch trailer below and see if it doesn't make you want to take a road trip.

Whether you're on Xbox or PC, there are a bunch of classic titles that are being discounted. You can either head over to the Xbox store or GOG.com and peruse the games that are currently on offer, with some slashed by up to 85%.
[caption id="attachment_394928" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Screenshot via Destructoid[/caption]
You'll notice there's a smorgasbord to choose from, whether you want something a bit more contemporary, like Hi-Fi Rush or Deathloop, or something a bit older but still popular, like Skyrim or the Dishonored games.
Back to (old) school
However, many of you will be drawn to the plethora of legendary, old-school games that are also in the sale. For example, you can take things back to Bethesda days of yore by picking up the first two Elder Scrolls game for free. Even Morrowind (the third entry in the series) is going dirt cheap.
If retro shooters are your thing, the first four Quake games are on offer, while Wolfenstein 3D is a staggering 70% off. Of course, you can't talk classic FPS without mentioning Doom and, yep, they're currently discounted as well.
For those who don't know, QuakeCon is an annual game convention that began in 1996. Originally a way for people to celebrate the early Quake and Doom releases, the event has since ballooned into something bigger.
This year will see QuakeCon 2023 return to in-person after being a digital-only convention for the past three years. The event runs from August 10 to August 13, and will be held at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A stick is for life.
Stick to the Plan is a puzzle game about dogs, sticks, and big plans. The upcoming tile-based puzzler is coming to Steam on 12th September, with a Switch release date "yet to be determined", says publisher and developer Dead Pixel Tales.
As you can no doubt guess, you play as a stick-loving dog named Roberto — and he really, really, likes sticks. He wants to find the best sticks ever, and you'll need to help guide him through 60 different levels. The controls are very simple — you just need to move, rotate, and pick up and drop the stick in order to show Roberto the way. But with hazards along the way, you'll need to be careful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pyramid Head, the main antagonist from the iconic Silent Hill 2, is not exactly what you would call "cute." However, there's always room for some adorableness, even in horror, and there's a plush toy of the monster that's being made available next year.
After the Credits, a company that specializes in video game and pop culture memorabilia, recently uploaded an image of the loveable-looking Pyramid Head. Despite the fact it still resembles the Silent Hill 2 villain, you can't help but coo at him in this context.
https://twitter.com/atc_experience/status/1686678228616859648
While the plush isn't available until January 4, 2024, you can pre-order one from the website, currently priced at €34.99 (about $38 US).
No sign of a James Sunderland plush, though
Of course, what a lot of you are waiting for–besides soft toy versions of demonic creatures–is the Silent Hill 2 remake. Helmed by Layers of Fear and The Medium studio, Bloober Team, there's a lot riding on whether a modern telling of this classic horror game will be a success.
The original 2001 release is such an influential part of the genre that any studio handling a remake will be up against a lot of pressure.
We're still not sure when it's coming out, though an Australian retailer did suggest it's due to release on September 29. Neither Konami nor the developer have confirmed this, so we can't say for certain whether this launch window is accurate.
All we know is there's plenty of Silent Hill 2 fans who are unsure whether Bloober has what it takes to do the source material justice. If not, at least there's the adorable version of Pyramid Head to ease the pain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Two Point Studios have finally announced the next add-on for 2022’s Two Point Campus. I believed they’d do this eventually, but it’s Two Point Campus: Medical School. It’s coming August 17th to all platforms.
I was just wondering when we’d get the next piece of DLC. We last got School Spirits back in March, and we just passed the anniversary for the base game, so I figured we were due. I was actually digging through a few press sites to see if I could get a hint on whether something was coming, but Sega knows how to keep a surprise.
https://youtu.be/qKCnO3RNYws
As the name implies, Medical School will have you training up your hapless puppet students in the ways of healing. Like the Space Academy DLC, this one comes with three new levels to tackle. There are six new types of rooms, and many of the courses seem to offer some furniture ripped straight from Two Point Hospital. Alongside the new content, there’s also an array of fresh challenges to tackle in this DLC.
Two Point Campus was one of my favorite releases from 2022, and I’ve been hungrily eating up all the DLC as it gets released. This one will definitely be no different. The release schedule so far has given me just enough time to recharge and be ready to dive back in. Personally, though, I’m hoping there’s new radio DJ segments dropping with this pack.
Two Point Campus is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Medical School DLC will be dropping on August 17th for $9.99 USD.

Also, an update to Ranked will slow the pace to Masters for the average player, allowing for more accurate matchmaking. As such, there will mostly be changes in climbing the ranks after Diamond.

Myriads Colon Renaissance is not quite the break from the 4X that I'd tried to get us, but it is a hybrid.

It's one of my favourite games, and I went into 2011's Portal 2 with many a reservation. But it's very good! And there are so many things I love about Portal 2 that it's quite hard to pick just one thing to write about.
I could do "the joy of Portal 2's retro science", where you fall through the floor into the old school Aperture Science labs and see the 60s-ish version of all the big buttons and testing chambers you were put through in the first Portal. I could do "the joy of the corrupted personality cores in Portal 2", a group of corrupted AI spheres including Rick The Adventure Sphere, which is largely just Nolan North making up his own action theme song. I could even do "the joy of potatoes in Portal 2". And then I realised that most of the things I like about Portal 2 also intersect with Stephen Merchant's character Wheatley, a weird little guy (in the most pejorative sense).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's always been quite a disconnect between Revenant's reputation and his abilities in Apex Legends. All the cinematics we get of this infamous, terrifying murder-bot show him single-mindedly pursuing his targets, scuttling along walls, and wiping out enemies at close range like a cybernetic John Wick. But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.
Season 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities. And guys, I think they might have gone a bit too far making him scary again. I think he might be overpowered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Baldur's Gate 3 finally out of early access, I'm sure many of you will be busy creating your own custom characters right now as you begin your journey through Larian's RPG epic. But I implore you to take a moment to remember the great Losiir, a Githyanki soldier who most of you will probably never meet. That's because he only shows up if you pick Lae'zel as your origin character, because who else would be there to do her fancy sword lunge from above if not a gender-swapped version of basically herself? But he's a good egg, Losiir, even if his run-time as an official Baldur's Gate companion is, err, somewhat short-lived.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.
It’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. 
A spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: 
“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”
Striking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. 
The Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 is launching with a relatively clean bill of technical health, so long as you’re playing it on an honest to goodness Windows PC. Larian Studios’ RPG also happens to have earned Valve’s Playable rating for Steam Deck compatibility, which usually signals a game that’s most fine on the SteamOS handheld – it might just have some small text, or no 16:10 display support. 
That Playable certification will have been granted off its early access performance, and now that I’ve wandered around the review build for a few hours, I can confirm that playable it most certainly is, with some especially smart control tweaks to accommodate a lack of mouse and keyboard. Actually getting to that point, however, was a minor nightmare, plagued by hard crashes that took one of the Steam Deck’s most obscure tools to fix. As such, before we get into how Baldur’s Gate 3 runs on the Steam Deck or which settings you should use for it, I hope you’ll afford me a rant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to Baldur's Gate 3 leaving early access, developers Larian Studios have understandably put a lot of emphasis on the game's custom character creation, what with it being much more firmly ingrained in the world of Dungeons & Dragons and role-playing more generally than, say, their previous Divinity games. But before you jump into creating your favourite D&D build, do take a moment to watch the Introductions for each of its fixed origin characters, too. They're great fun, well-written and have some good jokes in them, but they also reveal some important details about your companions-to-be that you might not have gleaned otherwise. They're also very easy to miss if you're not careful.

And I'm here to tell you that, especially if you're a returning Early Access player, you shouldn't just blitz through the whole starting area right away.
I've had a little bit of time, roughly a few days, to play the launch version of Baldur's Gate 3. It's nowhere near enough to write a full review—that will arrive much later, after I've sunk the requisite dozens of hours into seeing this journey through. For the most part, I've largely been retreading similar paths to what I played in the Early Access, dealing with the simmering tension around the Druid grove, tiefling refugees, and nearby goblin camp.

Larian Studios' take on the classic Dungeons & Dragons series sees two role-playing giants collide, with all the entwined legacy and carryover you might expect. But in its early hours, what's impressing me most is how Larian keeps the party moving towards goals, both grandiose and small.
I've only had a few days with the launch version of Baldur's Gate 3, so this isn't comprehensive by any means. I'm writing this after just having retread Act 1, the same area that was in the Early Access but feels noticeably different in launch. I've got more on that in a write-up here, that's also angled a bit more towards returning players.

In case you missed it, the Nintendo Switch has now sold over 129 million units as of June 30th, 2023. That's frankly astonishing and it puts the console ever closer to reaching the lifetime sales of not only the Nintendo DS but Sony's PlayStation 2.
Can it really reach those lofty milestones, though? Let's remind ourselves of the figures first. The DS is sitting at 154.02 million units, while the PlayStation 2 is at 155 million, which means the Switch will need to sell around 26 million units in order to become the highest-selling console of all time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The distance from the roof of the Counting House to the nearest building in Baldur’s Gate is vast, by design. The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.
Upon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portal 2 is obviously brilliant, in part because each of its chapters possesses a distinct charm. GLaDOS’ return, for instance, is a stretch of pure puzzling with just a dash of dread, while your first steps into the abandoned 1960s Aperture facility interrupt a fairly hopeless tone with an upbeat sense of discovery. For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision is teasing a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare-related reveal next week. 
This lighthearted tease, which you can see below, hints that the next Call of Duty is another Modern Warfare, even though 2022’s Call of Duty was Modern Warfare II. However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). 
Jokes on you, real key art here.

August 2, 2023
As you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” 
It seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. 
In the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. Check out this story about how Sony signed a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation after that.

It's the one game I'm confident recommending to anyone to folks who play games frequently, but also to those who don't. My biggest triumph was recommending it to my dad, a 62-year-old retired manufacturing manager from Wales, who loved it so much he not only recommended it to a friend (who also loved it) but also said my mum should try it too - and I agree! It’s all subjective of course, but for me, its banger of a story, accessible it is, and how you can practically run it on a potato make it a wonderful gateway into gaming in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo just had one of its best first quarters since the launch of the Switch in 2017, thanks in part to sales of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
The company’s latest financial report reveals that Tears of the Kingdom sold 18.51 million units from its release to June 30. This led to Nintendo having the highest “global sell-through of first-party” for a first quarter since the launch of the Switch. It says sales of Tears of the Kingdom also drove hardware sales, as Nintendo sold 3.91 million units in this quarter, which ran from April 1 to June 30, 2023. 


Nintendo says those 3.91 million units sold translates to unit sales for the entire Switch family of systems rising by 13.9% year-on-year, led primarily by the Switch OLED Model, which contributed 2.83 million of those sales…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Are you tiny Thor, god of tiny hammers?".
Tiny Thor from Asylum Square has been a long time coming. After one of its lead developers came up with a rough cut of its concept in a 48-hour game jam in 2012, its development proceeded in fits and starts for a little over a decade before it finally saw release this past June. Games that spend that long in development hell can be notoriously uneven, but we’re happy to report that Tiny Thor has proven to be worth the wait. This is a tough, gorgeous, and altogether great retro platformer that you ought to consider picking up.
The 16-bit-inspired game follows the adventures of the titular Asgardian warrior during a time long before he was the buff, long-haired hero you all know—the story here opens on his eighth birthday. As a present, Odin gifts him the legendary Mjolnir hammer, which Thor immediately takes to. While he’s out fooling around with his new toy, the boy is approached by a certain mischievous individual, who tricks him into destroying the anchor of the Bifrost, cutting off all of Asgard from Midgard. Joined by his father’s ravens, Tiny Thor thus sets out to repair the damage and prevent Ragnarök from causing the end of the world.

The most recent Nintendo financial report is packed full of sales figures for games and consoles alike, but let's not forget that the Big-N is now in the world of films too. On a note about expanding the company's IP, the report revealed the viewing numbers from The Super Mario Bros. Movie's box office which is estimated (by Universal Pictures) to have pulled in a whopping 168.10 million viewers.
This will likely come as no surprise. The Mario Movie was breaking records straight out of the gate, quickly becoming the highest-grossing video game adaptation after just one week. It has since gone on to become one of the biggest animated movies of all time with a box office taking of $1.349 billion, according to the report — Nintendo describes this as "the second-highest for an animated film" though figures from Box Office Mojo place the 2019's The Lion King and Frozen 2 above it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. 
There are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation.

Nintendo's financial report for the first quarter of FY2024 shows some pretty big numbers for the likes of Tears of the Kingdom and the Switch family of systems as a whole, but another name that has continued to climb in the rankings over the past few months is Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which has pulled in an impressive 22.66 million sales as of 30th June 2023.
This is a clear slowdown from the games' launch — remember, the titles shifted 20 million in the first six weeks alone — but the numbers do move Scarlet and Violet ever closer to breaking into the top three best-selling games in the series.

Nintendo has released its financial results for the first quarter of FY24, providing an updated view of the top ten best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 30th, 2023.
Given that we've already reported on the incredible numbers achieved by The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, it should really come as no surprise to see the sequel make its way into the top ten, bumping Ring Fit Adventure out of the runnings. Not only that, but Super Mario Odyssey has climbed the ranks to come in at number five this time, undoubtedly boosted by the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

As part of its financial report for the first quarter of FY24, Nintendo has once again reconfirmed release dates and windows for its upcoming Switch games.
Compared to what the company had in store back in May '23, the rest of the year is looking a lot healthier, with the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, WarioWare: Move It!, and Super Mario RPG all making their Switch debut. Needless to say, fans will have plenty to sink their teeth into in the coming months.

Nintendo has released its financial results for the first quarter of FY24, providing an updated view of sales figures for its key titles and hardware as of June 30th, 2023.
Something which should really come as no surprise, but is still somehow pretty astonishing, is that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is well and truly selling like hotcakes. In less than two months, the game has sold a total of 18.51 million units. Of course, now that we're in August, that figure is undoubtedly even higher at this point.

One of the most anticipated games coming to the Switch this month is Vampire Survivors - an indie roguelite bullet shooter, where it's your job to survive against multiple waves of enemies by levelling up and unlocking powerful attacks.
While the only versions are for Xbox, PC and mobile devices right now, there's actually another one that's never actually been revealed until now. It's called 'Vampire Survivors - Directer's Cut' and is "drastically different to the base game" according to video game journalist Laura Kate Dale, who was given special access to it, during a media event for the co-op mode.

The developers at Singularity 6 invited me to jump in and take a look at Palia ahead of its closed beta launch today. Excited for the opportunity to make some friends and go fishing, I pounced on the offer.
After a few days of casually exploring and immersing myself in the world of Palia, I've come to the following conclusion: Palia is exactly what it advertises it is. A cozy experience that focuses on the social aspects of playing a community-driven game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released on April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has been a success for Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment, earning both critical and commercial acclaim. Although it originally skipped the last-gen consoles, the EA first-quarter earnings call revealed that Respawn has PS4 and Xbox One ports on the way for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. As the released EA report brief reveals, the company is looking to continue capitalizing on its financially well-performing franchises, including Star Wars Jedi.
[caption id="attachment_375326" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
EA is not done with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor yet
As reported by The Verge, EA CEO Andrew Wilson announced during the earnings call that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will come to PS4 and Xbox One, though a release date wasn't mentioned. This is an unexpected turn of events, as in an interview with PLAY Magazine (as reported by Game Rant) game director Stig Asmussen had previously stated that Jedi: Survivor was skipping last-gen consoles to ensure a "true new-gen experience in the Star Wars universe."
The financial report points to Star Wars Jedi and FIFA as the catalysts for its first-quarter performance. It highlights that in addition to attracting millions of players globally, Jedi: Survivor is also “seeing players spend more time in-game than its predecessor.” FIFA was noted for “delivering a record Q1 for the franchise,” and this comes as the series undergoes massive rebranding following the end of EA’s partnership with FIFA. The next entry in the series will be titled EA Sports FC 24.
Respawn has continually been working on the game since its launch, with patches being released to improve performance on all gaming platforms. Time will tell how developers will manage to ensure smooth performance on the dated last-gen consoles.

Food is one of the many joys of life, and for many, cooking is part of the fun. And as with all everyday activities, cooking has made its way into many a video game.
Whether it's the central mechanic or a big part of character customisation and building, cooking has become a staple not just in the kitchen, but in many Switch titles. Cooking Mama is one of the first big titles to put cooking at the centre of gameplay, but it's also handy for when you need a quick bit of healing while out in the open world of Hyrule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tekken 8 was originally announced in 2022, and a Closed Network Test was recently released on multiple platforms in July. To the dismay of the developers, some gamers have since cracked the CNT to play it in unintended ways. Bandai Namco is warning players against playing Tekken 8's cracked CNT, and those caught could face consequences.
[caption id="attachment_392950" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]
Be patient or risk a ban
Players with the cracked CNT can not only play the game offline, but continue to play it beyond the test period. In a Twitter post, Bandai Namco warned that this violates its Terms of Service and the Tekken World Tour's Code of Conduct.
https://twitter.com/BNEesports/status/1685978121948770305
Unauthorized access to the CNT could result in a ban from the upcoming Tekken World Tour and other official tournaments. In other words, competitive players may want to heed this warning. It is understandable why developers would emphasis this penalty in particular. Those playing the cracked version would have a headstart on practice, which could affect the results of official tournaments.
This isn't the only problem the CNT has caused, as it has also resulted in Tekken 8's partial roster leaking. Though Bandai Namco has officially announced 16 characters, the leak reveals a longer list of playable fighters.
It has certainly been a good time for fighting game fans. Street Fighter 6 launched to critical acclaim in June, and Mortal Kombat 1 will launch on September 19. Bandai Namco has not yet revealed a release date for Tekken 8.

Sonic Superstars takes us back to the 2D era of the franchise, where the gameplay is more straightforward, the story premises are simpler, and the character roster is small.

Sonic Superstars sees the return of Dr. Eggman, as well as Fang the Hunter (previously known as Nack the Weasel and Fang the Sniper) from Sonic Triple Trouble and Sonic the Fighters, but they're not alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crawly Games has announced that their deckbuilder horror game, Draft of Darkness, is leaving Steam Early Access and going full version on August 23, 2023.
If you’ve never heard of Draft of Darkness, just look at it. It’s like if Pit-Fighter had a personality beyond just “oiled beef.” It has grainy, digitized actors fighting with grainy, unspeakable horrors in rusty lo-fi locales. It has just the right mixture of goofy and sleaze that makes it seem like a lost PS1 game from the creators of Chiller. Ugh, I suddenly have the urge to play Loaded.
https://youtu.be/9sZE1xr7wvI
Draft of Darkness was actually billed to me as Slay the Spire meets Resident Evil. It’s an ammo-focused turn-based deckbuilder where you recruit survivors and battle monsters and government robots. It uses a roguelite system. Maps are procedurally generated, and you keep advancing until you’re overwhelmed by the darkness. You gain credits that can buy booster packs after each run, allowing you to build up your arsenal over time.
It also has a “meta-story progression system.” They say, “Every decision can alter the story's outcome and allow for new ways to progress. Different choices are available in each run, but be careful; some will have serious consequences.”
I’ve recently had some success when it comes to clicking with deckbuilders recently, and this looks right up my alley. I mean, 90% of that statement comes from just looking at the visuals. It’s like pixelated poetry to me.
Draft of Darkness is available right now for PC on Steam Early Access. The full version 1.0 will hit on August 23, 2023.

Life sims can be great stress relievers by letting you build a digital life from the ground up at a leisurely pace. However, many of those titles offer freeform experiences where more purpose-driven players may struggle with having to make their own fun. Palia aims to satisfy both crowds by tossing dozens of players into a fleshed-out fantasy world to build a life while also embarking on an epic quest. I made a new life for myself within developer Singularity 6’s upcoming free-to-play life sim MMO. While much of it feels familiar, the promise of building a home alongside friends while unraveling a central mystery is enticing for the genre.

This 12-core 3D V-Cache processor sits in the middle of the 8-core Ryzen 7 7800X3D (that ranks as the fastest gaming processor) and the 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X3D (that combines excellent gaming and content creation performance). 
However, being overshadowed by your siblings is no bad thing, as the 7900X3D has fallen significantly further in price, bringing it back into contention for users that want a lot of cores for content creation tasks and excellent gaming performance. It launched at $600 and now retails for $510, but today on Ebay you can get this processor for just $439 - an amazing price. You even get a free copy of Starfield in the bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like Starfield will be taking advantage of the Xbox Play Anywhere feature. Through this, owners of Starfield will be able to swap between Xbox Series X|S and PC, without having to buy copies of the game for both systems.
That update was noticed by the Starfield Beyond Twitter account, a profile that (as the name heavily implies) chronicles all things related to Bethesda's upcoming space epic. The Starfield store page does currently have the tag.
https://twitter.com/starfieldbeyond/status/1686137526010908673?
To infinity, and – wait, wrong franchise
For those who don't know, Play Anywhere lets you own a game on Xbox and Windows-based PCs at no additional cost. This also means your saves will carry over between systems, so you could literally start playing on one and smoothly transition to the other without any fuss.
With Starfield offering the Xbox Play Anywhere feature, it pretty much means you can have two copies of the game with one purchase. Maybe not everyone will benefit from being able to switch playing "Skyrim in space" between console and PC, but it's a neat little bonus if you're into that sort of thing.
I think it's safe to say we're pretty much ready for Starfield now. We've had everything from the game's PC specs to a 1,000-page compendium outlining as much info as possible. Seems like all that's left is for the game to launch. And it's not far off either. Starfield will touch down on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 6, 2023.

        <updated>2023-08-02T16:00:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is getting a limited Collector's Edition. A post over on THQ's website says there's only going to be 5,000 of these made worldwide, so you might want to get in quick if you want one.
The Collector's Edition will feature a fair amount of bonus material, including both a statue and miniature, a steelbook case for the game, some DLC (which includes the Derceto 1992 costume pack), and more. You can check out the trailer for this special edition below.

Return to the dark
We all know that Resident Evil is one of the most influential survival horror series of all time. However, Alone in the Dark actually predates Capcom's legendary franchise by four years.
The first Alone in the Dark game set the scene for the genre and while it's massively dated now, it's been cemented in gaming history as a landmark part of horror. Sadly, subsequent releases and attempts at reboots haven't had much of an impact, being overshadowed by other games that have come after it.
However, Alone in the Dark is making another comeback. A recent video uploaded to publisher THQ Nordic's YouTube page gives a brief teaser of the upcoming title, which is being developed by Magicka 2 studio Pieces Interactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtrvT7aDL1s
While previous attempts at bringing Alone in the Dark into the modern world have not gone down well, horror fans will still be looking forward to this entry.
With Killing Eve's Jodie Comer and Stranger Things' David Harbour on board (not to mention a story crafted by Amnesia and SOMA writer Mikael Hedberg), there's enough intrigue here to hopefully give the iconic horror series another crack at video game modernity.
Alone in the Dark is due for release on October 25, and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We don't go to Ravenholm…" Half-Life 2's sixth chapter heading warns, and when you arrive at the outskirts of this abandoned mining town, you immediately see why. This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. 
But I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: "We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun." This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be.

Daedalic published an extensive list of changes for the PC version on the Gollum Steam page. It’s unclear if any of these changes are coming to the game’s console versions, but Game Informer reached out to Daedalic to ask and will update this story if it hears back. As for the PC patch, it includes changes that fix issues with quest markers disappearing, interactable objects becoming non-interactable, checkpoint system bugs, and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight is one of those games that wears its horror influences on its sleeve. We've already seen Behaviour Interactive's asymmetrical survival game crossover with franchises like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. We've also recently been treated to Nicolas Cage, so anything's possible with this game. Now, it's the Alien franchise's turn to get the Dead by Daylight collaboration treatment.
A recent teaser over on the official YouTube channel shows that the Xenomorph will be coming to Dead by Daylight. No date on when this will actually be happening has been announced, but the short clip says we can "learn more on August 8."
https://youtu.be/8h6BLFUkbeM
Suffice it to say, if you're a fan of Dead by Daylight and of the Alien films (or at least two of them), then this update is going to be right up your dark and dingy corridor.
In space, no one can hear you crank a generator
Since releasing in 2016, Dead by Daylight has become a force to be reckoned with in the horror community. If you haven't had a chance to play it, essentially the game involves four players trying to survive against one player who takes on the role of the killer on a murderous rampage.
Some notable villains and survivors from the world of horror have been implemented over the years, including Ghost Face from the Scream franchise, Evil Dead's Ash, and even the creepy girl from The Ring.
The game became so popular that a Dead by Daylight movie adaptation is currently in the pipeline from famed production company Blumhouse. We all know that video games being translated to the big screen isn't always the best move.
However, it could be interesting to see how a co-operative multiplayer game featuring a ton of classic horror monsters will work on film. And, of course, there's the aforementioned Alien crossover to look forward to as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but I've been immensely enjoying the seeming renaissance of tower defence citybuilding games recently. The grimdark horrors of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand might be a bit too hard as nails for my personal liking, but there's something about the act of building up my little settlements and defending them against ever-larger nightly hordes that just unlocks something in my brain that says, 'Yes, more of this, please'. It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. 
Thronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gunfire Games' Remnant 2 has been making waves since it launched on July 25. The tough co-op shooter wears its FromSoftware influence on its sleeve, which has resonated with fans and critics alike. The developers have revealed that Remnant 2 has already sold over a million copies, exceeding the first game's launch sales by a considerable amount.

Remnant 2 soars to the top of the charts
When Remnant: From the Ashes hit shelves in 2019, it took two months before it sold over a million copies. As Gunfire Games has announced, the sequel achieved this feat in just four days. Yoon Im of Gearbox Publishing stated that "Remnant 2 exceeded our expectations. As a commercial and critical hit, we’re incredibly proud of the Gunfire team and everyone here at Gearbox Publishing who brought this title to life."
There were early signs that Remnant 2 was gearing up for an explosive launch. Before its release, it had claimed the top spot on Steam's best-seller list, overtaking trending titles like Starfield and BattleBit Remastered. It currently sits in third place, surpassed only by Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Baldur's Gate 3. When it was finally released, it doubled the number of concurrent players its predecessor had at launch.
The high sales numbers have been accompanied by plenty of critical acclaim, with our own Steven Mills scoring it an impressive 8.5. And with its numerous secrets, we'll likely talk about this one for some time still.
Remnant 2 is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Don’t get me wrong, I'm very much a Short King myself, but I assumed the gas mask-wearing enforcers of City 17 would be more vertically intimidating. As I defiantly refuse to pick up litter in Half-Life 2’s opening sequence, I find the approaching officer and his raised electric baton to be weirdly adorable. Until he hits me, of course. The resulting crack gives me such a fright that I fling my arms out and smack my hand against the corner of a bookcase.
This has been my experience of playing the first few hours of Half-Life 2’s excellent fan-made VR mod, a completely free add-on that transforms Valve’s 2004 masterpiece into a full virtual reality experience. Under my direct control, Gordon Freeman is less a time-displaced MIT graduate with a penchant for murder and instead a gawking tourist who’s more interested in staring at canal architecture than liberating humanity. I spend the majority of my time leaning in really close to walls and muttering, “That’s interesting,” before a leaping headcrab shocks me so severely that I damage some more furniture and scare the cat.

        <updated>2023-08-02T12:38:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
He did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. 


“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. 
Fallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” 
While waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you own Half-Life 2 but never bothered with its freebie tech demo, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, do give it a whirl. Its showcase of HDR lighting might have lost the "Huh, nice" factor it had in 2005, but it’s still a satisfying slice of punchy HL2 combat, with a nod to the original Half-Life that Valve regretted not making in the main game. I know this because Valve told me, via Lost Coast's other innovation: its developer commentary.
I love these things, these spinning speech bubbles inflated with knowledge straight from the FPS coalface. So do Valve, judging by how dev commentary has appeared (in identical, node-activatable form) in most of their games since. They’re interesting and illuminating, don’t interfere with the game unless the player wants them to, and help build design literacy. Why, then, don’t more games offer commentary as well?

An Ankou hits early access on August 17th, and I’m very excited to juggle it alongside the zillion other games dropping this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Longtime FromSoftware composer, Yuka Kitamura, has announced via Twitter that they will be leaving FromSoftware to work as a freelancer.
Kitamura has been with FromSoftware for over a decade, first appearing in the credits as Sound Designer for 2013’s Armored Core V. Their first composer credit was for 2014’s Dark Souls II, and they would continue on as a  FromSoftware composer through Bloodborne, Dark Souls III, Sekiro, and Elden Ring.
https://twitter.com/_Yuka_Kitamura_/status/1686310080512466944?s=20
Kitamura did not say if they would continue to work with FromSoftware in a contractor’s position. However, they did go on to say, “I would like to continue to express myself in-game music through various genres of music. I hope you will look forward to my music in the future!” So, whether or not they return for the next Souls-like FromSoftware title, it sounds like they plan to remain in the games industry, just not under FromSoftware's umbrella.
It still hasn’t been said if Kitamura will be doing the soundtrack for the upcoming Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC or Armored Core 6. They have put up a new portfolio website that lists their previous credits, and neither is mentioned. However, that may just be because they haven’t been released yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid growing up in rural New Mexico, I dreaded the first day of school. I had to give up whole days of biking in the desert with my brother and playing video games, sure, but the real problem was school supplies. My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I'd need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn't manage to come to school with. 
That's why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that's one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you're considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor.

        <updated>2023-08-01T20:00:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, we all want a third installment in Valve's iconic Half-Life series. But the sad truth is, it's almost certainly never going to happen. As such, we're stuck with the first two (as well as the VR game Alyx). But that's a good thing, because Half-Life 1 and 2 are exemplary first-person shooters. So loved is the series, that fans continue to tweak and mod Half-Life and Half-Life 2 to their own ends.
Take Team Vestige over on ModDB (via PCGamesN), which has taken the legendary sci-fi FPS and turned it into a horror experience. Called "Disrepair," this mod for Half-Life 2 sees the player slip into the hazard suit of a Combine worker who's been sent to investigate and photograph the radioactive anomalies that have cropped up around the Black Mesa facility.
https://youtu.be/QX-DsNWBp6g
What ensues is a short but creepy experience, not too dissimilar to the likes of Slender: The Eight Pages. The player is tasked with photographing several pieces of artifacts around the infected building, while ominous sounds drill into their ears. It also has a slight SCP vibe about it, in that internet-urban-myth kind of way. You can see YouTube user Farawaygaming diving into "Despair" above.
Take that, Ravenholm!
When you think of Half-Life, you probably don't think of the word "horror." While the games do have their more unsettling moments (the Ravenholm section in HL2 springs to mind), it's not a franchise known for scares.
That's why this Half-Life 2 mod, and others like it, are so interesting. They take something that has a very distinctive aesthetic about it and turn it into something that's fairly unsettling. With the tunnel vision-style lighting, black and white graphics, and the eerie tones of this darker side of Black Mesa, Team Vestige is just one of many reasons people keep returning to the Half-Life games after all these years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has revealed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show, the final announced DLC coming to the Nintendo mashup strategy game that hit Switch last October. 
Shortly after the release of Sparks of Hope last year, Ubisoft announced it had three DLCs planned for the game. The first was The Tower of Doooom, which hit the game this March. Ubisoft released the second DLC, The Last Spark Hunter, last month and now, we know when DLC 3 completes the game’s post-launch roadmap because Rayman in the Phantom Show goes live on August 30. 
You can check out the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3: Rayman in the Phantom Show reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“Rayman is back,” the trailer’s description reads. “And he is the special guest in a new mysterious dimension: the Phantom Opera’s network studio. The Phantom, the charismatic ghostly boss of Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, is also coming back and asking for help to improve his channel’s ratings.” 
When Ubisoft revealed its post-launch content roadmap for Sparks of Hope last year, it said Rayman would be featured in DLC 3 and now, almost a year later, he’s finally here. 
Sparks of Hope’s Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC hits the game on August 30. 
While waiting for this DLC to go live, read Game Informer’s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review. For more Mario, check out the reveal trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and then watch the Super Mario RPG remake trailer afterward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illfonic has dropped the third free DLC pack for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed today. It comes with a new type of ghost based on a Real Ghostbusters figure, a new level, and some new customization options from the 2016 reboot.
The new map takes place in a concert venue, the New Motion Club. It lets you bust ghosts backstage before, I assume, you then dance the night away with some of the lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance. I’m sort of surprised it took this long to get a concert hall location, but I suppose it fits well with the DLC pack’s theme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mountaintop Studios has released the first teaser for its in-development competitive shooter inspired by anime, manga, and comics. 
Mountaintop Studios is a relatively new studio formed in 2020 by Nate Mitchell, a co-founder of Oculus. Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. 
While its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below:

August 1, 2023
As you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. 
“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.
"The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” 

We’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 shooters to play right now and then check out our top scoring reviews of 2023.

What's most important is how they set the tone of the fight and if the intractable nature of the stage is well suited to a fighting game. Let's hear the roar of the crowd and get stuck in on what makes an exciting fighting game stage.

The Xbox maker announced the controller in a blog post, revealing that the controller is available for preorder starting today. It will cost $69.99 and you can purchase it from Xbox’s online store, Microsoft stores, and some local retailers. The controller is onyx blue, with a smoky aesthetic that gives the controller a unique look in the lineup of Xbox Series X/S controllers. 
Microsoft says the design is inspired by clouds and storming skies, “with each billowing puff of vapor bringing a unique design to each controller,” hence the Stormcloud Vapor name. It features rubberized, blue diamond-pattern grips and can hook up to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, PC, mobile phones, and tablets. 
Purchasing this controller also gives you a unique Stormcloud Vapor dynamic background that you can check out in motion in the video below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Published by TinyBuild and developed by Mandragora, the cozy post-apocalyptic survival game, I Am Future, is coming to Steam Early Access on August 8. With that date fast approaching, they’ve released a new trailer highlighting all the features of it.
https://youtu.be/EHwI-4IxivY
I kept getting The Sims in the post-apocalypse vibes from the trailer, and then the hot tub showed up and cemented it. And then I kept watching and thinking, like, “Oh no, this is nothing like The Sims,” but then I just realized that it’s a lot like post-apocalypse The Sims if you took away all the other Sims and let them travel around scavenging.
So, in I Am Future, you play as Chris, potentially the only human left on Earth. And they seem kind of all right with that. I don’t blame them. Their goal is not only to survive but also to search for other survivors and try to unravel the mystery of why the world ended. You explore the sunken city, tear things apart for building materials, and build up your base of operations. You can even build robots to help you with all your chores.
I Am Future is launching into Early Access with “a part” of the main story. The goal for the team is to add new features, areas to explore, and story content over time. They state that they don’t want to keep it “in Early Access for too long,” but are unwilling to give a more detailed estimate on how long they expect it to last.
I Am Future launches into Steam Early Access on August 8. No other platforms have been announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest anime to crossover with Epic Games’ free-to-play battle royale, Fortnite. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account officially announced this crossover today with a quick teaser video showcasing some original characters making shadow puppets on a wall in the battle island’s Mega City locale. Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. 
You can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:


Fortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. 
As for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. 
Fortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper is a game with lots of brilliant individual stories in it, even the ones that end so catastrophically badly that redemption seems nigh on impossible. But when I look back on this tabletop-infused RPG and think of my favourites, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, "Crap. Chaos is coming, and there's nothing I can do to stop it." It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn't quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I'd let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game's 'good' ending really mattered to me back then.
It was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, 'You know what? If we're going no-kill, let's Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.' A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin. But you'd also be totally and utterly wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dishonored 2 is an immersive sim stealth 'em up by Arkane and it's been in my brain a lot more than usual. Partly due to this year's RPS 100, but also because of the mess that was Redfall. Arkane swung at the live service hero shooter and missed, with some comments writing off my sadness in the review as an inevitability. Sure, there's definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don't think there's anything wrong with being hopeful.
I think of Dishonored 2's A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane's past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present. While I can't look into the future, I still think there's worth in turning to an all-time classic of a stealth level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I've started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there's just something about it that can't quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.
The Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer's Paradox, over the weekend. As you'd perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable 'so and so will remember that' choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can't help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that's not just because you're floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four years ago, Baldur's Gate 3 was announced with a trailer that showed how a human could succumb to the small illithid tadpole stuck inside his noggin, thus becoming a mind flayer. The process begins with excruciating headaches, escalates to fingers twisting by themselves, and culminates with an octopus head spouting out of the body. That gross transformation is what you’re (maybe) trying to avoid at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3, but developer Larian Studios have now explained how the parasites "tie into" its RPG systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!

        <updated>2023-07-31T14:17:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. 
VGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). 


The publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. 
VGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.
In February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. 
Regardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product.

The FAQ section states the team feels "very confident in getting everything into the game by April 2025." I'll have the rat-rat-rat-tan chant stuck in my head until then.


Original Story: Patapon’s beloved blend of rhythm and strategy has been sadly relegated to PlayStation consoles, but a new spiritual successor is bringing that cutesy charm to PC as long as the game finds success on Kickstarter. Ratatan was announced at this year’s Bitsummit, and it’s coming from developer Ratata Arts who are led by developers who worked on the original Patapon series. The newest trailer (below) shows off the game’s adorable singing soldiers. Take a look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a new Mortal Kombat 1 trailer focused on the Keepers of Time and Geras, a Mortal Kombat 11 debut character returning as a playable fighter. 
The Mortal Kombat studio has released a steady flow of trailers and gameplay since its MK1 reveal back in May, and that continued over the weekend with a new showcase on the Keepers of Time faction and sand-wielding warrior Geras. In it, we get new looks at Liu Kang, including a new fatality for him, and Geras. 
You can check out the MK1 Keepers of Time trailer for yourself below: 


Over the weekend, MK1 director Ed Boon tweeted an image with what many think might be a new character debuting in the game. Boon writes, “New phone. Who dis?” and circles the unknown character, leading many to believe it’s a tease of a new fighter.

Editor's Note: This story previously stated that two new Mortal Kombat 1 trailers were released over the weekend and linked to a Geras trailer for Mortal Kombat 11. It has been updated to reflect that only one trailer was released – the Keepers of Time trailer – which reveals Geras as a playable fighter.]]></summary>

Venba is a touching, smart, and soulful game that made me want to hug everyone in my family immediately. Though, I do wish the game would’ve marinated in its good ideas a while longer.

Since the launch of the PS5, audiophiles have asked for Dolby Atmos audio support on the console. Without diving too deep into the nitty gritty, Dolby Atmos is one of the best audio formats when adequately supported. While the PS5’s 3D Tempest audio tech is impressive, players have also wished for Dolby Atmos support. And now, with the latest system software beta, it has arrived.

I’ve muddled my way through Elden Ring’s starting peninsula three times now, but have yet to step foot beyond the crumbling gatehouse of Stormveil Castle. The second Godrick The Grafted is reduced to a sickly pile of wobbly limbs, I turn the game off and walk away.
It’s not that I don’t like Elden Ring. I’m not struggling to connect with its open world take on the Souls genre. I’m not put off by the difficult encounters that await me, or the obtuse challenges I’ll be forced to overcome. The answer is weirdly simple. Limgrave provides me with everything I could ever want from a Souls game to the point that when Godrick croaks his final rancid breath and his (presumably) four tongues comically lop out of his stupid mouth, I’m left with the deep satisfaction that comes with the end of a journey, rather than the beginning of one.

But! It turns out to also be a cannily designed mix of old and new turn-based strategy ideas.

You can now try it for yourself, as there's a demo on Steam.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

With almost 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay, we got to see exactly how they work in practice, and most importantly, we got a big long look at the monk's beautifully choreographed staff twirling melee attacks. Yes please and thank you. I have to say, this is instantly more exciting to me than biffing skeletons with my Druid in Diablo 4, and I'm very pumped indeed to try the Monk out for myself when Path Of Exile 2 enters its closed beta in June next year.

Bosses, in particular, will pose much more of a threat this time round, as studio co-founder and Path Of Exile 2 creative director Jonathan Rogers says the big monsters you fought in the first game's campaign were, in hindsight, "pretty anemic".

Since then, however, the scope of Grinding Gear Games action RPG has grown so much in the intervening years that they've now decided to make it a "completely separate game". The news comes from tonight's ExileCon, which also marks the first time we've seen Path Of Exile 2 in action since that original announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["It's been a really long time coming," Grinding Gear Games' co-founder and Path Of Exile 2 creative director Jonathan Rogers tells RPS, but their new action RPG will be getting its first closed beta on June 7th 2024. The news was announced at tonight's ExileCon, where the developers also showed off a big new chunk of the game that focused on its two new classes, the monk and the sorceress - and it looks to be shaping up very well indeed. As for a final launch, however, Rogers isn't quite ready to put a date on that yet.

As an omnipresent robotic voice condescendingly wishes my team luck, my eyes widen in disbelief as a massive portal materializes over a city block. It spews hundreds of raptors that rain from the sky, tumbling down buildings before they sprint in our direction. It’s a jaw-dropping sight, but that awe turns to intimidation at the staggering number of adversaries thirsty for our blood. Our tank units move forward and activate their shields to create a defensive wall. A healer fills health bars to the brim. A sniper tak…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S next spring. 
Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida on stage today, during Day 1 of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023, to reveal the news.
Here's what Spencer had to say:
Spencer says this is a seminal moment "in our relationship with you and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future," perhaps teasing more Final Fantasy to come to Xbox down the line. 
While the game will be playable on both Xbox Series X and Series S, Yoshida says only the Series X version will support 4K resolution. The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. 
This means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. 
For more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review.

Sonic Superstars aims to give players an experience loyal to those initial Classic Sonic entries on the Genesis. However, unlike past games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, which relied heavily on fan-favorite zones from previous games, Sonic Superstars forges its own path within the Classic Sonic series, delivering all-new stages that still deliver that Classic Sonic feel.
"Well-known stages like Green Hill have made return appearances in many games, but that’s because it was necessary from a story point of view," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. "This t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. 
Square Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. 
Check out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: 


Yoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:
 














	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










Speaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. 
“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's DualSense controller is one of the premiere options on PC, offering enhanced trigger rumble ('adaptive triggers') in a handful of games on top of excellent ergonomics and high-quality buttons that are much appreciated in a huge number of racing, action and other titles. These controllers normally cost around £50 to £60, but today they're down to £40 – as part of a Sony summer sale that sees the Sony console drop from £479 to £399. 
There are a wide range of colours available, far beyond the white models that launched with the console in 2020. I'm a fan of the black and camouflage options, but there's also red, pink and blue. Here are links to Amazon and Currys, with the latter offering all colours apart from purple at £40 at the time of writing and Amazon only for black, white and blue.

Or platformers, or double jumping, or dashing, or neon, or being alive in general. Dislike is the wrong word, but "weary neutrality" about covers my feelings when another retro platformer comes down the game tubes.
Gravity Circuit, however, is good enough that I can't not mention it here. It's loud and bright without being obnoxious or overwhelming, fast and precise without being overly demanding, and generally just a damn good effort at creating a modern action platformer whose main influence is obvious, but isn't just going through the motions for the sake of nostalgia. I'm saying it's good, yeah? Maybe not quite for me, but good anyway.

It’s a meaty and satisfying action-platformer with possibly the best-executed comedy and character work of the entire series; a series that’s essentially grown up alongside me, in tone as much as technical sophistication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year when I ask the team to vote for their favourite games of all time ahead of us putting together our annual RPS 100 list, I'm regularly astonished by the sheer breadth of games that fly into my inbox. Everyone on the team has such varied, individual tastes, and it heartens me to see so many different genres and types of games represented every year. This year's list (available to read now in Part One and Part Two is another great testament to that. 
But as we (sometimes) jokingly say any time we compile a big list like this, the games that didn't make the cut are always at #101. Well, this year I thought supporters might like to see those games at #101 this year, and crikey, there are a lot. There are so many here, in fact, that we would have had to have stretched to an RPS 200 to include them all. So here are our honourable mentions this year (listed, for ease), and I'd love to see you try and guess which games belonged to which member of the team.

Hell yeah. Orin the Red is an angry, evil, shapeshifting lady who seems to have a major chip on her shoulder and a lust for destruction and blood. The video doesn't go too much into Orin's role in BG3 beyond the fact that she's super evil, but if you'd like to see snippets of Robertson as Orin in action you can watch the video below:

With Bergamo the flagship AMD EPYC 9754 provides 128 cores with SMT and the Zen 4C cores still boast AVX-512. Another nifty aspect on this high core count CPU catering to cloud service providers is the adjustable TDP from 320 to Watts.

Alas, Diablo 4 is not to be tinkered with. In a post on the game's forums, Blizzard's global community development director Adam Fletcher says that "any game-modifying software" is prohibited and may lead to accounts being permanently banned.

Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, released in 2021, was one of the more successful - although criticism seemed to focus on its high price and relative paucity of characters and stages.

Does that make it a good or a bad thing that Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is in development, then? It'll feature new stages and new characters, while revamping the look and layouts from the original. Among the new characters is Spongebob's perma-frustrated neighbour Squidward, who you can see in the announcement trailer below.

        <updated>2023-07-27T15:24:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. 
Sony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. 


That’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.
However, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.


SEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it:

If you like a good puzzle game, especially if you’re a fan of Valve’s Portal series, The Entropy Centre is worth your time. It was one of my favorite games of last year, and you can read about why in my review of The Entropy Centre. With today’s launch day discount on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase The Entropy Centre for $12.49. 
Check out the Nintendo Switch launch trailer for The Entropy Centre below: 


The Switch version of The Entropy Centre arrives less than a year after the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions launched last November. In the game, players take on the role of protagonist Aria, who awakens inside a colossal space station just outside of a constantly exploding Earth. It’s up to you to figure out why this space station – The Entropy Centre – has been abandoned, why Earth keeps exploding, and why your day resets afterward. You’ll do all this alongside Astra, a talking gun with a great sense of humor.

However, Axiom isn’t the only concern, as players must also fight through Umbral, the realm of the dead.

Disney Illusion Island puts Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy front and center in a Metroidvania adventure, and the result is mostly successful. Where most platformers dole out fun using the adrenaline-inducing triumph of challenge, Illusion Island is instead built around the joy of movement, thanks in part to its combat-less exploration, and the delight of controlling some of the most recognizable mascots in the world. It plays a bit floaty and simple, especially for seasoned fans of the genre, and I wanted my platforming prowess pushed more, but Illusion Island is still a…]]></summary>

Double Dragon may be one of the original pillars of the beat ‘em up genre, but that foundation has weakened in modern times. Infrequent sequels of varying quality have tested Jimmy and Billy Lee’s modern relevance, but Double Dragon Gaiden does a solid job of reinventing the pair with a neat tag team mechanic. Though as enjoyable as this contemporary throwback can be, it often gets in its own way with frustrating combat design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online can now access two of the most beloved Game Boy Color games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. 
As was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.
The Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.
To see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.]]></summary>

So much so that it seemed inevitable that a sequel developed in conjunction with Christian Whitehead, PagodaWest Games, and Headcannon would be next for the Blue Blur.

Headcannon continued working with the Sonic brand through 2022's Sonic Origins and its 2023 update Sonic Origins Plus, while Whitehead founded his own studio, Evening Star, alongside fellow Sonic Mania developers in 2018.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Government's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is considering whether to make it harder for the public to access information about the owners of .US domain names. This is a bad idea, according to the RIAA, which prefers the status quo. Public access to WHOIS information helps to deter piracy, the music group notes, adding that potential privacy concerns are overblown.

I’m not sure I agree with the iconic murder clown. I’m watching the first teaser for Peacock’s Twisted Metal, and while I wasn’t sure what to expect from an adaptation of one of my favorite childhood franchises, whatever hopes I had fell away watching this strange out-of-context clip. Sweet Tooth dancing to and singing the lyrics to Sisqó’s “Thong Song?” Showing a comedic fistfight instead of vehicles blowing each other up? I know the showrunners are aiming for laughs, but what have they done to my game?
After watching the show’s first season, I must confess: I really like Twisted Metal.

The original Remnant: From the Ashes was a surprise success thanks to its Souls-inspired action combined with third-person shooting and randomized environments. The sequel is a refinement with new environments and expanded lore. I enjoyed my time with the game and its final boss and the shooting mechanics feel great, but Remnant II ultimately doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the genres and games that inspired it.

But being a director requires turning a switch in his brain. He's an introvert. But when he goes to work, he has to be an extrovert. He has to lead teams, micromanage, make tough decisions, and accept making mistakes – all skills he says he learned without clear guidance. 
To be able to do that, to make that switch, Johanas says you need to be a "weird psychopath." Though he likes to think he isn't a weird psychopath. "Maybe to some people I am," he says. "I don't know." Nevertheless, no one can be at that level all the time. And yet, here he is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is one of the most anticipated RPGs of the year and even graced Game Informer’s cover back in March. While the game is heading to all platforms, its playable demo has only been available on Switch. Today, it’s PlayStation fans’ turn to sample the upcoming title.
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that you can download the demo on PlayStation consoles, which unfolds in an out-of-context, spoiler-free slice of the game. Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. 
Sea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  
Sea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can learn by checking out our exclusive coverage hub with features such as an interview with Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda about the soundtrack he crafted for the game.

Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto, Brooklyn Nine-Nine) portrays Quiet, the revenge-driven partner of protagonist John Doe. Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man: No Way Home, Divorce) brings a cold ruthlessness to the main antagonist Agent Stone. Lastly, All Elite Wrestling/Ring of Honor's Joe Seanoa, AKA Samoe Joe, dons the iconic mask of Sweet Tooth, bringing an intimidating physical performance to compliment the voice work of Will Arnett. In my conversations, I picked their brains about the elements that drew them to the series, their familiarity with and thoughts on the video games, and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light developer, Techland has announced a partnership with Tencent that will see the massive Chinese holdings company become the studio’s majority shareholder.
In a blog post penned by Techland founder and CEO Paweł Marchewka, he explains the studio has partnered with Tencent for support of its continued expansion of the Dying Light series and to ensure its upcoming fantasy RPG lives up to expectations.
“Teaming up with Tencent will allow us to move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games,” Pawel writes. “We have chosen an ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things.”
Pawel states that he will remain CEO, and Techland will retain full ownership of its IPs. He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.
This is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others.

As someone who grew up primarily in the 1990s, I’ve played more than my fair share of 2D platformers. With those decades of experience, it’s no surprise that I consider myself a relatively strong platforming player. However, despite its precise controls, Mr. Run and Jump’s challenging, neon-bathed obstacle courses and hard-to-reach collectibles had me second-guess my skills at every step.
Developed initially as a homebrew Atari 2600 game, Mr. Run and Jump errs on the side of simplicity with i…]]></summary>

Madden NFL 24 brings new improvements to the FieldSense system, Franchise, Superstar, and even the skeletons of the on and off-field character models. Not only that but this year signals the return of the popular minigames that have been missing for many years. 
However, one of the biggest announcements each year comes in the form of the player ratings heading into the new season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>
