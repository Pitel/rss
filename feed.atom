        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The asymmetrical survival game begins in October
Bandai Namco has locked in a launch date for multiplayer survival game Dragon Ball: The Breakers. The asymmetrical horror begins on October 14, 2022.
Dragon Ball: The Breakers is a game set in the popular anime series, but in multiplayer survival horror form. Players take on the role of either seven average citizens, caught in a temporal seam; or the immensely powerful Dragon Ball villains hunting them down, a.ka. the Raider.
These villains include Buu, Cell, and Frieza, who got a new trailer today. The idea is to make it out alive through teamwork and clever use of distractions and tactics. Otherwise, the ordinary players will all perish at the hands of Dragon Ball's meanest and most vile. In Frieza's case, this means a lot of explosions, l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft’s open-world title set in James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy universe, will now launch sometime in either 2023 or 2024. The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. 
Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison series. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

It's a light year for Ubisoft, and the publisher's future lineup just got lighter. As disclosed during the company's Q1 fiscal 2022-23 earnings report, Ubisoft has decided to cancel four upcoming games, including Splinter Cell VR and Ghost Recon Frontline. This year's Avatar game, meanwhile, was delayed — it's now aiming for fiscal year 2023.
As reported by Axios' Stephen Totilo, Ubisoft told investors that it canceled the development of Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two unannounced games.
Splinter Cell VR might seem like a hazy memory at this point. It was announced for Oculus headsets alongside an Assassin's Creed VR game back in 2020, and we never had much to go on other than the lead developer: Ubisoft's Red Storm Entertainm…]]></summary>

But what do dogs (the superior pet, if we're being honest with ourselves) think about this feline adventure? 
We've enlisted Regan, my real-life chihuahua, to help us play Stray. Watch as she almost certainly immediately falls asleep in my lap while I play the first hour or so. If you have any questions, feel free to jump in chat and ask! 
But that's not all. I recently convinced Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner to let me use my corporate credit card to buy a Gundam model. So, legally, I now have to do something work-related with it. Let's build it on stream. That's right, it's a double feature tonight, folks! Cats and Mecha. What a time to be alive.

This coming fortnight sees the arrival of explosive action sequel Azure Striker Gunvolt 3, which will be bringing its hi-tech carnage to Xbox and Nintendo Switch. But if you're a PC owner wanting in on the fast-paced, retro-styled action, then fear not, as Inti Creates has announced that the cool-looking release will be getting a Steam port this winter.
As we have previously reported, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 is the long-awaited third chapter in a saga that began on Nintendo 3DS way back in 2014. This new chapter will see dual heroes Gunvolt and Kirin hack, slash, and shoot their way through flashy 2.5D platform action. Switching between the two characters on the fly, players will be encouraged to synergize each character's respective skills to fight off an army of dangerous droids and towering end-of-stage guardians.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3icCimtZdLI
Adding to this anime-infused chaos, an intriguing new mechanic known as "Image Pulse" will enable Gunvolt to utilize his memories of battle to call upon the skills of his former opponents, arming himself with the skills of over 150 allies and enemies from the entire trilogy. Additionally, Gunvolt and Kirin will be guided by the evocative, dulcet tones of their virtual oracle, Anthem, whose song will spearhead the duo's assault and even boost their battle abilities. Some fascinating little features there.
Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 launches on Nintendo Switch July 28. An Xbox edition will launch on August 2, with the PC port scheduled for this winter. A physical edition is currently in the works at Limited Run Games, with price, details, and release date still to be revealed.

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.
In creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pandora will have to wait
Ubisoft is pushing one of its games out of this year. The publisher confirms today that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is moving to fiscal year 2023-2024.
Previously set to launch in 2022, this delay pushes Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora out of the year and up to at least April 2023. The news arrived via Ubisoft's financial earnings today, and no more specifics were given on a date.
It shouldn't be a huge surprise though, as we've yet to see much of this new Avatar game. While a June 2021 trailer gave us a cinematic look at what's in store, we haven't seen much else in the time since.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axmg1E4HrVE
It does seem to be more of the Navi and space corporation fighting each other, much like in the original Avatar film. The Frontiers of Pandora game is also set for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but not previous-generation consoles.
In its financial statement, Ubisoft says it is working on taking full advantage of next-gen technology, as it sees the Avatar brand as a "major multi-year opportunity" for Ubisoft.
The fall window ahead
Ubisoft also announced a few more changes to its upcoming slate. First off, it delayed a smaller but unannounced premium game from 2022-2023 into 2023-2024.
Also, as noted by Axios' Stephen Totilo on Twitter, Ubisoft canceled development of four more games. These are Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two unannounced games. No further details were given on why.
This still leaves two fairly large games in Ubisoft's upcoming fall lineup. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is set for October 20, 2022 on Nintendo Switch. And the long-awaited pirate ship sim Skull and Bones finally locked in a date for November 8, on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and cloud services. Those who wanted to fly across the plains of Pandora this year will have to settle for the high seas instead.

Originally released on PS Vita, Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana was the then-latest chapter in the decades-long Ys adventure series. It tells the story of a shipwrecked adventurer who finds themselves embroiled in a fated tale of ancient gods, primordial monsters, and, of course, the extinction of all life on the planet as we know it. I mean, it's a JRPG, so I'm not quite sure what you were expecting.

Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours.

Bungie has announced a new showcase to highlight what's next in the world of Destiny 2. The studio will host a Destiny 2 showcase on August 23.
The stream will go live on August 23. Though no mention was made of platform, you can probably assume the Bungie Twitch account is a safe bet. No time has been announced just yet.
https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1550133920838008833
"Witness what's next," the tweet advertises. Whatever it is, that fleet of pyramid ships sure does seem like bad news for all Guardians out there.
As for what's in store, Destiny 2 is still in the throes of wrapping up the story from The Witch Queen expansion. The game is currently in the midst of the Season of the Haunted, which ends on August 23.
The light ahead
A new season is likely in the cards. More content leading up to the next expansion seems pretty likely too. Lightfall is the next expansion due up on Bungie's Destiny 2 roadmap and we don't have a firm picture of that yet, save that it's likely a 2023 launch given Witch Queen's launch this year.
Bungie does have one more expansion confirmed for after Lightfall, dubbed The Final Shape, in the conclusion of what it's calling the Light and Darkness saga. It seems like the roadmap stretches pretty far out into the future for the online shooter.
The Destiny 2 studio has also gone through some changes over the last year or so, though. Bungie is now officially a PlayStation studio, as the acquisition has finally closed out.
It seems like interesting times ahead for the studio behind the persistent multiplayer sci-fi shooter. We'll see what Bungie has in store for the future of Destiny 2 on August 23.

This Monster Hunter Rise Japanese ad (which came out near the expansion's launch, but was recently spotted by Nintendo Life) from Capcom clocks in at under three minutes, but I've watched it multiple times now.
The debut tweet for the Monster Hunter Rise Japanese commercial is very succinct: this man sings, dances, and hunts! That's all you need to know, as that's a fairly good description of this lounge singer turned Monster Hunter peddler. Around a minute and a half in it gets wackier, with the man showing up in the game with crude effects: it's the best part!
Capcom has been doing a bang-up job when it comes to its Japanese advertisement arm, as the Resident Evil Village puppet shows are also fantastic. Someone over in that department needs a raise, but given the crossover, just air these on western channels!
At this point Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak has been out for a few weeks, and it's been going pretty well for Capcom. Given how long the legs are with modern Monster Hunter games, it seems likely that Sunbreak will eventually arrive in the top 10 all-time seller list for the publisher.
I'm sure some exec somewhere is singing "Viva Sunbreak!" in their offices.

There's more wackiness to be had with Monster Hunter Rise Japanese commercials too, with the comedian ZAZY and actor Yuki Yamada:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading for Robots
Quantic Dream's sci-fi drama title Detroit: Become Human is getting set to make a comeback, but not quite in the form you might have expected. As reported by Famitsu, the 2018 cinematic adventure is being adapted into a manga series, with the first volume of Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories hitting the streets of Japan tomorrow.
Choosing to take its own localized narrative over that of the video game, Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories will tell the tale of an android idol, who models, performs, and entertains her fans in the far-flung future of 2038. Much like the video game, however, the manga will confront the typical themes of robotic sentience, the dangers of advanced A.I., and the prejudice of man against those different from themselves. The story is written by Kazami Sawatari with the art daubed by Moto Sumida.
https://twitter.com/sawatari_kazami/status/1549590228934963201?s=20&t=CbiFSUq8L1hu3ltcYh97uQ
The new manga is not the first non-gaming adaptation of the Quantic Dream title. In fact, it's not the first time the franchise has focused on Japan for its chin-stroking pontification. Back in 2018, Sony Japan released a short movie, Tokyo: Become Human, to help promote the game's launch within the territory. The new manga genuinely sounds pretty interesting, with themes suited to Japan's love of next-generation technology. Unfortunately, there are currently no plans for an English localization, but perhaps we will see a fan translation down the line.
Detroit: Become Human is available now on PC and PS4.

That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we'll get to a proper badminton game.
Badminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nani?
The Apex Legends anime event is now underway, and will be available for the next few weeks or so (until August 2, 2022).
As is the case with many battle royale tie-ins, it's mainly an opportunity to sell cosmetics, as there are "40 event-limited" items to peruse in Apex Legends, led by the Revenant, Mirage, Octane, and Wattson legendary skins. All of those are featured in the promo video below, which is a fun little literal gaiden (side story) dealing with core cast members in anime form. Wattson even literally does a Kamehameha, but the One Piece, My Hero Academia, and Naruto inspirations are the most obvious places the development team goes.
There's also a big spender promo going on, as you can "unlock all the skins to automatically get the Bangalore Apex Commander prestige skin." I mean, this IP has to have a TV show at some point, right? That's just how every lucrative "this didn't go out of business for several years" gaming IP rolls now.
An anime tie-in event is a normal theme to go for in the genre (as well as MOBAs), as it kind of just seems inevitable. A lot of the developers on these games are fans of the medium, not to mention it has a lot of potential to sell copious amounts of out-there skins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. 
For those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. 
The new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. 


Dragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.]]></summary>

One of video gaming's most unstoppable, unavoidable, and most dedicated monsters is coming to a living room near you soon. As unveiled by merch-makers JustGeek, Resident Evil 3's terrifying stalker, Nemesis, has been immortalized in statue form, and is ready and waiting for your pre-order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32LJ9H9cN9Q
The PVC statue stands just under 11 inches in height and sees the Umbrella Corps' most devastating asset depicted in all of his hideous, gory glory. A mess of torn leather, twisted sinew, melted flesh, and bin bag clothing, JustGeek's new statue hopes to disgust as much as it bemuses, with attention paid to every crease, fold, and tear in both Nemesis' clothing and his face. And as if his huge frame wasn't enough to get your inner Jill running, yer boy is equipped with his wall-shattering rocket launcher. Kaboom.

The Resident Evil Nemesis statue is now available to pre-order over on the JustGeek store. Nemesis retails for £99.99, (or roughly $120 USD), not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Payment options are also available. Nemesis is expected to ship in November 2022, although this is subject to change given the general material and production woes impacting the general industry.
For more details, images, and payment options, go check out the official JustGeek website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, it has a wingsuit
When the new 2022 Saints Row game was announced, I was legitimately surprised. A full reboot feels like the best direction to take a series that once brought us to hell and tangoed with aliens and superheroes, and we recently had the chance to put this to the test with a Saints Row hands-on session.
So what's the verdict? Well after playing the first few story missions and four full hours of the open world (via a later save file), I can safely say that it feels like a comfortable mix of the seriousness of Saints Row 2, and the silliness of Saints Row 3.

Before the internet was widely adopted (how to date yourself, 101), a lot of games lived in secrecy, particularly JRPGs. For me, Seiken Densetsu 3 was the granddaddy of them all. The phrase "Secret of Mana sequel" was enough to activate thousands of JRPG fan sleeper agents everywhere, which led to the proliferation of fan translations, and thus, the legacy of the game itself. But I couldn't play everything back then, and Live A Live was another big JRPG that eluded me — until now.

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.

Boisterous business discussions and the clanking of silverware ring out from the crowded patio of a corner restaurant in the heart of Champaign, Illinois, a small college town two hours south of Chicago. Lording over these hungry patrons is the stoic face of Deep Silver Volition. The studio’s logo hangs a few stories above the lunch spot on the side of a brownstone building. Many eating here today are likely Volition employees, and they have reason to celebrate with a feast, as their studio’s next game, Saints Row, is nearing completion.

Footage has surfaced online that appears to have been captured from Naughty Dog's remake, The Last of Us Part I. The video was first brought to light by XboxEra co-founder Nick Baker, who claims to have received the leaked footage of the unreleased title from one of their sources.
The three clips, running a total of around six minutes in length, give us a look at world-weary protagonists Joel and Ellie as they pick their way through the decay of Boston in the terrifying aftermath of a mutant infestation, born out of the disgusting "Cordyceps" fungus. The videos highlight gameplay from the highly anticipated remake, as the duo engage in some stealth action, some brutal gunplay, and take time out for a spot of crafting at one of Joel's trusty workbenches.…]]></summary>

The others (the Canyne Malzeno Palamute and the Felyne Malzeno Palico) are nowhere to be found in the region.
Here's a quick recap of how the Sunbreak amiibo situation is going worldwide:
You can pre-order them now on Play-Asia or Amazon Japan, but they'll be shipping in late September/August depending on the retailer: some users are reporting that Play-Asia is canceling select pre-orders
Some UK/EU regions are reporting that they are available at retail, and are all out now with the releas…]]></summary>

So far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is putting its best foot forward. We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called "A Life Sent On."
Shared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a "somber flute-based melody," which is played by "off-seers" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cole's Legacy is free to claim
As time goes on, it's shockingly easy for DLC to get lost in the cracks, even for a series as well-known as inFAMOUS. While Sucker Punch Productions recently went on record to say that the team isn't working on a new inFAMOUS (or Sly Cooper) game right now, there is a bit of news: some DLC for inFAMOUS Second Son popped up on the PlayStation Store.
If you were browsing the storefront today to see what's new, this "July 20" release would've been a head-turner — but the DLC in question, Cole's Legacy, is not new for inFAMOUS Second Son. These missions were originally a part of the limited edition.
In a move that other studios should try and follow, Sucker Punch has released Cole's Legacy for free in "most regions, except those that require a small fee due to local restrictions," so you can claim the DLC right now on the PlayStation Store. Might as well!

https://youtu.be/T4XlJrbY3ow
Play it for the jacket, if anything
It's worth going through if you have a deep personal history with inFAMOUS and inFAMOUS 2; Zeke's back, kinda, but the scope is admittedly limited. The main thing: if you complete Cole's Legacy, you'll be able to dress up Second Son star Delsin with Cole's jacket.
On Twitter, Sucker Punch also confirmed that it hopes to separately release Fetch's D.U.P. outfit — a former pre-order bonus — for inFAMOUS First Light. And maintenance on the inFAMOUS 2 UGC (user-generated content) servers has wrapped up, as promised.
Games often tie outfits or smaller pieces of content to pre-orders, first-wave "day one" editions, and collector's sets. It can be a way to incentivize early adoption without going overboard. The problem is, some of this stuff is never offered again, and it becomes lost to time. In cases like this, it's never too late to make it right — fans will be thankful.
They'd also appreciate remasters of the PS3 games. Just saying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2021 movie's director could be returning to the chair
The sequel to Mortal Kombat (2021) could be seeing a familiar face at the helm. Deadline reports that Simon McQuoid is set to return to the Mortal Kombat follow-up.
McQuoid made his feature film directorial debut on Mortal Kombat, which hit both theaters and HBO Max last year.
We got confirmation in January that New Line Cinema had reportedly greenlit the sequel. Deadline also reports that Moon Knight writer Jeremy Slater is writing the screenplay for the Mortal Kombat sequel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBa_aHwCbC4
No other details are known about the follow-up just yet.
A new tournament
It's little surprise we're seeing a follow-up. Mortal Kombat did pretty well, especially considering its simultaneous streaming and theater debut.
The 2021 film even left off on a cliffhanger, with Raiden saying he wanted to train up a new roster of fighters. Film character Cole is seen setting off for Los Angeles, possibly in search of a certain movie star with some martial arts prowess.
While it certainly had some high points and some dips, I overall enjoyed my time with the new Mortal Kombat. It had some good action and fight scenes. The Scorpion vs. Sub Zero fight scene was worth admission on its own.
Meanwhile, the video game adaptation train carries on at full speed. The HBO Last of Us production looks set for next year, and Sonic the Hedgehog continues to break the box office with even more in the works. Heck, even Duke Nukem might be getting in on the silver screen bandwagon.
Considering that Mortal Kombat turned out pretty okay compared to other video game adaptations, I'm game to see a new one and find out where Cole's story goes from here. Though hopefully it doesn't fall down the same animal-shaped potholes that Mortal Kombat: Annihilation did.

For long-time fans of Naughty Dog, seeing industry vet Bruce Straley step away from game development in 2017 was a pretty devastating loss — he played a huge role in making Uncharted 2, Uncharted 4, and The Last of Us, after all. Now, five years later, Straley has just announced that he will be jumping back into the world of game development by forming his very own studio known as Wildflower Interactive.
"Wildflower starts with everything I created, pushed and learned about gameplay, characters and story, and directing teams while at Naughty Dog — but applied to a smaller studio to keep communication easy and creatively fluid," Straley says.
"I’ve surrounded myself with an amazing group — some new faces, some old colleagues — that are pushing our concepts of what kind of game we want to create, the process we use to make it, the kind of team and culture we all want to be a part of, and what giving back to our industry ultimately looks like."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMEgkVZTLIM
Straley even created a video to give us a little insight into his process of creating the studio, which all started with an idea that he and some colleagues were bouncing around. When they realized that that game was something they had to make, well, that's how Wildflower was born.
As someone who really admires Straley's work, it's really cool to not only see him return, but to see him looking genuinely happy to do so. Based on ideas he's shared in the past for the kinds of games he wants to make, I'll be interested to see how Wildflower shakes things up in the future.
Straley said that the studio is going to "go silent for a bit" to "focus on building the team and game," but I know we'll have a ton to look forward to from them in the future.

Publisher Microids and developer Oddworld Inhabitants have announced that 2021 sequel Oddworld: Soulstorm is preparing to bring its quirky adventure and grim fantasy world to the Nintendo Switch platform in the form of Oddworld: Soulstorm Odditimized Edition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yvwwcwFe74
Already available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, Oddworld: Soulstorm is the sequel to 2014's Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty and is itself a "reimagining" of the 1998 release Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. The side-scrolling stealth adventure tells the story of Mudokan Abe as he once again risks life and limb to protect the sanctity of his people from armies of greedy, capitalist overlords. Outnumbered and outgunned, Abe must use cunning, guile, scavenged goods, and his fellow escapees in order to turn fortune in his favor, lest his race is wiped out by the miserable Glukkons.

In addition to the Nintendo Switch port news, Microids also revealed two physical "odditions" that are also in production. A standard Limited Oddition includes a physical boxed copy of Oddworld: Soulstorm, three art prints, and a metal carry case that holds up to 24 Switch cartridges. For die-hard fans, the Collector's Oddition includes the aforementioned items, but also adds a hardcover art book, a keychain, sticker sheet, and a figurine of our hero in full-on tiptoe mode.
Pre-order customers will also receive a digital soundtrack as well as a digital version of the art book. While pre-orders for the physical odditions are live, Microids seem a little closed on where exactly the physical version can be pre-ordered — with different territories carrying different participating retailers. In addition, neither a price nor a release date for the Switch edition of Oddworld: Soulstorm is available.

We're well into summer, and that means scorching days, soothing Seals & Crofts, and lots of gaming deals. The PlayStation Store Summer Sale started today with over a thousand deals on PS4 and PS5 games lasting through Wednesday, August 3 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific.
The bulk of the sale is going to be older stuff, naturally — but a few newer releases stand out in the crowd. Supermassive Games' cinematic horror romp The Quarry, Sloclap's tense martial arts brawler Sifu, Saber Interactive's team-based Evil Dead: The Game, and Team Ninja's super eclectic Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin are worth a nod.
With an eye toward games with new low pricing, here are some recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in June, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered swings to PC this August. If you've been wondering how the game will take advantage of your gaming rig, a new trailer runs down the list of features that will make Peter Parker’s adventure even more spectacular. 


Spider-Man will be treated to a host of graphical and performance upgrades, such as: 
Unlocked framerates
Nvidia DLSS AI performance boost
Nvidia DLAA AI enhanced image quality
Ultra-wide monitor support
Ray-traced reflections (for compatible PCs)
Improved shadows
DualSense controller support
As a reminder, this Remastered version of the 2018 title launched on PlayStation 5 as a pack-in with Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. As such, the PC version is the first time it's been available as a standalone product. In addition to introducing Peter Parker's redesigned face, the remaster also includes the Black Cat-focused story expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, and exclusive suits such as Spidey's outfits from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launches on Steam and The Epic Games Store on August 12. You can read our review of the original PS4 version here. Miles Morales is also slated to come to PC later this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quit bugging me
Obsidian Entertainment's well-received backyard adventure Grounded is set to receive a TV adaptation. The animated series is currently in pre-production as a joint venture between Bardel Entertainment, Kinetic Media, and SC Productions. A premiere date was not announced.
"Grounded has caught the imagination of millions of people and we've learned that the biggest fans want even more of that world," said game director Adam Brennecke in a press release. "This partnership will allow us to give fans more Grounded while expanding the world that so many have come to love."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsUvQaTi6nc
The Grounded show will, much like its video game counterpart, tell the story of a group of kids forced to fend themselves against bugs and critters of all shapes and sizes when they are shrunken down via some mysterious and unstable technology. And if fending off gargantuan wasps, spiders, ants, and beetles weren't enough, the kids must find a way to return to full size in order to expose a conspiracy threatening the entire town... Think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids meets All the President's Men. Probably.
Grounded will be written by Brent Friedman (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Star Trek: Enterprise) and directed by Brien Goodrich (Halo). A special panel is set to take place at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) where the first details about the show, its premise, characters, and cast are likely to be outlined. Production for the Grounded TV show is in its infancy, so it is very unlikely that we'll see it hit our screens until later in 2023 at the very earliest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.
However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.
Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.

These custom-painted Animal Crossing sneakers look so good, I initially thought they were an official product — but nope! They're actually a project from artist kelfunncheng.
In the 10-ish-minute video below, which is really down-to-earth to the point where the process actually seems feasible, they walk us through how they managed to craft the shoes. Talking us through, kelfunncheng says that this is their first time painting shoes, and they wanted to document the entire process.
There's a lot of preparation involved, including cleaning up the shoes, and taping them up. The creator practiced on several household objects to test shades/color mixing, as well as a general painting technique. Again, it's a really relatable video, as they even talk through a few minor issues before getting started (like how the air hose was loose, which prevented air from coming out of the brush); including stuff that might actually happen to a normal person trying it themselves.
The kicker? This was all spurred on as a gift for their sister. Wholesome! Animal Crossing is so ubiquitous (especially after New Horizons) that I feel like you could theoretically give anyone a gift of something based out of this universe and they'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life in space
Hello Games is back with another big update, this time addressing freighters. The massive hub ships get an overhaul in the Endurance Update for No Man's Sky today, making space-base life even cooler.
The Endurance Update takes a huge rework to the freighter bases of No Man's Sky. New parts and themed rooms with customization options let you design the Normandy, Rocinante, or Enterprise of your dreams.
Specialist crew will also now walk around your base, having thoughts and patrolling the area. Agricultural Modules let players build a farm on their ship, taking Stardew Valley into the stars. And freighter exteriors can get some observation decks and catwalks for a little out-of-ship sightseeing stroll, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSvwcneTNu4
Base-building also gets a few quality-of-life updates, like preview holograms showing up through walls. Existing base parts can be replaced without deleting their old spots, so you don't have to worry too much about snapping on just right.
Plus, the universe gets even more beautiful with enhanced nebulae and black holes. Asteroids get a little more varied too, adding a bit more for the miners out there. And if you like creepy stuff, well, you can seek out some organic frigates too.
Home, home among the stars
Of course, alongside the big updates to freighters and celestial forces, there are also a ton of other small touch-ups and quality-of-life improvements. Hello Games keeps carrying on with No Man's Sky updates, building up and up with each new update, like clockwork.
The space life sim is also expected to arrive on Nintendo Switch on October 7, 2022. After seeing these huge freighters and vast ship layouts, I'm pretty intrigued to see how this universe manages to squeeze onto the Switch. Until then, the Endurance Update is live for all platforms that No Man's Sky is available on today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfect Fit
Fashion label RSVLTS has expanded its range of pop-culture-themed apparel with a new line of shirts based on Capcom's genre-defining release Street Fighter II. The new shirts feature designs that reflect the style, characters, and aesthetic of the 1991 fighting game that changed the industry forever.
There are three designs in the RSVLTS Street Fighter line: "Knockout Zones," which features various World Warrior sprites against a collage of classic stages; "Super Combos," which features stylized depictions of characters such as E Honda and Zangief set amongst input terminology; and finally "Art of Ansatsuken," which sports a collage of Ryu and Ken in artwork recognizable from the Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo, and Super Street Fighter II series.

Each shirt features a button-down, short sleeve design, and is crafted from the company's trademark "Kunuflex" material, which offers a snug fit with some give for fabric stretch. Available in sizes XS to 4XL, each shirt retails for $68 USD, not including shipping or any potential customs charges. You can check out the shirts and their designs, along with a detailed measurement guide, over on the RSVLTS website.
While they are all a little too brightly colored to be seen on yer favorite aging, gaming Goth, I will admit that I do like the "Super Combos" design — I dig that summery shade of green. In addition to the Street Fighter shirts, RSVLTS also produces clothing that features iconic brands such as TMNT, The Goonies, Marvel and DC Comics, and Star Wars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the games release schedule starting to ease up a bit, I've finally found some time to really dig into The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe. I've enjoyed revisiting this meta first-person puzzler, but sometimes I can only manage small chunks before its endlessly repeating corridors start to feel like they're bearing down on me a bit. Thankfully, its latest quality of life update might just be the thing I need. As well as introducing a swathe of new accessibility features, its auto-walk function now has a toggle option - and as developers Crows Crows Crows have noted on Twitter, this means that "so long as you're in a straight corridor it allows the game to play itself!" Magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming August 12
Sony has provided new details for the Spider-Man PC port via a PC edition trailer, including confirmation of an unlocked framerate, among other goodies.
Set to arrive on August 12, it'll feature a new graphical setting suite, including the aforementioned unlocked framerate, on top of ray-tracing for reflections and shadows, and ultra-wide monitor support. Here's the description straight from Sony:
"Enjoy a variety of graphics quality options to tailor to a wide range of devices, unlocked framerates, and support for other technologies including performance boosting NVIDIA DLSS and image quality enhancing NVIDIA DLAA."

Beyond that there's haptic feedback and DualSense controller support for wired USB users, as well as "full mouse and keyboard support" with customizable controls. You can get a look at all that in the trailer, embedded below.
Oh, and if you're going this route, here are the pre-order bonuses for the Spider-Man PC port:
Iron Spider Suit
Velocity Suit
Spider-Punk Suit
"Early access" to the Spider-Drone Gadget
5 skill points that you can use at the start of the game
Of course, mods are part of the package too! Thankfully you'll have options, as it'll be available on both Steam and Epic Games. Note, however, that all these upgrades come with a $60 price tag. The current market rate for a new copy of the game (Game of the Year Edition) on PS4 is around $30 physical, $20 digital.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of it covers the first five hours
Nintendo just debuted a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 overview video on the company's Japanese YouTube account, and it's pretty comprehensive! Despite the fact that it's in Japanese, it's actually very easy to tell what's going on.
Here's what the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 overview touches on, vaguely:
Intercut big picture/conflict story elements, and the war between the two major factions
The interpersonal relationships between the six core party members
Lots of footage of overworld exploration
An in-depth look at combat, the different roles, combos, and swapping between party members
The Ouroboros system unveiled in one of the first debut videos
The "guest" party system (this is arguably the most spoiler-heavy part, as it showcases a ton of characters at once)
Township wandering/camp use/gemcrafting
A season pass recap and an amiibo support explanation (ours is more informational!)
In other Xenoblade-related news, Nintendo even came out with a digital calendar for July, which has a cheeky marked-off spot on July 29 to celebrate the release of the game. To grab it you'll need to spend 50 My Nintendo platinum points (just remember that it's a digital download, not a physical calendar).
Hopefully we'll get some news as to what the My Nintendo physical reward is soon enough! Typically that info comes within seven days of the game's release, give or take a week.
[Update: As of July 20, Nintendo has provided a new English version of the trailer. You can find the original Japanese video and the additional English one below.]

Well, two more old-school games are releasing on the DRM-free storefront today: Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance 2 and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. The arrival of the latter kicks off a sale on Warhammer games.

It takes some serious stamina to scroll through the patch notes. Looks like it might be worth perusing all the way through them though, with this 3.94 update to the game majorly reworking freighter bases and shipping in some NPC crew members to populate them with. This crew will even share their thoughts as they’re wandering about. See for yourself in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky’s 20th free update, Endurance, soars into the game today. Hello Games describes Endurance as an “overhaul” to the freighter captain experience, giving players new tools and functionality that make commanding a fleet of ships more entertaining and manageable. 
Players can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. 


Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.]]></summary>

In between challenges, and flashbacks to covering the floor of my grandparents’ house with ribbons of orange plastic, I’ve also been testing how the DLC’s new skybound setting performs on PC.

You're right. Considering RimWorld cribbed plenty of its own notes from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, it might feel incongruous to criticise Clanfolk for clinging too tightly to the hem of its inspiration. Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game.

The game’s reveal caught my eye thanks to its striking art direction and unique gameplay. I’ve spent the last couple of days battling the darkness as the titular Victoria Bloom, a precocious young girl searching her ancestral home for her missing uncle after it’s been overtaken by shadow monsters. Armed with a powerful flashlight, you’ll battle a living darkness in an ever-changing mansion steeped in mystery and secrets. 
I’m enjoying the game, but it took longer than I would’ve liked to get used to its strange control scheme. Eyes in the Dark plays like a twin-stick shooter, with players using the left stick for movement and the right stick to aim their auto-damagi…]]></summary>

In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts.

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.
While Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in April that the Switch-exclusive No More Heroes 3 was expanding its horizons to other platforms, but now we know Travis Touchdown’s latest adventure makes the move in October.
A flashy new trailer reveals that on October 11, No More Heroes 3 migrates to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. 


No More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: 
“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a blog post on the official BioWare website, Star Wars: The Old Republic's creative director, Charles Boyd, announced his departure. Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will "carry forward our vision for the game."
The blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: 
Last December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.]]></summary>

Well then, you’ll be chuffed to hear that Romero Games is hiring for a new first-person shooter project that has the involvement of legendary FPS maestro John Romero. The company says they’re now “100% focused” on the genre, and they’re making a game with a major publisher using Unreal Engine 5. That’ll make the shotgun blasts look extra kerblammerific.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a hot minute since a cute animal adventure scarred me for life. Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.
Endling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, Lego has dished out its fair share of nostalgia-inducing sets, from massive Star Wars tributes to a faithful, brick-by-brick replica of the NES. Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. 

The Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”
The Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99. Will you be securing a set for yourself?

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/19/yakuza-8-screenshots-possibly-revealed-in-studio-tour"/>
        <updated>2022-07-19T13:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura enjoyed his tour of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, capturing footage of the various workspaces, Sega president Haruki Satomi (he conducted the tour), and even some new Yakuza screenshots. Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. 


Like a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  
The off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)
July 19, 2022
In any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:
"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series."

I'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. 
The Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.
We were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.
You can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's Honey, I Shrunk The Kids-inspired survival game Grounded has been tapped for a new animated series, Deadline reports.
Grounded, currently playable in Xbox Game Preview/Steam Early Access and slated to launch in full this September, will be adapted by writer Brent Friedman whose credits include Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Wars: Rebels/The Clone Wars. Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.
Deadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.
"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community," says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. "We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series."
The Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform. Meanwhile, the video game is only a couple of months from its full launch after spending two years in early access. It will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Decisions have unforeseen consequences. If one were to look for the thematic idea that links the story of As Dusk Falls with its gameplay structure, it’s hard to avoid that statement as a driving message. Life is filled with decisions big and small that shape the future, and we don’t always know how an errant word or turn down a different road might eventually conclude. Interior/Night’s emotionally rich and risky debut game isn’t interested in giving you the choice of how the character’s lives turn out; like in real life, that’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are masters of their domain. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.
Stray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.

Stray is a game about being a cat. You see, explore, and mess with the world in the ways only they can. Because you're doing so in one of the more densely-packed video game worlds in recent memory, there's plenty of room for kitty antics. Luckily, Stray wastes no moment letting you fulfill any feline aspirations you may have. 
After being separated from their furry friends, the unnamed cat (we'll call "Stray") finds itself deep in an underground city walled off from the outside by a giant dome. Befriending a small drone named B12, Stray sets out to open the city, t…]]></summary>

Far from being just another PC hardware thing to check off, they look like they might be alright?


Both hit the 2560x1440 resolution with a 165Hz refresh rate, with the Canvas 27QHD being a flat 27in screen and the Canvas 32QHD Curved being 32in and… well, curved. They support AMD FreeSync Premium, meaning they should work with Nvidia G-Sync as well, and come with anti-glare coatings to see off reflections.

When I first sampled the tower defence deckbuilding delights of ORX a couple of months ago, I'd assumed that we'd be playing as the demo's medieval castle builders throughout. Today, however, devs Johnbell have announced a brand-new faction for the game, the sand-loving Dune Reavers. Even more intriguing, though, is that the Dune Reavers aren't actually big fans of building, you know, towers, favouring instead the brute force approach of their large armies. Can you still call it tower defence if there aren't any towers involved? Decide for yourself by watching the new gameplay trailer below.

Split perfectly into two chunks that cover three chapters each, it's a thrilling adventure that deserves a prime time slot in your evenings over the weekend.

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said that games companies and platforms needed to ensure parental purchase controls and age restrictions were in place to let kids play without the risk of harm, and to put parents’ minds at ease. Xbox’s parental restrictions on loot box purchases for under-18s were singled out for praise, and the government now say they will legislate if the rest of the industry doesn’t follow suit.

We got to take a look at some of the roguelite flavour that’s been injected into the expansion’s mostly monochrome open-world. Dress like a mime when you watch the trailer below, so you can silently ooh, ahh and quizzically scratch your head.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. 
Full Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile.

Unsurprisingly, game developers were not pleased. If that wasn't enough, however, Unity CEO John Riccitiello was interviewed by PocketGamer.biz on Wednesday, wherein he called developers who failed to plan monetisation strategies when creating their games were “some of the biggest fucking idiots”.

Grime must be eliminated and I am there to facilitate that request with water and power. But occasionally I succumb to frustration as something I consider pristine isn't determined clean by the little progress bar that usually pats me on the back for jobs well done.
Then I learned that although grime can’t move, it makes up for it with cunning. It cements itself on surfaces in ways you wouldn't expect, as if to belittle my cleaning standards. After many encounters, I've identified this menace as The Underside: a secret boss you'll need to beat to become the ultimate power washer.

But I am absolutely shallow enough to be immediately invested in a game that implies my overarching goal will be to team up with Shohreh Aghdashloo.

Publisher Annapurna Interactive has partnered with cat Travel Cat, a brand of cat travel accessories, to unveil an official line of Stray-branded cat harnesses and backpacks for your real-life kitty.
First up is the harness, a replica of the one worn by Stray’s furry protagonist. It features adjustable chest and neck straps secured by buckles and velcro. The six-foot reflective nylon leash helps owners keep track of their cats in dark alleys while allowing room to explore. You can pre-order it today for $39.99. 

If you’d rather give your cat the royal transportation treatment, the Stray version of Travel Cat’s popular “The Fat Cat” backpack is up your alley. This colorful pack can support up to 25 lbs of feline and is made of breathable, well-ventilated material and a little bubble for the cat to curiously peer at the world. Pre-orders are open now and will set you back $139.99.

You can purchase both items, which are expected to ship later this year, at Travel Cat’s website here.
Stray launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC and stars an orange cat searching for its family in a futuristic neon city inhabited by robots. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here.]]></summary>

The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.]]></summary>

What do a murderous witch, a grandmother’s mysterious death, and demonic possession have in common? An old Polaroid-style camera. Discovering how means braving Madison, an indie horror title that fits within the post-P.T. first-person haunted house mold. Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that’s more than meets the eye. Despite having a strong premise, presentation, and core mechanic, the experience gets bogged down by flawed puzzle de…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.
Survios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens "where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs."
There’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.
This project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.]]></summary>

That's because we're talking about our favourite towers in games. This means we need to draw a distinction between towers (the gamified concept as most popularly complained about in Ubisoft games) and towers (the architectural thing). Luckily, games have a lot of both.
Meanwhile, Nate's fish issue (fisssue?) is growing worse, I am enjoying the local acts performing on the summer bandstand, and we talk about Lord Of The Rings and Lord Of The Rings related things. What fantasy creature would you like to conjure into real-life existence? We both said orc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. 
According to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. 
You can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.
Loyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles." Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. 
These collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  
“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.
PlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels more overdue than surprising, Nintendo acquired animation studio Dynamo Pictures and renamed it Nintendo Pictures. The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. 
According to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: 
"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year."

While certain games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Forces have experimented with new combat mechanics for the games' protagonists to use, Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve that gameplay component in unprecedented ways.
When Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suda51 and his development studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, are the zany minds behind cult classic hits like The Silver Case, Killer 7, No More Heroes, and Lollipop Chainsaw. The hack-and-slash zombie game, Lollipop Chainsaw, might have received lukewarm reviews, but a remake is still on the way. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda took to Twitter today to let avid fans know it'll "be as close as possible to a remaster." You can check out his post below.
ロリポップチェーンソーリメイクに対し沢山のファンよりご質問を頂戴しましたのでお答えします…!!!
#ロリポップチェーンソー#lollipopchainsaw #ドラガミゲームス#dragamigames pic.twitter.com/V6iQG8mVDx
July 12, 2022
In his statement, Yasuda spoke about the primary goal of the remake and the incoming changes:
The original Lollipop Chainsaw was released in 2012 and was about high school cheerleader Juliet and her journey to survival amid a zombie apocalypse in California. For those of you that never played the game, you're right to assume that Juliet donned a flesh-shredding chainsaw. Suda51 and James Gunn (The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy) collaborated on the gory, blood-pumping adventure. Joe Juba reviewed Lollipop Chainsaw and concluded his review by saying:
Are you excited to play the remake? What do you think of the statement? Let us know in the comments below.]]></summary>

Three tiers from cheapest to most expensive – Essential, Extra, and Premium – each offered downloadable games, with the latter two options providing game catalogs in the hundreds. According to the official PlayStation Blog, "the inaugural Game Catalog lineup for the all-new PlayStation Plus" drops for Extra and Premium members this month. Some of the titles include Stray and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade.

Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, one of my favorite games on PlayStation 5, retells the classic steampunk JRPG with a new-gen sheen. You even get to play as world-class ninja Yuffie in her own standalone Intermission Episode. 
The following games are also available on July 19:
Marvel’s Avengers | PS5, PS4
Assassin's Creed Unity | PS4
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag | PS4
Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered | PS4
Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry | PS4
Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection | PS4
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected | PS4
Saints Row Gat out of Hell | PS4
Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition | PS5
Ice Age: Scrat's Nutty Adventure | PS4
Jumanji The Video Game | PS4
Paw Patrol on a Roll! | PS4
ReadySet Heroes | PS4

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last September's Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta's reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. 


Platinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. 

Bayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.]]></summary>

The latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments.

It’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK.

Unlike the kinds of offers you’d find during, say, Black Friday, all the best Prime Day offers are only available to Amazon Prime subscribers.

Tempo RETBLEED není nijak závratné, na AMD Zen 2 (Ryzeny 3000 atd.) jsou data získávána rychlostí 3,9 kB/s, na Intel Coffee Lake (např. Core i7–8700) je to dokonce jen 219 B/s. V tuto chvíli je použitelnost útoku RETBLEED ověřena pro AMD Zen 1, 1+, 2 a Intel Core 6. až 8. generace (Skylake až Coffee Lake).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.


The bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.

One to four players roll their Kirby through four rounds of food-themed obstacle courses, and whoever collects the most strawberries by the end wins. As seen in the trailer, players can use new cuisine-inspired copy abilities to gain the upper hand. That includes morphing into a cupcake that vacuums multiple food items or turning into sentient chocolate bars to perform Kirby’s signature rock slam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. 
By way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot. You can see the tweet below with a translation:
気温が高い場所でNintendo Switchを使用すると、本体の温度が高くなる場合があります。5～35℃の場所で使用してください。
