        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw Creative Assembly's live service heist 'em up Hyenas at last year's Gamescom and came away unimpressed. I thought it was obnoxious and underwhelming, in all the ways you'd expect from a colourful hero shooter whose hook is stealing Sonic merch.
But this year I got to spend a good 30-minutes in a match against other players and have come away… pleasantly surprised. I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch. While it's way too early to make big judgement calls like, "the entire game will be good", it might have more of a chance at launch survival than I thought.

The Electronic Arts developer BioWare - known for famous RPG series such as Baldur's Gate, STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect - has announced it is "eliminating approximately 50 roles" at the studio.
In order to match the changing needs, it will shift towards a "more agile and more focused studio" - allowing developers to iterate quickly, unlock more creativity and form a clear vision of the games being built before development is ramped up. This "extremely difficult" decision will also apparently "preserve the health of the studio" and allow it to focus more on what it does best: "create exceptional story-driven single-player experiences filled with vast worlds and rich characters."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not above being lured in by aesthetic. Draft of Darkness hooked me in with its grainy, pixelated photo manipulation. It looks like a tacky game that followed in the wake of Mortal Kombat. In fact, it would fit right in alongside titles that pushed the limits of tastefulness back in the ‘90s. It’s hypnotic.
In my experience, a well-executed aesthetic can be indicative not necessarily of a game’s quality, but of its inventiveness. Not always, but sometimes. My favorite type of game is one where the developers fucked around and found out. However, that methodology doesn’t always result in an appealing game.
Draft of Darkness is so well-executed in its mechanics that it makes them seem accidental. Aesthetics aside, everything I’ve seen surrounding the game makes it out to be this quiet lit…]]></summary>

At its core, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk wants to remind you how cool other games were. Specifically, Jet Set Radio, Jet Set Radio Future, and a tiny bit of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The problem is, by choosing nostalgia as its sole focus, Bomb Rush lacks an identity of its own – it only reminds me of why I'd rather play those other games instead. 
Bomb Rush attempts to right one of Sega's great crimes: the 21 years we've gone without a new Jet Set Radio game. For the uninitiated, Jet Set was an action sports series that put you in control of a gang of rollerbladers terrorizi…]]></summary>

What do you think a video game called Dome-King Cabbage is about? If you said farming sim, you're wrong. If you said survival game... you're also wrong. The title doesn't really give anything away, but it also gives everything away — it's really darn weird.
Dome-King Cabbage is a visual novel which takes place inside a monster-collecting RPG. Main character Mush is trying to become the 'Dome-King' and, in order to prepare for this job interview, uses their experience in monster-collecting to view the world through the lens of this beloved RPG. The trailer, above, is psychadelic, and it shows off the many strange choices you'll have to make along the way to getting your new job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Playstack and developer 2Awesome have revealed that AK-xolotl will hit consoles and Switch this September. More specifically, the top-down roguelike shooter about a cute but deadly-with-a-gun axolotl will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14. 
The team announced this release date during today’s Future Games Show presentation with a new trailer showing more of the amphibious creature’s violent stroll through the animal kingdom, and it looks great. It features a fun retro throwback visual style and plenty of arcade-like action in combat. 
Check out the AK-xolotl release date trailer for yourself below: 


To coincide with today’s news, a new extended AK-xolotl demo is now live on Steam. Playstack vice president of publishing Rob Crossley says the game’s previously released demo hit almost 70,000 downloads and with player feedback from that demo, 2Awesome has “really managed to expand on some ideas and add a few new really cool features as well.” Some of those new features are present in the new demo, but Crossley says some are being held for the final release. 
AK-xolotl features five unique biomes, each with a variety of enemies, as well as dozens of weapons and power-ups. There are “tons of Axolittles to find and raise” and bosses you’ll love to hate, Playstack says. 

AK-xolotl hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 14.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Crunching Koalas and Developer Label This Studio revealed its psychological thriller, The Gap, last year at the 2022 Future Games Show. Now, the team has returned to this year’s Future Games Show with a new trailer for The Gap and an October release date. 
The Gap will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 19, and preorders for the game are now live. Today’s new trailer is about Maria, who seems to be either the wife of protagonist Joshua Hayes or his daughter. In The Gap, players must explore Joshua’s memories, both of the joyous and heart-wrenching kind, to find a solution to his family’s affliction thanks to a new rare genetic disorder. 
Check out the latest trailer for The Gap for yourself below: 


“Delve deep into the human psyche in The Gap, a psychological thriller that seamlessly weaves together the realms of memories, emotions, and corporate intrigue,” a press release reads. “The game revolves around Joshua Hayes, a dedicated neuroscientist, whose life takes a sudden turn when his family becomes afflicted by a rare genetic disorder. As memories fade and sanity slips away, Joshua is faced with an unimaginable challenge: finding a cure before his family’s essence is forever lost.” 
Here are some screenshots from The Gap:

Publisher North Beach Games via IGN revealed plans to launch cooperative survival game Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria on October 24, 2023.
When Return to Moria first launches it will be available digitally on PlayStation 5 and PC via Epic Games Store. There will also be a physical release for PlayStation 5 on December 5. Beyond that, an Xbox Series X|S version will follow in early 2024.

The deep places of the world
It's been a while since we first heard about Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. Announced back in June 2022, this one is going for a survival twist as players create their own Dwarf before venturing into the treacherous mines. Players will have to craft superior armor and weapons to tough out the challenges that await in the dark and foreboding locale. Your ultimate goal involves recovering treasures and restoring the mines to their former glory, if you can make it out alive.  
Thankfully, there's at least a little bit of safety in numbers. While you can play Return to Moria solo, there's an online multiplayer component that sounds like the main attraction here. It was also previously confirmed that Tolkien scholar Corey Olsen — AKA The Tolkien Professor — is onboard as a consultant. We'll see how sturdy our Dwarves really are when the mines open on October 24.

Updated with the macabre sequel, Blasphemous 2 and the surprising stripped-down experience Bleak Sword DX.

When Dark Souls launched back in 2011, it ushered in a new era of lore-filled and inscrutable combat-focused games that gave players the freedom to follow their own path and play style, but steadfastly refused to 'go easy' on them. Every encounter in FromSoftware's series, no matter how minor, has the potential to end in tears; if you blunder in mindlessly mashing buttons, you will be punished.

It maxes out at 7400MB/s reads and 6500MB/s writes, near the boundary of the PCIe 4.0 standard, and random read/write figures are impressive too despite lacking a DRAM cache, using HMB instead.

The megacorporation has faced pushback from several sources, including Sony. The competitor argues that the acquisition would be anti-competitive, especially if franchises like Call of Duty become Xbox and PC exclusives. Some governing bodies have also stepped in, now prompting Microsoft to revisit its initial agreement.
Previously, Microsoft claimed it was committed to keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation, at least for the next 10 years. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also voted to block the buyout, driving the companies to push back the merger deadline to October 18. Initially, the CMA made its case against the deal over …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Officially revealed back in June, Persona 3 Reload now has a release date. Those looking to dive into the full remake of the PlayStation 2 RPG can mark their calendars for February 2, 2024. If this one has been living rent-free in your head since 2006, you can celebrate its return with the deluxe Aigis Edition.
While we spent some hands-on time with the remake, Atlus shared a new trailer to showcase more of the fresh updates. You can check it out below to see how the overhauled visuals give new life to a fan favorite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax-u7i2_6nQ
If you're curious about the updated music, there's also a trailer highlighting the new battle theme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTdrcvnqDjE
Persona 3 Reload goes beyond tweaks to the visuals and music. Changes have been made to mechanics like Shuffle Time, for instance. The voice cast is also new, including the likes of Zeno Robinson as Junpei Iori, Aleks Le as the protagonist, and more. It looks like a solid mix of modernization and the type of overall faithfulness hardcore Persona fans expect.

Aigis ain't nothin' but a number
In addition to the standard $69.99 digital and physical release and two extra tiers of digital editions — Standard, Digital Deluxe, and Digital Premium — Persona 3 Reload's centerpiece is the Aigis Edition. There's no price at the moment, but this one packs in a bunch of physical and digital bonuses. The game comes in a collector's box along with an art book, two-disc soundtrack CD, and an Aigis figure. All the DLC available at launch will also be included in a DLC pack voucher. You'll be able to grab this one on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. 
Persona 3 Reload is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PC (Steam and Microsoft Store). It also has its sights set on Game Pass, so get ready to evoke in February!

These, of course, being Nvidia's DLSS and Intel's XeSS. Historically, AMD-sponsored video games are usually limited purely to FSR 1.0/2.0, which puts modder PureDark in a unique position.
For context, PureDark is responsible for unofficial implementations of Nvidia DLSS into games that don't support this upscaler by default. This is a huge boon for Nvidia graphics cards owners due to better performance and image quality compared to FSR. The tricky bit, however, is that PureDark has started locking their mods behind a $5 Patreon subscription, and it would seem that they've taken things a step further than ever before by setting up Patreon-based DRM for the…]]></summary>

With the clash between the two primordial forces officially coming to a close and/or cooling off into a state of equilibrium, some Destiny fans may have expected Bungie to go all-out with a new elemental subclass, a new race of enemies to fight, and more. That, however, isn't happening for the most part.
Bungie was never going to meet all of its community's expectations, naturally, but there's a non-insignificant number of very whelmed and indifferent responses to the latest Destiny 2 showcase on the game's subreddit.…]]></summary>

Okay, so before you get too excited, the Starfield x TEMPUR chair isn’t for purchase. It’s one-of-a-kind, and I guess it’s just designed as a way to sell Starfield to butts. It’s going to be at Gamescom 2023, and then it will travel to the “Saturn Xperion store in Germany, before enjoying a month-long residency at the TEMPUR store in Westfield, Stratford.” You’ll need to travel to one of these locations if you want your butt to experience this amazing chair.
The press release goes into a lot of boring information that would probably only interest butts. It’s designed after NASA’s typical space chairs and has a joystick on each armrest (arcade style, for some reason). It swivels, so while it looks like one of those step-in chairs that pull forward, you can just turn it and sit down. That’s pretty cowardly.
I could maybe do without the giant desk, but I would totally be down for a space chair. Gamer chairs these days all look like they were pulled from a sports car, but I want one that goes beyond that. If my apartment suddenly launches skyward, I want to be prepared.
Unfortunately, I can’t buy the Starfield x TEMPUR chair, but I can win it. Before the end of the year, there’s going to be a charity raffle. That’s all the information I have on that, so you’ll need to keep your eyes peeled and your butt prepared.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's so easy to modify Half-Life 2 that it's no wonder Valve's 2004 magnum opus is still part of the gaming scene. However, if you just want the game to look prettier, you can soon run it through Nvidia's RTX Remix tech.
Over on the Nvidia GeForce YouTube channel, you can see a teaser for a revamped version of the iconic Half-Life 2. Side-by-side comparisons show what the OG release looks like when compared to the upcoming remastered version.
https://youtu.be/aM_gzfAMdNs
The Half-Life 2 RTX Remix project actually comes to us via the modding community itself. The description under the trailer says it's being helmed by "four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, now known as Orbifold Studios." Currently, there doesn't appear to be a release date for it.
Ooh, it's so shiny!
The original Half-Life 2 (now fast approaching its 19th birthday) still holds up today. However, a "remixed" version of the classic FPS could bring a visual boost that could breathe new life into it.
The fan-made project will boast full ray tracing for that added dose of lighting goodness, DLSS 3 for graphical upscaling, and a bunch of other tech things that sound fancy.
Nvidia released its RTX Remix as a way for modders to give that certain je ne sais quoi to games that support such modern visual technologies. However, we've also seen it been used to pretty up even older games, like the original Tomb Raider.
You can check out more details on the upcoming Half-Life 2 RTX Remix project by going to Nvidia's website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My history with Armored Core started with the very first game on PlayStation. I was enamored by the cover the enticing giant mech on it; and kept it close while I experienced a whole slate of robot-based oddities like G-Nome, and Heavy Gear. From then on, I sought out every subsequent entry, until I finally put it together that From Software – who had also provided me with hours of entertainment with the King's Field series – was responsible for it all. By the time Demon's Souls came out the studio was a worldwide household name, but they were killing it before Souls changed the industry.
With a pedigree like that, you can see why so many people hold Armored Core in such high regard; so I'm happy to report that Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon keeps that legacy going.

Do you prefer ones that fire straight up and then swoop down like birds of prey, or the kind that jet off to the sides, trapping the target in a pincer formation? How about a single missile that splits into a swarm of smaller missiles? Perhaps a zig-zagger that leaves a trail of explosive charges in its wake, detonating them like dynamite dominoes once it impacts? Well, whatever your fancy, Armored Core VI has a loadout for every occasion. With as many combinations as Dolly Parton's wardrobe, it’s almost a scandal to equip the same gear twice.

As a member of the niche mech-action genre, Armored Core has been out of commission for some time. The last entry in the series was a full 10 years ago, and since then, developer From Software’s other titles (Elden Ring, Bloodborne, etc.) have made the developer a household name. Now, the studio has returned with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (ACVI), applying many lessons from its other action games. Armored Core VI doesn’t revolutionize the mech game formula but refines it to create one of the genre's…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aperture Desk Job is full of unexplained details. Right at the start, as the camera pans down from the retrofuturist reception area to your lowly desk-based workstation, we see all manner of orange tubes, future Grady cores being trained to fool captcha image tests, a giant chicken, and what appears to be the origin point of Half-Life's ammo boxes being constructed. But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. 
On its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing?

Developed in Finland, Afterdream is currently on show at Gamescom. This psychological horror adventure gives you a camera to explore an old mansion — but nothing is as it seems. The trailer covers the unique pixel art in swathes of mist, and the narration is just chilling enough to make us reconsider ever going to sleep ever again.

Accompanied by a more "floaty" and orchestral version of Elton John's "Rocket Man" (because of course), the footage shows a heroic-looking astronaut who gifts a young girl a badge bearing the Starfield logo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek3I6_9c58E
He then jettisons off into space, flying among the cosmos, hope and awe in his eyes. Then some brief pew-pew-pew-ing before he finds himself touching grass (or...dust, in this case) on a new planet.
I would have chosen Babylon Zoo's "Spaceman," personally
As if Starfield needed any more hype. This is Bethesda's newest IP in 25 years, and it's easily one of the most anticipated video games of this generation. While there's already been some criticism towards the game's main menu, many are excited about Starfield.
Still, this live action trailer does have a certain "epic" quality about it, if you'll pardon the cliché. If nothing else, it gives Microsoft a chance to flex its Big Budget muscles.
If, for some reason, you haven't committed the date to memory, Starfield will be launching on September 6 for Xbox Series X|S exclusive and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, PlayStation revealed a dedicated handheld remote play device that puts one half of a DualSense controller on each side of an LCD screen. However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.

The PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” 
The PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. 

PSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. 
PlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.]]></summary>

A self-described "clay artist with a love of Pikmin," Twitter user ZatchMehr is trying to eventually locate and acquire every in-game Pikmin 4 treasure in real life. They've noted that they started their quest roughly three days after the game came out, and it's taken them about a month to get this far.
If you're curious, they've even been chronicling their journey with tweets of individual collections, in a near 1:1 recreation of the in-game collection screenshots:

Newly Nostalgic
As a reminder Pikmin 4 has 239 treasures (that are uniquely designed): so there's still a ways to go.
https://twitter.com/ZatchMehr/status/1694121307129127421
How many treasures do you have?
In terms of the electronic stuff, I own that exact Wavebird, the small Game and Watch portable, the GameCube Wave Race disc, the SNES mouse, the red/blue Switch Joy-Con set, and that blue GBA SP. It was a blast going through Pikmin 4 and pointing at the screen like that Leo meme: the idea of collecting Earthly "treasures" during your adventure is genius.
The attention to detail is impressive, as some of these items are exact replicas, and many come as close as humanly possible without resorting to making a Pikmin-specific Etsy store. As for the food items, ZatchMehr explains that "fake fruit comes in clutch," so don't worry about it spoiling!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios has been hard at work bringing us remasters and remakes of classic FPS games from a bygone era. We've already had revamped versions of the first two Quake games, and now the developer is bringing back Star Wars: Dark Forces.
In a recent trailer on the studio's YouTube channel, Nightdive will be collaborating with Lucasfilm Games (formerly LucasArts) to create a remaster of the mid-90's Star Wars title.
https://youtu.be/4b9TTurkH4c
The trailer (which demonstrates alpha footage) shows off some of the work so far. You'll definitely want to check out the renewed cut scenes. Much like previous projects done by Nightdive, it'll still look and feel like Dark Forces, but will be given a modern lift with 4K visuals, plus "advanced 3D rendering, modern gamepad support, trophies and achievements, and more."
The (dark) force is strong in this one
The original game was released all the way back in 1995, and was the first in the Jedi Knight series. It was developed on the aptly named Jedi engine, which is a toolkit that shares similarities with Build, the engine that powered the likes of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior. Nightdive's remaster of the ancient Star Wars game will utilize the KEX engine instead, which the studio has used in a number of projects, including for the Quake remaster.
We recently got treated to a modern version of Quake 2, which improved the graphics (particularly in the lighting department) while also adding quality-of-life changes and the DLC.
At the moment, we don't know when Star Wars: Dark Forces will be coming out, but it's set to release on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

        <updated>2023-08-23T12:38:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios has announced that the N64 version of Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion will be among the next games to get the remaster treatment. Not only that, it already has a release date of November 14 and is coming to PC and consoles.
Originally released in 2000, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion was an interesting turn for Acclaim’s Turok series. It really shows the awkward evolution of the first-person shooter genre in the wake of 1998’s Half-Life. While the first two games were largely just fast-paced key-hunting games like early FPS, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion incorporated more story elements and cutscenes. It involved two would-be Turoks trying to fight back against an encroaching threat in the wake of Joshua Fireseed’s apparent death.
https://youtu.be/SdCaj5ZRp-A
It’s the last numbered Turok entry and, really, the last good one. The level design kind of gets mired in the muddy brown industrial look of the late ‘90s, and the action isn’t as swift as the earlier titles. A lot of the real Turok identity gets lost in the pursuit of gaming trends. Despite that, it’s an interesting early-3D game.
While Nightdive previously remastered the first two Turok games, a rerelease of Shadow of Oblivion wasn’t guaranteed. The first two titles already had PC ports that the studio could work off of, whereas Turok 3 never left the N64. However, since they were able to “reverse engineer” and provide the N64 campaign of Quake 2, I had hoped that they put in the effort because they were working on a port to Turok 3. And sure enough…
Does this mean we'll get Turok: Rage Wars someday?
Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion is getting the KEX Engine treatment. Nightdive is boasting a lot of the same enhancements that the Quake 2 remaster received, including real-time lighting and updated models. It’s coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch on November 14.

If collecting all of the treasures in Pikmin 4 hasn't scratched your collecting itch, then you should take a leaf out of clay artist and Pikmin fan Zatch Mehr's book.
Mehr has given himself the task of collecting every treasure you can find in Pikmin 4 — but in real life. Sharing his progress on Twitter so far, Mehr has already gathered together a huge amount of treasures. Simple, everyday items like candles, a water bowl, and golf balls are fairly easy to come by, but we can't imagine that specific octopus toy was easy to come across.

During a CEDEC Awards panel in Japan, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet developer Game Freak has revealed an early piece of concept art from the latest mainline entries, showcasing the team's initial approach in regards to the project's visuals.
As relayed by Serebii's Joe Merrick, Game Freak had conceptualised an idea called "real and deformed", in which the background and environment of the game would be more realistic than than the previous games (Sword and Shield), while the Pokémon and human characters would take on a more stylised look.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tencent are bringing back NovaLogic's venerable tactical FPS series Delta Force. Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.


The original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights.

Jumanji: Wild Adventures follows on from the 2019 title Jumanji: The Video Game and aims to be "bigger and wilder". The first game is reportedly the publisher's biggest-selling title to date, and we're not surprised to see them capitalising on the hugely popular modern films.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revealed last night at Gamescom 2023's Opening Night Live, we now know that Little Nightmares 3 is indeed a thing, coming in 2024. It's being made by Supermassive Games, who specialise in horror games (although not quite the same as the nitty-gritty childhood terrors style of Little Nightmares). Following the trajectory of the previous two games, Little Nightmares the third has two controllable protagonists, so you can play in co-op. It also has a tie-in podcast, to build out some of the Little Nightmares lore, a thing you might not have known existed.

Now, two and a half years following the release of the last mainline entry, fans of the first two critically acclaimed games have something new to be excited for. Bandai Namco has announced that Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games is developing a new entry in the Little Nightmares universe. Not only that, but we got our first look at Little Nightmares III.
Little Nightmares III gives players the story of Low and Alone, two children trapped within The Spiral, which is a cluster of disturbing places, and they need to work together to escape from a threat that is lurking in the shadows. Little Nightmares III is still playable as a single-player with a CPU-controlled partner, but you can also…]]></summary>

It wasn’t until I sat down to write this that I realized how wild the Persona brand has gotten. I mean, sure, every big brand has to have a Musou eventually. And you can see the RPG throughline that connects Persona with the Etrian Odyssey-style Persona Q. But a fighting game set in the Persona universe? A collection of rhythm games based on Persona soundtracks? The crazy part is, no matter what direction Persona spinoffs take, they always seem to land strong and find fans. Heck, I know a guy who’s chomping at the bit for a Persona 5 fighting game, even though he’s since graduated to fighters like Guilty Gear and Street Fighter.

Originally released in 2006 (2007 in North America), Persona 3 marks the start of the “modern” Persona series. Sure, the first games featured students summoning demons like they’re Pokémon. But your social links, life sim elements, and more – that all started with Persona 3. I know many who still consider it a series high, but honestly, Persona 3 has always been a bit hard to come back to. On PS2, the game is missing essential quality of life, such as being able to even control your own party members. And while the PSP version fixes some of this, it comes with the caveat of feeling very much like a condensed PSP game.

This summer’s announcement of Mortal Kombat 1 brought with it a new era for the long-running fighting franchise. The latest game from NetherRealm Studios brings the outstanding fighting mechanics the series has been known for since the 2011 reboot, but adds layers of complexity. The most notable addition to the core mechanics in this entry is perhaps the Kameo feature, where you can bring in a secondary character to perform a quick move at a crucial time in a fight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 is the biggest D&D video game the world has ever seen. It has brought countless new players to the genre, many of whom likely got absolutely hooked and have already done everything there is to do in the game — despite that likely requiring up to 200 hours of playtime. If you're one of these heroes, maybe you could find some use in a list of masterpieces of old and new that capture the same magic as 2023's biggest game.

Though it features a great mix of combat, enemies, and magic spells, what set Planescape Torment apart was its focus on story and character development. The developers took quite the gamble when they decided to make a game that was more focus…]]></summary>

Even though there was mention of more "open ended" COD missions, the one shown certainly seemed like any vintage, largely linear COD level.

And thus, a new Snyderverse is born. Not that they showed us said game, mind, or really told us anything about it. It will be set after both Rebel Moon films, though, so you better get watching if you want to know what the hell is going on. Honestly, did we learn nothing from Final Fantasy 15's failed multimedia project mistakes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gamescom Opening Night Live we got to see the first official gameplay trailer for Crimson Desert. It's no surprise, but the gameplay looks like a revamped and enhanced version of the combat from Black Desert Online.
The war-torn and medieval fantasy world of Pywel looks absolutely beautiful, and I can't wait to explore it. Not to mention about halfway through the trailer we get to see some quality fishing gameplay. Why can't every game have fishing? In the video the player caught a nice sized Barracuda that looked like it could be consumed to replenish 150 HP.
Despite how beautiful and honestly polished the open-world action-adventure title looked, there was no release date or timeframe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdmoGYg8tB0
We first saw Crimson Desert during the 2020 Game Awards. It's been in development for quite some time now by developer Pearl Abyss, creator of Black Desert Online. It was originally announced as an MMORPG but by the end of 2020 Pearl Abyss announced that was no longer the case. Instead, Crimson Desert will intertwine a single-player and multiplayer experience.
Despite its many flaws—and abhorrent pay-to-win mechanics,—Black Desert Online has one of the best combat systems ever in an MMORPG. Seeing Crimson Desert utilize an even more enhanced version of the combat system has me excited to try it out.
There is no release date yet for Crimson Desert, but we do know it is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

Sure, the dynamic mud of driving sim Spintires was impressive to look at, and it also gave us a game where driving two metres through a puddle could become a serious puzzle. So I'm certainly interested in today's announcement of Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, this time sending us off-roading to conduct science. Well, if the mud doesn't blind me, the science surely will.

Red Thread Games, who made Draugen (a horror game I liked quite a bit), are adding to the list with Dustborn, a single-player action-adventure with a heavy lean towards story, which was revealed at this year's Gamescom Opening Night Live.
You play Pax, a pregnant con-artist on the run transporting an important package across the Northern border of what appears to be an authoritarian, dystopian USA. And you tell me this is in no way related to Road 96? Well, alright. Dustborn is being published by Quantic Dream, so I feel dutybound to make fun of it. No. Must... resist...

It wasn’t anything glamorous, but I got the opportunity during one of the lowest points in my life. COVID was in full swing, and I had lost my job. It helped me hold onto a shred of self-worth for a while. I faded off shortly after, but I enjoyed the time I spent collaborating with them.
I didn’t work on WrestleQuest, though. The closest I came was when I was asked if it looked like one of the crowd members was flipping the middle finger. I didn’t even remember that until I noticed that same crowd member.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gamescom 2023, Blizzard revealed Season 2 for Diablo 4: Season of Blood. It looks like Blizzard will be following the originally promised quarterly release schedule for Diablo 4 seasons. Season of Blood will release on October 17, almost exactly three months after Season of the Malignant.
After a pretty lackluster Season 1, hopefully Season of Blood adds more meaningful content, especially in the end-game of Diablo 4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF65c670lpM
The announcement trailer didn't give us much information, other than that we'll be accompanying a new character named Erys. Erys is voiced by actress and producer Gemma Chan and leads the effort against a deadly new evil in Sanctuary. Based on the trailer, the new evil seems to be some blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures with extremely pointy teeth.
At the end of the trailer, we get a few quick glimpses of new features coming in Season of Blood. A new questline, new vampiric powers—which will probably replace the existing malignant hearts—and five new endgame bosses. Honestly, the endgame bosses could be pretty exciting, as that's currently a lacking feature of Diablo 4 compared to other ARPGs like Path of Exile.
Also, it appears we'll be getting updates to renown rewards, gem and stash storage, and resistances and status effects. Without concrete details it's hard to know how exactly to feel. But, all of these sound like good things, so I'm excited to find out more.
Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, will release on all platforms on October 17.

It was good ridiculousness. Now Payday 3 is on its way, and the cooperative heisting looks far more down-to-Earth in a new trailer fresh out of Gamescom.

The footage is then followed by gameplay showing combat with dual protagonists Saga Anderson and, of course, Alan Wake. It's all very spooky.
The footage was brief, but to see it yourself, check out the trailer below:

https://youtu.be/nr4lA4N9lFU
At this point, I thought we'd seen the entire roster, but it looks like that isn't the case. Both the legendary Mortal Kombat boss Shao Kahn and his Queen, Sindel, have been shown off.  We also get a closer look at a younger, spunkier Raiden. Mortal Kombat 3 sub-boss Motaro also appears as a pretty awesome-looking Kameo. Uh, I think I know who I'm picking.
You know, If Liu Kang was trying to remake the universe to be a more peaceful and prosperous place to live, I'm not sure why he'd bring back Shao Kahn. At least now, he seems to exist beneath the heel of Sindel, which is a bit of a flip.
Uhh, so does this mean there's still a chance that I'll get Sheeva? Please?
Mortal Kombat 1 comes out September 19, 2023 to PC, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.

The Geoffcom mega show also revealed there's a new mage class called the Runemaster heading to the game next month that's capable of casting 40 different spells on a single attack key, but given this is the first time we've written about Last Epoch, I realise that probably won't mean much to a lot of you. So let's back up a bit and introduce Last Epoch properly, because hoo boy, if you love customisable skill trees, this is the ARPG for you, my friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a brand new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1, and it’s one of the wildest ones yet. It confirms that both Sindel and General Shao are playable characters, and we get another look at Liu Kang’s chosen champion, Raiden. 
The trailer begins with a cinematic cutscene setting up the ensuing fight as Liu Kang challenges Sindel to a duel by way of Raiden. It doesn’t take long for the trailer to become a gory mess of blood and guts, though, as we see Sindel, General Shao, and Raiden face off in various fights. The trailer also reveals two additional Kameo fighters: Motaro and Shujinko. 
Check out the Rulers of Outworld Mortal Kombat 1 trailer for yourself below: 


"As supreme ruler of Outworld’s army, General Shao has proven loyalty to his realm through countless victories in battle and possesses a gameplay style that dominates opponents with conquering strength and iron will," a press release reads. "Sindel is the empress of Outworld who fights to protect her family and empire with the ability to vanquish enemies with her mystifying hair, piercing scream, and power of levitation." 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.

They'll be going up against the Stormcast Eternals alongside the Orruk Kruleboyz in the game's campaign, and I got to see them in action ahead of tonight's showcase. And I can confirm: they're a nasty bunch of spectral rags, this lot, especially when they pile on in large numbers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live trailer, CD Projekt Red showed off some of the upgrades that are coming to the Cyberpunk 2077 base game and its expansion, Phantom Liberty.
Most of this stuff was already shown off, but it's some appreciable features. The perk system is getting overhauled, new weapons and vehicles are being added, and a number of systems and mechanics are getting brushed up. Not all of it looks completely revolutionary, but they did give a peak at the upgraded police system and showed off vehicular weaponry. Both of which I think will definitely improve the moments between narrative.
https://youtu.be/zBrkG3aeWCc
They're also finally implementing a Relic upgrade screen. It was viewable on the base game, but for whatever reason, it wasn't implemented. When I played through, I was saving upgrade points for when it would eventually unlock, but I got impatient and looked it up and found out that there wasn't a talent tree for it. What a tease.
There are a few other bullet points that sound interesting, including an increased level cap, upgraded combat AI, and redesigned cyberware. I'm hoping that you can now have more visible cyberware, but I'm not holding my breath. I thought Cyberpunk 2077 was a bit up its own ass when it came to showing off its production values, but I'm still looking forward to the expansion.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty expansion releases on September 26, 2023. Even if you're not interested in the new narrative, the Update 2.0 overhauls will be incorporated for free into the base version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year we saw the first gameplay trailer for Flashback 2, and now our hero Conrad B. Hart is back for more. With Gamescom underway, a new trailer is here to show off more of the sequel's action and intrigue.
Flashback 2 has original creator Paul Cuisset teaming up with developer Microids Studio Lyon to put players back in the role of the young GBI agent, and this new trailer shows more of how the new release differs from the 1992 original. Previously confined to methodical side-scrolling movement and quick and deadly gunplay, Conrad's freedom has expanded. You can see the 2.5D potion in motion as Conrad rolls, jumps, and shoots below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7ei5RIgyzI
Hangin' tough
Flashback 2 has other original team members on board in addition to Cuisset. This includes Thierry Perreau on game design and Amiga composer Raphael Gesqua. 
While it looks like a faster-paced take on the classic, it's nice to see Flashback 2 clinging to cinematic adventure game animations. The way Conrad hangs from ledges and performs all-important combat rolls should look familiar enough to longtime fans. Sure, they may have misspelled "Washington" in one of the cinematics, but it looks like a lot of care was put into bringing the battle against the Morphs to 2023.
Flashback 2 spins its dystopian sci-fi yarn on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 16. It's going physical and digital on consoles, too, and the Collector's Edition packs in some extras for those who want to shout their Flashback love from the heart of their shelves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Snap took fans of both the popular comics and movies company and collectible card games by storm last year thanks to its bite-sized, exciting gameplay and compelling collection and leveling-up mechanics. Both the mobile and Early Access PC versions have received various updates that include a Conquest series mode, friend PvP, and a ton of new cards and variants, but the PC version has remained in Steam Early Access until now.
However, during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase, developer Second Dinner Studios' Ben Brode announced that Marvel Snap has exited Steam Early Access and is officially out now on PC. To celebrate, players who log into the PC version of Marvel Snap will receive a Devil Dinosaur Mech Variant. Additionally, players who watch the Marvel Snap category on Twitch will be eligible for drops starting today and running until August 29. 
"Launching the game on PC has been a dream of ours for years now, and we've worked really hard to ensure it's an experience that players new and old are going to absolutely love," Brode said in a press release. "This is especially an exciting time for the streaming community, who have welcomed Marvel Snap with open arms. The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC and we can't wait to see the epic streams on Twitch now that we're live."
The PC version includes a native widescreen format. You can see the animated reveal trailer debuted during today's livestream below.


Marvel Snap was so well-received in 2022 that it was a rare free-to-play mobile title to land on Game Informer's Top 10 Games of the Year list.

But during tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, we got our first proper look at this demonic alien faction, as well as three of the units that will be at our disposal on release. And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault. It's kinda gross, but also weirdly rad? In any case, I'm into it.

The new date's trailer also showed off a few of Cygames' extra goodies, including a Deluxe and Collector's Edition. The beefier of the two includes a Proto Bahamut statue.

So far, Cygames has confirmed several familiar faces from its gacha hit for Relink. We've seen series hero Lyria and her bodyguard, Katalina. The swordswoman Narmaya, dragonslayer Siegfried, ghostly Ferry, and, of course, both designs for the mobile version's silent player avatar. As you adventure with old and new series companions, players can invite a friend along for the ride; the GBF action game supports up to four players for co-op.

It's been a long wait for folks eager to see some of their favorite 2D heroes get the full-fledged action RPG treatment. Relink's first announcement goes all the way back to 2016. That's back when we knew it as "Project Re: Link," instead. After some developer limbo, a period of silence, and a change in studio involvement, we're finally getting there. Back in May, Relink made another appearance at the PlayStation showcase with its 2023 release window.
Pre-orders for the GBF RPG open on August 23, 2 am CEST. Granblue Fantasy: Relink launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom 2023 has had quite a few vague "this exists" trailers, and Killing Floor 3 is one of them.
Look, I really dig the staying power of the Killing Floor series. The second game in particular remained relevant for several years after its initial 2016 debut, well into its release on Xbox One a year later. It's a great take on the typical horde mode formula, and Tripwire Interactive spawned an entire diehard audience out of it. Now, a third entry is in the works.
If you're interested, here's a synopsis from Tripwire to hold you over:
"Killing Floor 3 is the next installment in the legendary co-op action/horror FPS series. The year is 2091, 70 years after the events in Killing Floor 2, and megacorp Horzine has produced the ultimate army: an obedient horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. Now, the only thing standing between these infernal creations and the future of humanity is the rebel rogue group known as Nightfall. This intense first-person shooter puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, joining forces with up to five teammates as they battle through a war-ravaged, dystopian future, surviving unrelenting waves of Zeds, unlocking new skills, and building the ultimate arsenal."

Okay, an even more futuristic take on the series? I can work with that! It sounds like we could get even more lore tidbits this time around, with the clash between Nightfall and Horzine.
Killing Floor 3 will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S for sure (with no prior generation console releases planned): but it currently has no release date, or even a release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known for a while now that Destiny 2 developer Bungie has been bringing players closer and closer to the end of the War of Light and Darkness. Now, the studio has formally unveiled The Final Shape, the expansion concluding this decade-long story arc, and it launches on February 27, 2024. 
Bungie says in The Final Shape, Guardians will confront their ultimate adversary, The Witness, alongside companions from their years of adventures in Destiny 2, like Ikora Rey, Commander Zavala, and Cayde-6, who has somehow returned after dying in the game’s Forsaken expansion. The Final Shape will take players right into the heart of the Traveler to end the War of Light and Darkness with the Vanguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Frontiers was released late last year, it was generally regarded as good but "rough around the edges." Because of that, it's been great to see Sega move to support the game further post-launch with a series of updates with free content. Teased today at Gamescom, the next pack of content, known as "The Final Horizon" update, is the most exciting yet, promising new story, new challenges, and even new playable characters.


The teaser itself doesn't give us much to go on. Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there's no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.
For any more details, we'll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now. If you're itching for more Sonic news, check out the latest issue of our digital magazine to learn about Sonic Superstars. You can also learn about its newly announced release date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog made sure to show up at Gamescom 2023, and with that came a treat for those who bought Sonic Frontiers. A short teaser trailer for an update called "The Final Horizon" was unveiled, promising new story, new playable characters, and new challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMbtrz3ut9w
The trailer itself isn't terribly illuminating on its own. We see a giant robot looking down on Sonic and friends, which goads Sonic into taking out some Chaos Emeralds. As a hedgehog naturally does, he goes Super Sonic shortly after, and the teaser ends. This might mean something to those who played Sonic Frontiers, I just didn't join Destructoid fast enough to cover it. That said, I know that Super Sonic always warrants celebration, so I'm excited for that!
Though details on The Final Horizon remain scarce, we do know it will release for free. While Sonic Frontiers remains a somewhat divisive game, I'm happy that fans of the title will get a nice bonus for their loyalty. I'll be plenty curious to see how this update pans out when it launches on September 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflexion Games revealed during Gamescom that Nightingale would be getting one more final delay. The survival crafting adventure will now release in Early Access on February 22, 2024.
Despite the delay, we also get an official release date trailer that shows off some more gameplay. I have to admit, the procedurally-generated Victorian universe is looking better than ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dcRqDhVVV8
"After years of dedicated work from the team, we are thrilled to announce that Nightingale will enter Early Access on February 22nd, 2024," CEO Aaryn Flynn said in a press release. "That date is a few months later than we previously announced. But as a studio, we’re committed to quality, and we take player satisfaction very seriously. We want to ensure that the game delivers on the expectations of our community, who have played a vital role in the development to date. We strive to ensure that Nightingale not only fulfills our vision but also becomes a cherished place for our players to explore and discover with their friends for many years to come."

With this trailer being titled "Official Release Date Trailer", surely this has to be the last delay, right? I've been very excited about Nightingale since its announcement. I'm a huge fan of these open-world survival crafting games, especially with Nightingale spanning multiple worlds. It has the potential to be a truly unique experience in the genre.
Nightingale will now release in Early Access on Steam and Epic on February 22, 2024 at a pricepoint of$29.99

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We already knew that Sonic Superstars was arriving this fall, but thanks to today's Gamescom Opening Night Live stream, we know exactly when. In a month that already features the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Forza Motorsport, and Cities: Skylines II, we have another high-profile game that will contend with our precious free time. Sonic Superstars joins the mix with a release date of October 17.
Sonic Superstars brings the Classic Sonic action into a more modernized setting with 3D visuals and myriad new powers. It's also the first Sonic game to feature true cooperative play. As our most recent cover story, we've played and talked a lot about Sonic Superstars, including an exclusive look at every Emerald Power in the game, plus a first look at several never-before-seen zones.
This announcement also brought us a look at other multiplayer modes, which you can see in the trailer below.


Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17. That date puts it the same week as another highly anticipated 2D game from one of gaming's most fabled and beloved franchises, as Super Mario Bros. Wonder arrives on October 20. We already knew this fall and holiday season would be fantastic for gamers, but it looks to be particularly awesome for fans of 2D platforming. For more on Sonic Superstars, be sure to hit the banner below for exclusive details surrounding the highly anticipated 2D adventure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LG's 27GL850 was a legendary monitor, as this 27-inch model was the first to use the Korean chaebol's Fast IPS panels - which combined the extremely fast pixel response times you'd expect to see on TN panels with the wide viewing angles and gorgeous colours of IPS screens. This combination proved popular, and today there's a deal on the modern successor to the 27GL850 - the 27GP850. 
The 27GP850 is down to $299.99 at Amazon, versus an original price of $429.99. We saw a lot of sales on the 1440p 144Hz 27GL850 when it reached this price, so seeing an even better 1440p 180Hz model at the same point could result in quite a popular pickup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom Opening Night Live provided a platform for a new gameplay walkthrough of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The video focuses on a new wrinkle called Open Combat Missions. These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.
You can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. 
Similar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pearly Abyss, the studio behind Black Desert Online, has released a new trailer for its upcoming single-player open-world RPG, Crimson Desert, and it features our first look at new gameplay since 2020. 
The studio released this trailer as part of Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live presentation for Gamescom, and it features new 4K footage of protagonist Kliff investigating the region of Hernand. It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. 
Check out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. 
“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” 

Pearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. 
For more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2023/2023/08/22/black-myth-wukong-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-showcasing-its-action-rpg"/>
        <updated>2023-08-22T18:05:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Game Science has released a new trailer for Black Myth: Wukong. Revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony today, Black Myth: Wukong continues to look great.
Today’s trailer showcases more of the game’s action RPG combat alongside its dive into Chinese mythology. The combat looks reminiscent of From Software’s Sekiro and this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty from Team Ninja, but it’s clear it’s aiming for its own take on the fast-paced action combat. 
You can check out the Black Myth: Wukong trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Black Myth: Wukong pits the player’s monkey warrior character – the Destined One – against various legends, foes, and creatures from throughout Chinese mythology, and it looks fun (and difficult). Game Science says Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on Journey to the West, one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. “You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.” 
Today’s trailer did not reveal anything by way of a release date for the game, but it’s due out sometime in the summer of next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glance at a Fort Solis screenshot and you might summarise it as "Dead Space if it were set in a moodier corner of Ridley Scott flick The Martian". The correct bundle of analogies is actually "Tacoma if it was made by Supermassive Games or Quantic Dream - and also, if it were set in a moodier corner of Ridley Scott flick The Martian". If you're unfamiliar with all of those things, here's the translation: this is a creepy but seldom scary mystery-horror game about a couple of engineers exploring an abandoned spacebase full of quick-time events (aka, "push the button before the prompt vanishes") and audio/video diaries from the Project X Proceeds Apace School of Ominous Backstory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gamescom's Opening Night Live event, CD Projekt Red shared a new trailer and took to the stage to share what is coming to Cyberpunk 2077 with its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty expansion. Phantom Liberty is a paid expansion that will include all kinds of new story content and Idris Elba, but even if you don't buy into the expansion, the game will receive all kinds of improvements.


The footage from the game showed protagonist V launching herself from a motorcycle to slam into a group of enemies. New weapons, like guns and blades will be added and perks have been redesigned. There are also all kinds of new animations in the combat. We also saw V throwing an enemy at another in combat and dashing in mid-dair. The police have also been revamped and will call in MaxTac to fight you, you can hack while driving, and new vehicles will have built in guns for expanded car combat.
The 2.0 update releases September 26 and the paid Phantom Liberty expansion will also be available that day. You can find Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review by following the link.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyper Light Breaker, the upcoming action title by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine, has been delayed. It was set to launch in Steam Early Access later this year, but the team needs more time to bring it together.
As such, the game will now launch early next year. A developer video simply informs fans of the team’s desire to spend more time with Hyper Light Breaker, with creative director Alx Preston stating in a press release, 
“We've made remarkable progress and the game has come a long way since we started development. Taking this additional time to focus on Hyper Light Breaker’s development will allow us to bring the game to its full potential and we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community that’s been with us every step of the way. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to deliver a new adventure that lives up to what fans expect from a Heart Machine title.”


Hyper Light Breaker is a spiritual follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, set within the same universe but imagined in 3D graphics. The third-person action game can be played alone or with friends in 3-player online co-op. Players roam the large, colorful world discovering new areas, battling monsters in flashy combat, and obtaining powerful gear in a quest to overthrow a powerful king. To learn more about the game, check out our April interview with Preston about the reveal of one of the game’s minibosses.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all of Supergiant’s games, I feel like Pyre is the odd duck out. Bastion, Transistor, and Hades - all fit nicely into the action-RPG genre (as well as all being absolute bangers) but Pyre is something else entirely. Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).
The rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.

“After Replaced's initial announcement in 2021 and its follow-up trailer in 2022 we had this incredibly high bar of community's expectations,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. “And at this point, we knew that we can't afford to release a sub-par game. We truly want Replaced to be something special and memorable for everybody. This is our first game, and we want to make every aspect of it the best it can be.”

        <updated>2023-08-22T14:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the 1983 video game crash and Nintendo’s subsequent takeover of the industry with the NES, the Atari 2600 reigned supreme. The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. 
Atari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. 


The 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:
Adventure
Combat
Dodge ‘Em
Haunted House
Maze Craze
Missle Command
Realsports Volleyball
Surround
Video Pinball
Yar’s Revenge
“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”
The Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.]]></summary>

This incoming mod for the seminal 2004 FPS will, in the style of Portal with RTX, rejig the original game with modern technical goodies like ray tracing, updated environmental details, and Nvidia Reflex support. DLSS will also be on hand to absorb the inevitably mahoosive performance hit from bouncing all those rays around, and that includes DLSS 3, provided you have a compatible graphics card.
It’s being developed by a collective of experienced HL2 modders, Orbifold Studios, without direct input from Valve. No release date yet, as Half-Life 2 RTX – or to use its full name, Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project – is still in the early stages. There is a teaser trailer, though.

After the CMA blocked Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion back in April over cloud gaming concerns, Microsoft set its sights on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for approval. In July, a California judge denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft’s proposed acquisition. Shortly after that decision, Microsoft announced it was pausing its appeal efforts in the U.K. to negotiate with the CMA, and the CMA extended the company’s deadline to do so to August 29, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an attempt to appease the UK’s Competition And Markets Authority (CMA), Microsoft have restructured their proposed Activision Blizzard buyout. Should the deal finally close, cloud streaming rights to existing and future Activision Blizzard games released over the next 15 years will (surprisingly) fall under Ubisoft’s control. Those rights will then stay with Ubisoft “in perpetuity.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone whose auto-battler experience has, up until now, only been limited to minor forays into the excellent Alice0-recommended Super Auto Pets, sitting down to play a run of Tales & Tactics was somewhat overwhelming. Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire's popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you'll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. 
It's an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there's maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That's not to say I haven't had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I'm fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum is making me wonder whether there’s some kind of gigantic hidden market for floaty magic shooters with overcooked YA dialogue and exceedingly high PC hardware demands. After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his 'tache.
Indeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.

Plenty of great first-person shooters take players on globe-trotting adventures using modern military technology, to World Wars, and sometimes the moon or even hell. Immortals of Aveum carves out its own place in the broad genre of shooters by setting its first-person action in the fantasy realm of Aveum, and it’s refreshing to shoot at ax-wielding knights, magic sorcerers, dragons, and more. 
It helps that Immortals of Aveum mixes up its competent shooting with unique, puzzle-like twists to keep most encounters fresh and ex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A challenge: hold your arm at a right angle to your torso, bent at the elbow so you can see your wrist and hand in the corner of your eye. Keep it there for as long as you can. Hurts after a while, huh? This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.
Despite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.

This authentication mechanism is what in turn has led to the GeForce GTX 700 series still being the best supported series by the open-source Nouveau driver while the GTX 900 series and later have been crippled to their low boot clock speeds due to PMU/re-clocking restrictions. While Nouveau developers have been working on the GPU System Processor (GSP) approach for RTX 20 "Turing" GPUs and newer to workaround this limitation as NVIDIA's blessed path forward, the NVIDIA BIOS Signature Lock has now been broken by Windows modders...]]></summary>

These wraps work similarly to Sony’s PlayStation 5 console covers, allowing players to change the console’s cosmetic look without buying an entirely new one. Instead of sliding covers off like with the PS5, Xbox’s solution is to wrap the cosmetic change around the console, hence the name. The company has revealed three wraps to kick off the product, including a special edition Starfield wrap. 
“The Starfield-inspired console wrap reimagines your console as an on-board avionics module, powering you through your adventures,” an Xbox blog post reads. “Key internal console components are highlighted through outlined access panel and game-inspired graphics.

Madden NFL 24 from EA Tiburon expands on the rebuilt fundamentals from last year, creating a football simulation that takes a solid next step toward authenticity. However, new poorly implemented features and an interface showing its age are enough of a drag to make this latest iteration feel like a step back for a series badly in need of forward progress.
The on-the-field gameplay is more realistic than ever. The physics-based player interactions are noticeably improved, with ball carriers pushing against piles…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When listing off my favourite games, I'm shamefully likely to neglect to mention Firewatch. This is probably because Firewatch isn't a game that had some huge formative impact on me, or reframed my entire relationship with gaming, or became an enduring obsession of my hyperfixation-prone brain. Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.
I think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.
Don't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Invincible will be released this November. 
More specifically, publisher 11 bit studios and developer Starward Industries have revealed that its upcoming sci-fi mystery game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6. Starward Industries has released a new trailer highlighting this release date as well as new footage of the game, and you can watch it below: 


In The Invincible, players control Yasna, an astrobiologist in search of her lost crew that she must bring back dead or alive. They’re lost somewhere on the Mars-like planet of Regis III.
“On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn’t mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers,” a press release reads.
Starward Industries says the philosophical nature of what happens to Yasna on Regis III will have her forever questioning “the scale of humankind’s ambitions.” 

The Invincible is based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel of the same name, which mixes “retro-futuristic and atompunk design and aesthetics” to create a poppy art style. We’ve experienced a decent chunk of the game already, and you can read our preview thoughts of The Invincible right here. 
The Invincible hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6.

Yesterday, after Nintendo announced the news that Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario and would instead work for the company as a "Mario Ambassador," a brand new role, Game Informer reached out to ask if Martinet voices Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Nintendo says he does not. 
"While Charles is not involved in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, we're excited to honor his legacy and contributions, including looking ahead to what he'll be doing as Mario Ambassador. Character voice actor will be credited in the game credits, so please wait for the game to be released."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ironwood Studios has delayed Pacific Drive to 2024. 
Initially set to release sometime this year, the team recently announced that it is delaying the game to early 2024, as reported by Eurogamer. As for why, Ironwood Studios says it needs more room to make Pacific Drive the best it can be while also prioritizing the health of everyone on the team. 
As summer comes to a close, we’d like to share that Pacific Drive is moving its release to early 2024.

“As many know, we’ve been hard at work bringing this idea to life for quite some time, and every day adds even more to a game we’re all proud of,” the studio writes on Twitter. “In this final stretch, however, it’s important to us that we stay true to ourselves, and not compromise on the team’s well-being. 
“As our community grows, the support and excitement everyone has shown has been incredible and we can’t wait for everyone to take their own set of wheels out into the Zone. Everyone here at Ironwood truly appreciates your patience and understanding.”
Ironwood Studios says it has a surprise to share this week, as it will be a part of the Future Games Show with a new trailer. 
The team revealed Pacific Drive in 2022, and after checking out a hands-off preview of the survival game last year, we came away excited about its potential. It mixes elements of racing with the survival genre alongside a spooky Pacific Northwest setting that we can’t wait to see more of. You can read our Pacific Drive preview thoughts here. 
Are you going to check out Pacific Drive next year? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. 


“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.


The update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard to know where to start with Six Ages 2 Colon Lights Going Out. The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series' biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) "lore", it's a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.
It's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?

Just in case you’re uncomfortable with imposing a combat sport on sea creatures, the sequel adds humans to the mix, so you can enjoy the zany announcement trailer with a clear conscience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If someone were to write the history of internet video, I think they'd need to mention Killer Bean. Released in 1996, just a year after Toy Story, it was a two-minute, 3D animated short about gun-toting beans, and almost entirely the work of one person. A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.

Now it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There's a first trailer below.

One case is the Arc A770 16GB, which is now available from Newegg for just $300, down from their regular US MSRP of $330.

After that, we have two interviews with folks who are involved with the music of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, but in very different ways. First up, we talk with Katie Chrzanowski, who you may know as the social media manager for the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. However, she's also the producer of the Sonic Symphony, which was livestreamed in 2021 and is heading up the world tour happening this fall. Then, Brian is joined by Tee Lopes, composer of Sonic Mania and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. He also happens to be the composer for the upcoming Sonic Superstars.

The upcoming 2D platformer brings Sonic The Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy back for a new cooperative adventure — however, I'd like to note we only engaged with the single-player experience. After our several-hour hands-on play session, we sat in my hotel room to break down our time playing six of Superstars' 12 zones, including details about each level, boss fights, the signature Emerald Powers, and how the platforming physics behaved.

I'm playing Edders Sheeran in Baldur's Gate 3, a bard with a Dark Urge to lash out and murder largely anything and everything. He doesn't know what causes it, and he doesn't know when the urge might strike. For a first playthrough, it's been a learning experience. Namely, I have learned that friends aren't safe, lest I puncture their guts with my bare fists in the middle of the night.
I thought the urge would only bring downsides (what you'd normally get as a murderer), but I've also learned that it actually has benefits? You get capes in exchange for pulping people! I love capes! Here's to more of them.

I've been in this glorious job for a whole two weeks now, and alas it is time to say goodbye... because I'm off on holiday. Genius-level journostrategist that I am, I managed to book a week away walking in Scotland during Gamescom before landing the gig, and I can't rebook without incurring the everlasting hatred of Caledonian Sleeper. I do have a few under-embargo stories and a review going live next week, but beyond that I'll be up a mountain somewhere until 29th August. Apologies - if you're up that neck of the woods and we happen to sight each other on opposing hillsides, I'll try to bellow something about Starfield.


Before I go, though, I wanted to check in about this whole "news" concept that's doing the rounds. The past two weeks have essentially been an exercise in tentatively pressing buttons and apologising to Katharine when half the website backend catches fire. I've tried to put together a fun mixture of stories - I particularly enjoyed the chat below yesterday's musings about pacifism - but I've mostly been settling in, and dealing with such evergreen journamalism questions as whether companies are singular or plural, and what proportion of any given article should consist of begging Blackbird Interactive to reveal something else about Homeworld 3.

Expectedly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III's campaign picks up where Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II left off. Modern Warfare III will also include what Activision is calling an, "open world Zombies set on the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever." It is also promising a big collection of fan favorite and brand new multiplayer maps. You can check out screens from the campaign in the gallery below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A single GTA 5 mod has rekindled the age-old shouting match about the precise legality and contribution of videogame mods, in the eyes of developers, publishers and players - while also threatening to trigger fresh debate on the use of large language models, aka AI, in game development. The mod in question, "AI Powered GTA V: Story Mode with AI NPCs" sees you investigating a cult of weirdo AI worshippers, with characters who speak AI-generated dialogue. It's now been struck from several sites by GTA 5 publisher Take-Two Interactive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The characters in what we might term the Aperture Cinematic Universe are a memorable bunch (as I have said before). Though GLaDOS rightfully tops the list another, introduced in 2011's sequel spectacular Portal 2, became an instant favourite. Voiced by J.K. Simmons, doing a turn adjacent to his J. J. Jameson from Spider-Man, Cave Johnson is the founder of Aperture Science (which used to primarily make shower curtains before it evolved into being a death trap puzzle company), and he made an instant impression. And though Aperture Desk Job is nominally a tech demo for the Steam Deck, it also expands the Cave Johnson lore in a very satisfying way. Spoilers beyond for Aperture Desk Job, and Portal 2 if you haven't played it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Baldur's Gate 3 modding scene remains dominated by blunt practicalities - more XP! More spellslots! More party members! HIGHLIGHT EVERYTHING! - but there are a few intriguing mods percolating to the top. We've already had one that makes Baldur's Gate 3 a single character RPG, which I am hoping somebody at the RPS Treehouse will do a diary feature about, plus a Painterly Scenery filter created by 1wk, which makes the game look like it's daubed on canvas. But the cluster of mods that caught my eye this morning are a simple change of camera perspective and controls that make the game look strikingly like Bioware's Dragon Age: Origins.

I do a bit of bow, a bit of sword, a bit of plucking the lute and buffing my pals with a nice song. My greatest strength, though, lies outside of combat in the arena known as "conversation". Seriously, I've played for around 30 hours now and haven't lost a single chat skillcheck. At first I loved being a master of chats, but ever since I played some co-op with my pals using a less charismatic dude, I've found Edders Sheeran's unbeatable gob a bit… deflating?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many people that near their eighteenth birthday, the Xbox 360 will soon lose support from its parent company. Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies & TV app will stop working altogether.
However, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you'll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies & TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.
Additionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn't encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform's most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today's announcement post. Here's the most recent batch from November 2021:

        <updated>2023-08-17T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 has been a long time coming, but fans will have to wait a little bit longer as the game has been pushed from October 17 to October 27.
In a press release, developer Remedy Entertainment doesn't cite a technical reason for the delay, only writing that “October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.”
This likely refers to the fact that Alan Wake 2 was originally going to release just three days before the arrival of heavy hitters Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. 
Alan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game's conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. 
Alan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The brutish "X curio is like Y behemoth" logic of mass entertainment nooze requires me to associate Selkie Harbour's The Anglerfish Project with Starfield. They do form a pleasant contrast, in fairness. Both are space games but one doesn't have a fishing mechanic, whereas the other is all fishing mechanic. One is about visiting strange new worlds, establishing outposts and shooting or romancing the heck out of the locals, while the other maroons you on a single asteroid. The Anglerfish Project deserves better than to serve only as a counterpoint for the Bethesda colossus, however - it's a sweet and tidy stargaze 'em up with a dry sense of humour, and you can download it for free on Itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rest of the RPS Treehouse might be fully engrossed in Baldur's Gate 3 at the moment, but the main thing that's been on my mind for the last couple of weeks is stealthy strategy games. Primarily, the exceedingly excellent Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, but also Harebrained Scheme's upcoming turn-based tactics 'em up, The Lamplighters League, a game I've been quietly looking forward to ever since it was announced earlier this year.
Specifically, I've been playing through a handful of missions from the middle of The Lamplighters League's campaign, getting to grips with its full roster of agents and their unique set of skills. It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I'm not gonna lie. I've had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I'd arrived fresh and green, I don't think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is.

With divine expedience you must go forth into a world from which all unworthy creatures impart their knowledge with great excitations, entangling their speech with a verbosity comparable only to how the holy miracle does imbue our city with its fearsome illumination. If you think this a questionable affectation then guard thyselves, oh Penitent Ones, for you really are in store for an awful lot of this.  


Beyond that, Blasphemous 2 is a cracking Metroidvania rooted in satisfying combat and rewarding exploration of the ‘ooh, I didn’t realise this bit was connected to that bit’ vein. Neither element is on the same level of Dark Souls, but then what is?

Steeped in religious themes, the narrative of Blasphemous 2 tells of a land unable to overcome the curse placed on it by a higher power, regardless of how repentant its people are. Playing Blasphemous 2, I sometimes felt the same, as I wondered how I could possibly overcome the challenge before me. But like the denizens of The City of the Blessed Name, I persevered. And though the curses being thrown around my house each time I died were of a different variety than those cast in Blasphemous 2’s story, I loved nearly every minute o…]]></summary>

They're the team behind this May's triumphant System Shock remake, which Jeremy Peel described in his review as "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design". They're also the studio behind last week's surprise-released Quake 2 remaster, and a bunch of other classic 90s remasters including the PC version of DOOM 64 and Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. It's safe to say they know how to pull off a retro (sorry, Kamiya-san) comeback.

He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...]]></summary>

The game's lead designer Emil Pagliarulo and lead quest designer Will Shen have hosted a Discord Q&A about Bethesda's forthcoming space colossus. Self-despising fool that I am, I sat up late at the office taking notes throughout - please accept a modest avalanche of new details.


First off, a note on the subject of Starfield and housing. You can own property in "all the major cities in the game", according to Pagliarulo, with some dwellings being purchaseable and others, quest rewards.


Building on the character creation systems of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, the game features a "Kids Stuff" trait that generates parents based on your choice of custom character, allowing you to inflict your terrible physiognomical experiments on at least two other in-game entities. "No spoilers, but I think fans will really appreciate the actors we got to play those roles," Pagliarulo added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escape Simulator does a great job of virtually scratching that escape room itch I often get, with the added appeal of not having to leave the home comforts of my house or chair. You know what’s also a pretty great puzzle game set in successive rooms you need to escape? Portal. You may have heard of it. And now the two are set to collide in an upcoming bit of free DLC that brings Portal’s test chambers to Escape Simulator.

If you wanted some more proof that Netflix is pretty serious about this whole “getting into video games” thing, the movie streaming platform-turned-games publisher is now looking to unite their two fronts by experimenting with game streaming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.
It seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge's big DLC Dimension Shellshock finally has a release date, as well as another new playable character. 
The expansion arrives on August 31 for $7.99, and a new trailer reveals that fan-favorite character Karai is joining the fun. Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.


Dimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character. 
To learn more about why we think TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is the best Turtles game in decades, read our review here.]]></summary>

It all revolves around the Exhaust Engine, which is a system that dictates player performance based on stamina while rewarding players for attacking on offense. The new Goalie Fatigue system ensures the goalie isn't as effective on the first shot of a power play as he is on follow-up shots.

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a surprisingly human tale. That may sound strange to say about a game with space lizards and brain worms at its center, but behind the hags and psychic tadpoles, Baldur’s Gate 3 is about a group of very broken people trying to find their way in life and maybe save the world. Or turn it into a smoldering heap of agony and misery. It depends on how you feel that day. Whether you choose peace or something less savory, Baldur’s Gate 3’s intricate writing …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom is on the horizon and kicks off with Opening Night Live next week, the E3-style showcase of upcoming games hosted by Geoff Keighley. Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.
Crimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. 
Next Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.

The game's presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.


Crimson Desert doesn't have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We'll likely find out of that's still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.]]></summary>

The event airs at 9 a.m. Pacific/12 p.m. Eastern with an hour-long pre-show prior and a live post-show roundtable discussion. The Final Shape is a significant expansion for fans as it’s billed as the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga. That means everything that has occurred up to this point will culminate with this story. Speaking of which, Bungie released a new video recapping the biggest moments of the Destiny journey.


The showcase will also dive into Season 22, the next reprised raid, among other announcements. For more on Destiny 2, check out our review of its most recent expansion Lightfall, then read about how Keith David has been cast as the new voice of Commander Zavala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!
