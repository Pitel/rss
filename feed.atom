        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The shot meter has undergone a big change in NBA 2K25, but you can choose between different options.


It's been a long debate about whether you should use the meter or not. This year, the familiar meter from the older NBA 2K games has been removed. Instead, you get three options that are distinctly different from the older shapes. By default, you get the upward-moving arrow, but it's not my favorite, and it might not be yours as well. Thankfully, changing the appearance of the shot meter is extremely easy.


NBA 2K25 changing shot meter guide


This year, you get to pick from the following options:



Arrow: A Small arrow moves upwards.


Ring: A Circular ring that diminishes as you attempt a throw.


Circle: A circle that reduces in size and disappears.



No matter which game mode you play, the shot meter can be changed in all of them.

The main game settings can be accessed from Features.


If you play MyTeam and MyCareer, you can change the shot meter from the settings within those respective modes.


Go to Customize HUD.


From there, select "Shot Meter Shots."


Go to the fourth option in this section - Graphic.


From here, you can choose one of the three available options.


You can also change the color of the shot meter.


The size and placement can also be changed based on your preferences.



That's all you need to know about how to change the jump shot meter in NBA 2K25. While it's a good guide for beginners, you will want to turn it off eventually. When the meter is turned off, you'll get a bonus success rate on your green-timed throws, increasing their chances of going inside the basket. It could take you some to get used to, but the switch is definitely worth the effort.


Make sure to make the changes individually across all game modes. Otherwise, they won't reflect during a game.

It‚Äôs still vague on what the expansion will be about, although we can assume it will be Halloween-themed due to its release date. Players can tune in on October 3 for a first look at the new pack, which should reveal many of the new gameplay features, new items, and more. Hopefully, we‚Äôll even get some brand-new deaths for Simmers to try out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragonflight may be over, but one of its best features - customizable mounts - remains. This time, there's just one mount to customize: the Delver's Dirigible. 


What's a dirigible? I think it's just an...old-timey flying machine? I mean, it sure looks like one. Here's how to get it.


Complete Chapter 1 of the War Within Campaign


First, you'll need to complete the entire first chapter of the campaign, which takes you through each of the expansion's zones, introducing you to new allies and races along the way. This is probably a given if you're, you know, playing the expansion. 


Finishing the campaign will lead you back to Dornogal, where you'll pick up chapter 2 after reaching Renown level 4 with each faction. 


Begin Chapter 2, and accept the 'Bountiful Delves' quest from Brann


A few short steps into the campaign's second chapter, you'll be shown around to various stations in Dornogal that pertain to the endgame, such as item upgrade vendors and the Delver's headquarters. The quest Bountiful Delves appears as a purple exclamation mark above Brann during this step, and you'll need to accept (and complete) it for the mount.

This quest requires you to get your hands on a Restored Coffer Key and complete a Bountiful Delve on any difficulty. You actually don't need to use the key in the Delve (which is helpful if you, like me, blew all yours during early access) to complete the quest, you only have to get your hands on one. 


With those steps done, return to Brann and turn in your quest to get another one, which only has one step: receive your new mount. Congratulations!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, fellow spelunkers. If you're enjoying The War Within's new Delves (well, what's currently available, anyway), then you're also probably gunning for those Restored Coffer Keys, which give extra rewards at the end of their Bountiful variations. A word of warning, though: if you want to put them to good use, keep them in your back pocket a while longer.


Bountiful Delve rewards and you


Bountiful Delves reward a guaranteed piece of gear, assuming you've got a Restored Coffer Key to unlock their exclusive chest, of course. This piece of gear's item level and upgrade track will vary depending on the level of Delve you're tackling, with a hard cap at level 8 of item level 603. 


This means you'll get the absolute best possible gear from any given Bountiful Delve at level 8. The problem? Those don't unlock until September 10, so if you're blowing your keys on the current highest level 3, you're doing yourself a disservice. 


Screenshot by Destructoid.


If a level 8 is a bit too salty for your taste, you can get "Champion" level gear (the highest upgrade track available in Delves) from level 7 as well. It'll just be two upgrade tiers lower, at an item level of 597.


Getting Restored Coffer Keys


None of this matters if you don't have keys. I have a whole heaping guide up over here, but the long and short of it is this: You get four guaranteed keys a week from "caches," those chests you get from weekly quests like Theatre Troupe, Spreading the Light, Special Assignment World Quests, etc. Beyond that, you'll need to get fragments from lucky World Quests or Worldsoul Memory Events. I'd say you can expect to get about five keys a week on average. Happy Delving!

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

Image via The MIX Games


The Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland is a thoroughly enjoyable dive into epic nostalgia. Filled with collectables to find, interchangeable characters with special abilities, and levels that look like something directly out of the cartoons you grew up watching.¬†


If you‚Äôre feeling even more nostalgic and want to truly take a trip down memory lane, you can always play in retro style by switching to 8-bit mode. I played the Adventures in Gameland demo in March and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything from the music to the voices brought back wave upon wave of nostalgia, so I highly recommend any '90s kid make the most of this freebie when it arrives.


Also, there‚Äôs multiplayer, which means you can wander around the Rugrats house (and beyond) with a friend, and really bring those memories of cartoons past to life. On top of that, it's coming to Epic Games Store as a freebie only two days after it's set to release! What‚Äôs not to love?

If you‚Äôre not ready to be overwhelmed by nostalgia, you could always go for the second game on offer that week ‚Äî Super Crazy Rhythm Castle. You can play solo, or with up to three friends, making the approach to Rhythm Castle to try and take down King Ferdinand.¬†


The game has over 30 tracks of all genres to play your way through, so there‚Äôs something for all tastes. Imagine Guitar Hero, but with cuter graphics and a story of overcoming adversity and puzzle solving on the side. It‚Äôs all about embracing chaos and, if there‚Äôs ever something I can get on board with, it‚Äôs chaotic fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you make your way across Avarex in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, you'll encounter evidence that a Necromunda is causing havoc on the Forge World. It's preventing The Imperium's other forces from advancing, but you volunteer to take it out in a three-on-one battle. 


The Necromunda is the first truly worthy boss you'll face in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2. While others, such as the Lictor, are a challenge, the Necromunda is a really difficult boss to fight if you don't know what you're doing. It's got a few distinct attack patterns that you must counter, or you're never going to kill it and avenge those fallen Space Marines who attacked it before you.

But I‚Äôm not a coward, and only cowards use copy/paste. I just flex my wrinkly writer brain to churn up some new words.


Have you heard that the Destructoid Changelog Newsletter is a hit at parties? Maybe! I don‚Äôt get invited to parties. It arrives every Friday and comes packed with a recap of all the week‚Äôs reviews, weird articles, and retro stuff that I like. It‚Äôs like me showing up at your doorstep every week, except you can just close the tab instead of calling the police to get me to leave.


That‚Äôs right! Not only will I wish you a good week and draw your attention to some cool things you might have missed, but I‚Äôll also tell you about what I‚Äôm playing that week. I play a lot of weird stuff. It‚Äôs what I do instead of going to parties.


And this is just between you and me, but we‚Äôre also cooking up some sort of monthly surprise for anyone signed up. What is it? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a surprise! Also, I haven‚Äôt settled on anything yet. The next time I do one of these reminders/bumps, I‚Äôll probably have something more solid to tell you, but it will be cool. Cool in a ‚Äúget off my doorstep, Zoey,‚Äù kind of way.


Tell your friends! Tell your therapist! Tell me (what you‚Äôd like to see in the newsletter by leaving a comment below)! Is your Friday ready for this!?

In a Steam announcement, the developer explains how this next update will rework armor penetration, anti-tank weapons, and enemy armor and health values. It'll also make almost all enemies more rewarding to kill instead of feeling like bullet sponges, improve weapons across the board, and bring the focus back the focus on player fantasy ‚Äî feeling powerful despite the fragile bodies we control on the battlefield.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very few things in NBA 2K25 feel as good to perform and can energize your squad more than a well-timed Alley-Oop, a play which, in most cases, can only be performed after perfectly syncing up with a teammate. 


But contrary to what many might think, performing the play is a pretty straightforward affair, even for newcomers. So that you can set the rhythm of any game, here's how to perform both regular and alley-oops to self in NBA 2K25. 


How to perform Alley-Oops in NBA 2K25


You can perform a standard alley-oop in NBA 2K25 by first double-tapping ‚ñ≥/Y while your targeted player makes their way toward the painted area. Doing so prompts you to make the lob pass and causes the input meter to appear on your screen. To finish the play, simply press ‚ñ°/X or tilt the right stick down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been dealt yet another radical, multiplying hand as a release date has been revealed for Balatro Mobile. The iOS and Android version of LocalThunk's widely-acclaimed poker roguelike launches via the App Store, Google Play, and Apple Arcade on September 26, 2024.


Watch as Jimbo ominously introduces the new ports in the release date trailer:¬†




Already a hit on portable platforms like Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck ‚Äî as well as PC and all other major consoles ‚Äî taking Balatro on the go just makes sense. Balatro Mobile has been further tweaked to suit its new platforms, including the addition of remastered controls for touchscreen devices.¬†


Beyond that, the rest of Balatro Mobile appears to be exactly what it should be: Balatro. You've got an abundance of Jokers with special powers you can use with your decks, Campaign Mode and Challenge Mode, and the one-more-run card-dealing madness that remains an utter delight.


Jokers wild

If you're already well-versed in Balatro, or just want some further insight into where the whole thing came from, then boy, do I have a podcast for you. The excellent Eggplant: The Secret Lives of Games podcast had LocalThunk on back in April, and it's absolutely worth a listen, whether you're into the game itself or just love game dev chat.¬†


Balatro was already a brutal time vampire, doing its best to magically whittle away hours before our very eyes. With the game even more accessible to everyone, all I can recommend is that you all go ahead and kiss your free time goodbye.¬†

Pacho has been one of the best performers in the recent Copa America tournament, and the latest FUTTIES item is his best version of this year. Since it's part of an SBC, everyone can obtain the 98-rated card during Season 9 festivities. Let's take a look at how you can play with this card in Ultimate Team.

EA FC 24 Willian Pacho FUTTIES SBC tasks


You won't have too many problems completing the Willian Pacho FUTTIES SBC, as there's just one task. Certain conditions are there that you'll need to meet during squad submission. 


Task 1 - Willian Pacho



Min. 1 Players from Ligue 1 Uber Eats


Min. Team Rating: 89



EA FC 24 Willian Pacho FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here's the solutions for completing the solo task of the Willian Pacho FUTTIES SBC. In case you don't have these exact cards, just use ones with the same overall ratings to avoid wastage of fodder. 


Task 1 - Willian Pacho



Erling Haaland: 91


Kevin De Bruyne: 91


Marc Andre Ter Stegen: 89


Ruben Dias: 89


Rodri: 89


Sandra Panos: 87


Lena Oberdorf: 87


Ewa Pajor: 87


Gregor Kobel: 87


Martin Odegaard: 87


Lautaro Martinez: 87



I like this Pacho FUTTIES card, although he won't replace my starting CBs. I wish it had either Anticipate+ or Intercept+ (it has the silver versions), but the presence of Long Ball+ and Quick Step+. If you boost his Passing and Dribbling (both 90), he might work as an extremely defensive CDM as well. Just because we are in the last two weeks before EA FC 25 comes out, why not give him a try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the new weapons of Destiny 2's Echoes Episode have been the main highlight, some of the returning weapons are also intriguing. The Perfect Paradox, for example, has quickly returned to its place as a mainstay in most arsenals and a capable shotgun for both PvE and PvP content.


One such returning weapon takes on a rather new form of grenade launcher, but one that is surprisingly great for ad clear. Here's the god roll for the Martyr's Retribution grenade launcher in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Martyr's Retribution god roll in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid.


Martyr's Retribution sports the Wave Frame archetype, meaning it has one round in its clip and sends an energy wave out upon impact. This wave does quite a bit of damage but does cause the impact itself to be considerably weaker. Compared to some grenade launchers, this makes it far less suited for boss damage and more so for ad clear. The following perks and attachments help play into that role:



Launcher Barrel: Quick Launch


Magazine: High-Velocity Rounds


Perk 1: Heal Clip


Perk 2: Incandescent



Quick Launch causes any shots from the Martyr's Retribution to come out fast while increasing handling speed. Easier use of the weapon is nothing to scoff at. High-Velocity Rounds further increases that projectile speed while also bringing in reload speed. Given we aren't running Auto-Loading Holster, that's quite helpful.


Heal Clip is great for supporting yourself and your allies, especially since you'll be focusing on many lower-health enemies, reloading frequently, and getting plenty of kills to trigger it. Incandescent aids that goal, causing scorch to nearby targets and improving the area of effect damage.

"Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In NBA 2K25's MyTeam mode, an evolution player is one one of the best ways to improve your team.


Unlike standard cards, evolution items can improve over time. While there's a limit on how much they can grow, the improvements will dramatically change the look and feel of your cards. In fact, you can get up to five starter evolution players when beginning your MyTeam journey in Season 1. Let's take a look at how you can improve all five cards and take them all the way up from Emerald to Ruby.


NBA 2K25 MyTeam evolution guide


Recognizing an evolution card is pretty easy. They will usually have different designs as their background. Moreover, when you go to edit player and select these cards, there will be an added option to evolve them.



To evolve an evolution card, you'll need to satisfy certain conditions, which you can check by going through the card details.


To evolve the starter Emerald cards, just play a game with them (they don't need to be starters).


Once you have completed the condition, go to edit player.


Select the card.


Go to evolutions and hold the X/A button till the meter fills up.

That's all you need to complete an evolution. Once the upgrade is complete, your superstar's card stats and design will change. If you have joined the party in early access, you can get a starting lineup of five 88-rated Ruby items for free of cost. Yes, it will take some time to evolve all of them, and no, there's no way to grow them together.


Completing the starter evolution agenda will also reward you with a Series 1 Deluxe pack. At the start of our journeys, every bit helps, and I was lucky enough to pull a 90-OVR Amethyst Joel Embiid from my free pack.

It lets you capture enemies' special properties and abilities and use whatever loadout they choose. A great way to add variety and customization to the combat, making¬†Dawn of Sorrow¬†an all-time favorite of mine.


However, there are secret combinations of souls that can unlock special effects. These combinations help give you more to consider when setting up your loadout. It can be a lot of silly fun to mess around with different souls to see what synergizes well. We've created this guide to help identify all the combos and their unique extra effects so you don't have to do the legwork.

We are back with the latest look at Japan's video game sales chart (via Famitsu) and it has been quite the week for new releases, with eight titles in the top ten making their debut.
The big newbie for Nintendo fans is the arrival of Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, which is performing far better than it is in the UK and has landed fifth place with 25,028 copies sold. It's Gundam Breaker 4 on Switch, however, that takes the top spot this week with 52,825 sales (the PS5 and PS4 versions land in third and sixth respectively).

Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here comes the Sun.
Despite the energetic title of this collection, the legendary Japanese development house Sunsoft never really went away. It's been steadily cranking out original titles, ports, and remasters on arcade and console since 1978, although it will likely never recapture the glory days of the 8- and 16-bit era. So prolific was its output that anyone who owned an NES or a SNES will have likely had multiple Sunsoft games in their collection. This Sunsoft is Back! bundle presents three titles released for the first time outside of Japan, beautifully emulated, and boasting a full English translation.
First up is the fantastically titled Firework Thrower Kantaro's 53 Stations of the Tokaido. Playing as the titular explosive merchant, you must reach your fianc√©e in Edo, beset on all sides by a rival merchant's mercenary band. Kantaro‚Äôs adventure is a fun scrolling platformer of sorts, which has you dealing with tricky projectile-throwing arcs against enemies that bounce all over the place. Nailing a good shot against an approaching ninja is satisfying, but overall this one is a bit simplistic.

It's no secret that we love Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Addison here at Nintendo Life (at least, I do), so when we heard that Affordable Space Adventures dev Nifflas was solving the NPC's sign-standing puzzles in creative ways, we had to take a look. Reader, we were not disappointed (thanks for the tip, d-slice).
Now, when most of us solve an Addison puzzle in TOTK, it's a simple case of slapping a nearby boulder underneath the President Hudson sign or, at most, building a rudimentary frame for it. Not for Nifflas, it seems.

Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

As of today (5th September), McDonald's customers in Australia can nab themselves a sweet Mario Kart toy with every Happy Meal thanks to the latest crossover with Nintendo (thanks, Vooks).
Unlike the cardboard collaborations we've seen in the past (like last year's Mario Movie European collection), this Australian range consists of ten plastic karts with some familiar faces behind the wheel. Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Toad, Toadette, Bowser, Peach and Yoshi are joined by a swanky Gold Mario and Rose Gold Peach this time ‚Äî though all of them are Kart-only, so don't expect any bikes like we saw in North America a little while back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They‚Äôre map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve‚Äôs third-person elephant in the lane.

Following the latest round of industry whispers about this anticipated device, "industry insider" Nate the Hate is now claiming this new device "has backwards compatibility support". This latest update (via VGC) follows similar backwards compatibility claims from peripheral maker Mobapad earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

One of the coolest features of the game was highlighted in PlayStation Blog's impressions ‚Äî a customisable soundtrack that harks back to Sakaguchi and composer Nobuo Uematsu's past. Yep, you'll be able to select Final Fantasy songs and listen to them while you're in combat. Very, very cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

Listen. If you're fed up with roguelikes, deckbuilders and the like, we feel you. In the indie sphere in particular, there are an awful lot of games in these genres right now, enough to have us auto-glaze over anytime we see the words mentioned, and even though there are plenty of good 'uns, it does get a little tired. So it's great when examples, like Roboatino's Shogun Showdown, pop up every now and again to remind us that there's still gold in them there hills. Thanks.
So, why is Shogun Showdown so special, you ask? Well, it's one of those rarefied experiences that make you feel a special sort of stupid. It's what all the very best games do. Alongside your Darkest Dungeons' and your Into the Breaches, this is right up there with the cream of recent crops.

Oh boy, here we go... As we get closer and closer to the end of the year, speculation around when Nintendo will reveal the Switch successor is beginning to reach its peak.
Now, thanks to a few social media posts circulating from key industry figures, rumours of a potential 'Switch 2' reveal (or at least something Switch 2-related) happening this month are beginning to swiftly gather pace. The first comes from Gameindustry.biz's Chris Dring, who posted a tweet that simply states "With industry whispers around ‚Äòsomething‚Äô Switch 2-related happening this month, I thought I‚Äôd remind everyone of the official list of the greatest games consoles of all time" (it's the Switch, of course, but that's not the important thing here.

Just a few weeks after the 'Worlds Part I' expansion, Hello Games is back with another No Man's Sky update. This one adds a feature that we suspect will be welcomed with open arms from all players: fishing!
In a brief update from Sean Murray, the team at Hello Games was inspired by a piece of artwork submitted to Reddit following the last update, in which a sole fisherman is sitting atop his ship, fishing pole in hand, waiting for something to finally snag the bait.

It‚Äôs fairly safe to say that everyone was pretty jazzed when Nintendo announced The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. We haven‚Äôt had a new top-down Zelda game since 2013‚Äôs A Link Between Worlds, assuming of course you don‚Äôt count Tri Force Heroes, and if that was your mindset, we wouldn't entirely blame you.
But the real test to see if all this non-swordy-style gameplay could actually work is actually playing it. Thankfully, Nintendo graciously invited us to do just that, so we‚Äôre the experts on the matter now. Accept no substitutes.

Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

Alongside a global release time map (or two maps, technically, since they‚Äôre pulling that pay-more-to-play-early nonsense), there‚Äôs a big Q&A covering all your burning questions about burning 'nids. Among these is a confirmation that, no, the action game won‚Äôt be implementing DRM software such as Denuvo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been negligent in our duty as watchkeepers of extreme sports games. Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in a funny and thematically appropriate way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm released last Tuesday, and hasn‚Äôt gone down too well with fans of the co-op roguelite. How not well, you ask? To shreds, I say - it‚Äôs currently sitting at 79% ‚Äòmostly negative‚Äô rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are‚Ä¶uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it‚Äôs taken many of the base game‚Äôs core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they‚Äôre targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (‚Äúdefinitely not intentional‚Äù), and ‚Äúan issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers‚Äù.

Most chilling of all, Aldi have discontinued their Village Bakery Seeded Medium Sliced Loaf (400g), replacing it with deeply inferior Village Bakery Lightly Seeded Loaf (800g). Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence. Until then, here are this week‚Äôs PC game releases of note.

With many resurrections and Dr. Who-like regenerations over recent years, some seem optimistic. Government records suggests that business bridges are being built from Hollywood to Vietnam, and back again. It seems unlikely that the resurrection of pirate sites would help in any way.

Fallout Tactics is free, too, but I don't know whether Todd's cruel enough to want people to experience that one as it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is with quiet anticipation (and some nervousness) that I await to be stepped upon by a freaky mech in The Forever Winter. If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say ‚Äúwon‚Äù. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I‚Äôd gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he‚Äôd heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there‚Äôs probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don‚Äôt have time for that. Instead, I‚Äôd like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It‚Äôs a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It‚Äôll set you back $25, ¬£20 or ‚Ç¨25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

In parallel, the Vietnamese Government is organizing a promo tour in Hollywood.

The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words ‚Äúbloody‚Äù and ‚Äúarse‚Äù in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid‚Äôs crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
‚ÄúOil just use my trusty knoife‚Äù mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you‚Äôre probably expecting. Fine with me - that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm here for. Mimimi‚Äôs closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don‚Äôt expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it‚Äôs at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

It‚Äôs one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don‚Äôt worry, the ‚Äúmummies‚Äù of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed ‚Äúmothers‚Äù you‚Äôve been hearing about down the grocers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes you forget to build a graveyard. It happens. When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do like a combat system that resembles an overflowing dressmaker's draw, full of bouncing rubber thimbles and coils of bunting. While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle √âpoque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update:  This evening, we received the following "communication from the Spiders studio":

Paris, 28th August 2024 ‚Äì The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vid√©o) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter‚Äôs September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don‚Äôt want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the ‚Äúpacks‚Äù that his space game‚Äôs baubles come in. ‚ÄúOur fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,‚Äù he said, comparing Space Marine 2‚Äôs optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday‚Äôs roadmap does look to make good on Saber‚Äôs promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here‚Äôs it:

In the absence of an official announcement, earlier today we took an early sift through the wreckage.

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they‚Äôre kind of incredible as film sets. That‚Äôs your job here. This is where the game is.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated".

In Ireland, anti-piracy group FACT in partnership with Crimestoppers would like you to 'report' this activity. These 'snitch' initiatives are not widely embraced by the public but with a six-week social media push, the campaign aims to identity new enforcement targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom".

I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.
