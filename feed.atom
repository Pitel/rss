        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Treyarch has players putting on their detective hats to piece together the puzzle after releasing a creepy teaser video for the upcoming Call of Duty title. 


Treyarch created a new website domain called the truth lies. When you go on to the website, a video on a CRT shows a group of people climbing Mount Rushmore and putting blindfolds over the former presidents' faces with "the truth lies" written on the first three. The fourth blindfold has what will presumably be the logo for the next title. Since the TV on the website only goes up to Channel 6, this strongly hints at the title being Call of Duty Black Ops 6.




As Call of Duty fans play around more with the TV on the website and pick through the video with a fine-tooth comb, more teasers will undoubtedly be discovered. There will reportedly be a full reveal for the next Call of Duty at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9 at 10 AM PT. Knowing Treyarch, more teasers are likely on the way.


This particular video coincidentally arrives one day after Ubisoft launched its 6v6 arena shooter, XDefiant.  Ubisoft executive producer and former Call of Duty dev Mark Rubin has previously shot down any comparisons or competition between the two titles. Still, it's hard to overlook the timing of the video, as Call of Duty briefly steals the spotlight back for a moment.  


As for when players can get their hands on the upcoming title, rumors suggest that Black Ops 6 will launch in late October. The new Call of Duty is expected to be available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox, and there's a lot of speculation around whether it may also come to Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4's fourth season introduced just a few crumbs of what could be called "seasonal mechanics," but what's there is still pretty fun. From the Profane Mindcage, which boosts enemy levels in Helltides by 10 to the Momentum Elixir that let's you zoom across the battlefield after scoring kills, there's no shortage of new twists to blasting enemies. But one seems to be standing out from the rest. 


The Elixir of Holy Bolts asks, "what if Artillery Shrine, but all the time?" It causes damaging bolts to explode out of any enemy killed, (usually) dealing enough damage to kill another enemy, which also fires out bolts, killing another enemy and.. you get the idea. It's essentially a cascade of death in any high-density areas. 


This strategy excels most of all in The Pit, Diablo 4's new endgame activity. Enemies are packed so tightly together that starting a Holy Bolt chain-reaction is sometimes enough to clear entire sections of the map at once. It's so powerful it could be a "seasonal mechanic" in its own right, if only it didn't last 15 minutes. 


The good news is that once your time's up you can easily get more Elixirs by trading 350 Obols to the Alchemist under the "Seasonal Elixir" tab for another. It's a hefty price, to be sure, but the power gains and time saved clearing Pit runs is worth it in my opinion. Of course, you can also score these as drops from Helltide Elites and bosses. Whatever you do, keep at least one in your back pocket for those broom closets of baddies.

The second week requires we delve back into the confines of the ruined Tower for a second set of switches in Outbreak Refined II.


Where to find the second pair of switches in Destiny 2 Zero Hour


After completing Outbreak Refined I and logging in the subsequent week, you'll receive a missive to visit Ada-1 in the Tower's Annex. The armorer has an idea of how to upgrade Outbreak Perfected further.


The first step is to defeat Fallen in the Exodus Garden 2A Lost Sector in the Cosmodrome for Inert SIVA Clusters. To get there, load into the Cosmodrome and turn around from Shaw Han. Head to where New Lights are born and atop the broken roadway in the back. There's no need to have Outbreak Perfected equipped for this step, so get blasting.


The second step is to pull a second pair of switches in the Legend version of the Zero Hour Exotic Mission. After clambering through the vents just past Hatch 03, you'll be in the canyon hallway. In opposing divots in the wall will be Fallen. Deal with them first and look for the first switch on the right side of the first divots.

The second switch is in the room past the next vent. Jump over the red piping to find it tucked in the corner.

The third step is to complete Zero Hour on Legend. Fortunately, since this second set of switches is on the way, you shouldn't have too much trouble in the time department. Once it's completed, head back to Ada-1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XDefiant's launch has been rocky, to say the least, and while players are now getting into matches, there are issues with controllers not working that leave you unable to play. Here's what you can do to fix them. 


When XDefiant was released worldwide on May 21, FPS fans rushed to get into the game and try out the supposed "CoD killer," only to be unable to find matches and get kicked off the servers. Once they finally got into matches, they discovered that their controllers wouldn't work, leaving them unable to move around or aim their guns. 


Now, in my expert opinion, not being able to move or aim in an FPS game is not a good recipe for success, so if you're struggling with this problem, here's what you can do to fix it.

XDefiant controller not working fixes


Restart the game


It may sound like the easiest answer, but having studied and worked in IT, the simple answers are often the right ones. If the game isn't working and your controller isn't doing anything, simply restart the game. 


Unplug your controller


Sometimes I find that my controller doesn't work if I don't unplug it when the game is closed, plug it back in, and then open the game again. This is a constant issue on Call of Duty for me, but could help with XDefiant too. 


Restart your PC


If restarting your game hasn't worked, I would suggest restarting your PC. "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" isn't just a meme from the IT Crowd, it's a way of life for those of us cursed to fix people's computers. 


Use DS4Windows


If you're using a PlayStation DualSense controller, Windows can sometimes struggle to pick it up and get it to work with games. That's where DS4Windows comes in, an app that essentially tricks your computer into treating your PS controller like an Xbox one.

Blizzard has taken to calling the very rarest “Uber Unique” items. Take the Harlequin Crest, for example. It’s an item that has been found in Diablo 1 and 2, and makes a return for 4. But only for extremely lucky players.

So, to immediately reiterate what I just said, the drop rate on the Harlequin Crest is extremely low. Somewhere in the realm of 1-2%. Even with the information I’m about to give you, there’s no guarantee you’ll ever see one. The Uber Unique items are considered to be the pinnacle of loot.

You’ll start to earn Poetics after reaching level 50 in your first Job, and they’re earned by doing basically anything - The Hunt, Deep Dungeons, Raids, Tribal quests, and even large-scale content such as Bozja or Eureka all reward Poetics, as long as they’re from a previous expansion. The only common content I can think of that doesn’t reward Poetics is FATEs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. 
In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.
That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. 


In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. 
Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are tired of being killed by the MP7 in XDefiant, it might be time to start using the devastating SMG yourself. Here is the best set of attachments, and Faction to use in tandem with the popular weapon. 


XDefiant supports several different play styles, depending on how you enjoy approaching a match. For players who enjoy being aggressive, shotguns and SMGs are the two best weapon classes for running and gunning. XDefiant's meta will still take some time to settle in fully, but the MP7 is the preferred weapon for any gunfight 10 meters away or closer. The MP7 has it's fair share of shortcomings, but that tradeoff is worth it for one of the best weapons in the title.

Riven is one of the final encounters in the Last Wish Raid and one of the pivotal characters in Season 23, Season of the Wish. While Last Wish is still heralded among the best Raids Destiny 2 offers, Guardians seem allergic to learning the fight, as various "cheese" methods have persisted over the actual mechanics. While it's easy enough to have two Stasis Titans smash Riven to smithereens in a few seconds, it's much more rewarding to have mastery over the encounte…]]></summary>

Despite the bleakness that appears to accompany the gaming world at the moment, many have been looking forward to this release, so it's worth going over the basics of what systems you can play it on.


Now, being as it's published by Xbox Game Studios, it stands to reason that Hellblade 2 is exclusive to the Xbox Series X|S. And, indeed, it is. It's also available on Steam, where it's currently looking pretty good, with a current review score of "Very Positive." But it's early days yet.




However, there's likely to be a few PlayStation users out there who will be wondering whether the game will come to the PS5. Currently, there don't appear to be any plans to release it on Sony's syste…]]></summary>

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.

It feels like Donkey Kong is everywhere at the moment. With the lovable ape’s significant appearance in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the upcoming DK-themed expansion at Japan’s Super Nintendo World, and the safe, but enjoyable Mario vs. Donkey Kong Switch remake, you could say we’re in the midst of a Kong-aissance reawa-Kong-ing revitalisat-Kong... a return for DK. But something’s missing, right?
Yes, despite Nintendo’s renewed focus on Mario’s former nemesis, we’ve still yet to see the very thing that fans have been clamouring for since the 2014 release of Tropical Freeze: a brand-new Donkey Kong game. Of course, recent details surrounding the cancelled ‘Freedom’ project at Vicarious Visions have exacerbated an already-agonising wait, but it nevertheless feels like something might well be cooking within Nintendo’s iron-clad fortress.

Going forward, that position will be filled by one Shams Jorjani, an industry veteran who previously worked at fellow Swedish company Paradox Interactive as its chief business development officer.


Does this mean Pilestedt is leaving Arrowhead altogether? No, as he explains in this interview with GamesIndustry.biz, he will remain as the studio's chief creative officer and chairman. The change in leadership is so Pilestedt can dedicate himself to game creation once again; something he hasn't been able to do as much as CEO.

You’ll need 46 Perpetual Calibers to Ascend Wanderer to level 90. This means defeating the Aeonblight Drake about 18 times, which equates to spending around 720 Resin at World Level 8.


Rukkhashava Mushrooms


Despite being from Inazuma, Wanderer uses Rukkhashava Mushrooms from Sumeru. You can find these scattered around Sumeru, primarily in Mawtiyima Forest and Apam Woods. Wanderer’s ability to fly is pretty handy for gathering mushrooms in the branches,…]]></summary>

Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

The AK-47 is a mid-range powerhouse that offers high damage with a low rate of fire. It's perfect for lasering targets, though falls off at longer ranges with some rough recoil and especially tough handling in full auto. As such, we want attachments that help reinforce its position at mid-range, while also giving it some help for those longer ranges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no better feeling than topping the leaderboard in the game of your choice, but if you want to send kudos to one of your teammates, then you need to learn how to send High-Fives in XDefiant. 


Not only will it make you look like a nice and friendly gamer, but it can also help you complete the High-Fivist Trophy, which is necessary if you want to get 100% completion in XDefiant. Unfortunately, Ubisoft doesn't really explain the High-Five system very well, which is why I've put together this guide to help you out. 


Sending High-Fives in XDefiant: Explained


While the achievement calls them High-Fives, they don't appear as that in-game. Instead, they are green thumbs-up icons that appear at the end of matches to show the appreciation of your teammates. 


You can view what they look like below, and please ignore the fact that nobody sent me any. Also don't look at the big "LOSERS" sign behind us. It was my first game on. 


As you can see, nobody sent me a High-Five. Screenshot via Destructoid


If someone on your team has done well or had a moment that saved the game for you, then here's how you send a High-Five. 


To send High-Fives in XDefiant, simply hover over the player you want to congratulate and press A, X, or Enter if you're using a keyboard.  A green thumbs-up will then appear above their card. 


Remember, you can only do this once per match, so don't give it to the lowest-performing player if you don't really mean it. There's not restriction on how many you get though, so if you absolutely dominate, you may end up with five thumbs-ups above your name. Impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turn the Paige.
Though plenty of Paper Mario fans are eagerly awaiting the return of one of the greatest games in the series at the time of writing, there’s another new game set in a papery world that we’d suggest you pay attention to. Newfangled Games’ Paper Trail is the debut release of the boutique London-based studio, and its smart mixture of creative puzzle design with gorgeous storybook visuals makes for a compelling puzzle experience. Paper Trail is a pretty simple game at heart, but it’s so fresh in its ideas and execution that it’ll stick around in your mind long after you’ve finished it.
Paper Trail places you in the role of Paige, an intelligent girl living with her family in a quiet seaside village who has aspirations of going to school to become an astrophysicist. Her parents oppose her choice to go to college, however, leading to Paige running away from her family and home towards her goals. Along the way, she uses her ability to change reality to help strangers she encounters, who in turn provide her with companionship as she gets farther away from home. It’s a pretty simple premise, but it’s helped greatly by the voiced ‘journal entries’ as you travel between worlds, which also help flesh out Paige’s tragic backstory and motivations for choosing her vocation. It’s not exactly a ‘deep’ narrative, but it draws you in and lulls you into a sense of ease with its soft magical realism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'd think after Nintendo shut down the Nintendo Network servers for the 3DS and Wii U in April, even the most die-hard of players would move on. Yet here we are, over a month later, and there's reportedly three people who are somehow still connected to the Nintendo Network, and it only recently used to be four.


This is according to Twitter user Gaffs, who runs a Nintendo Network After Hours Discord and has been documenting the aftermath of the servers being shutdown. One of the players, Lcd101, we already reported on last month as they've been sharing daily updates on what Splatoon 1 looks like now that its online features don't work. The other two are Fishguy6564 in Mario Kart 7 and SlitherySheep in Super Mario Maker.

You nod with solemn respect and you say, "Alice". An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

Fans have no doubt been eagerly awaiting for a full breakdown on what Bungie has in store for it and the answer is... a lot. In fact, Bungie has decided to put together three separate previews for The Final Shape because there's simply too many changes to cover all at once.


The Destiny 2 Team Twitter account recently explained how it's preparing a preview article on abilities and armour tuning for The Final Shape. However, it wound up coming at around a whopping 9,000 words, making it one of the largest articles Bungie has ever written for Destiny 2. Since that's clearly too much to drop on players, Bungie is splitting it up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not just Steam that Kingdom Hearts is coming to, as according to prominent leaker MbKKssTBhz5, a special crossover is also set to arrive in Fortnite. 


When discussing the news that the Kingdom Hearts series will launch on Steam on June 13, MbKKssTBhz5 revealed that they believe a new platform isn't the only place we'll see Kingdom Hearts this year, suggesting that not only could it come to Nintendo hardware, but to other games too, specifically mentioning that Fortnite was "part of this initiative."


Unfortunately, they don't have any more information about what it could include or when it could happen, but my mind immediately goes to a Sora character skin, and a Keyblade harvesting tool. 




Of course, the idea of Kingdom Hearts arriving in Fortnite makes a ton of sense. Kingdom Hearts is all about Disney characters, and Disney now owns a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games. What better way to maximize your revenue than to create a crossover with a property you already control, rather than working with an outside identity on licensing agreements or revenue shares?


As for when this crossover could happen, it would make a lot of sense to do it around the release of Kingdom Hearts on Steam, but that is just three weeks away, and we would usually see more concrete rumors about a potential crossover by now if that were to be the case. 


The other suggestion is that it could be around the release of Kingdom Hearts IV, but with it not scheduled to launch until 2025, that seems like a long time to wait. We may get new trailers this year though, which may be a better time to drop some themed cosmetics in Fortnite. 


Remember though, this is a leak and is definitely not confirmed, so make sure to take it with a hefty pinch of salt. In the meantime, we still have a Fallout crossover event to enjoy in Fortnite, so there are plenty of opportunities to spend your V-Bucks in the future.

For those that did manage to get into a game, they discovered that XDefiant's hit detection wasn't working as expected, heading to Reddit to voice their frustrations.

After a rather lengthy wait, we now have our first proper trailer for the upcoming show, officially titled Dead Cells: Immortalis, and it looks, well, kinda cool! It's leaning into humour a lot more than we were expecting. Granted, we're not really sure what we were expecting, but given the game's ties to Castevania, we perhaps had the latter's Netflix adaptation in mind when picturing a potential Dead Cells show.

The well-balanced AR shreds through enemies and is easy enough for any beginner to equip without much of a learning curve. Here is the best set of attachments to use on the ACR 6.8. 


It will take a few days for the XDefiant meta to settle in, but all signs point toward the ACR 6.8 being at the top of popularity lists. Ubisoft hosted the All-Star Series, a tournament featuring first-person shooter legends, ahead of XDefiant's launch. Most AR players in the tournament used an ACR 6.8, alluding to it being the best option in the class. 


After getting hands-on experience, it's easy to see why so many players have fallen head over heels for the ACR 6.8.

Now, the studio is diving into the nitty gritty, explaining how weapons and their Perks are due to change in The Final Shape.


Typically, Bungie rebalances weapons and Perks twice an expansion, with one overhaul coming just before launch and another happening around the mid-way point.

How FFXIV housing demolition works for private estates


There are two different types of houses you can buy and build in FFXIV: private estates and Free Company houses.

The Goldilocks Difficulty


Dynamic Difficulty adjusts the difficulty of combat (without touching puzzles) based on the performance of the player. Essentially, if you're obliterating foes with ease and not getting hit all that much, the difficulty will increase. Conversely, if you're being treated like a punching bag, the difficulty will scale down until that isn't the case.

Nintendo is, historically, extremely cautious when it comes to acquiring outside developers, preferring strategic partnerships rather than introducing financial risk by having more teams come under the first-party umbrella. Nintendo's coffers have been spilling over throughout the Switch's cycle and it could have easily gone on an Embracer-style spending spree during the COVID boom years, but that's not its style.

Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion. It requires ownership of the original game and will cost $39.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has announced that several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month. Three compilations, and a compilation of those compilations, will bring the entire “Dark Seeker Saga” to Valve’s storefront.
On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC
Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece (bundle that includes all the above compilations)
If you’re jumping into the series for the first time or returning from a long absence and have no idea how to decipher the bizarre names of these titles, here’s what each game includes:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories
Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts: Re:Coded (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD
Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A Fragmentary Passage-
Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover (movie)
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind
Kingdom Hearts III
Re Mind DLC
This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the Epic Game Store since 2021. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.
The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would “aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper, un-jammed.
Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the standard for Mario RPGs for 20 years. It, alongside its N64 predecessor, captured what fans wanted from their turn-based, plumber-starring adventures – silly humour, epic adventures, fantastic combat, and charm. Purists often view the GameCube original as the end of the 'true' Paper Mario style – a little bit unfair, perhaps, when Super Paper Mario and The Origami King are both great, if undeniably different from that original formula.
It should be no surprise that the Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door was celebrated upon its announcement. Even if you like other Paper Mario titles, it’s hard to argue that Thousand-Year Door wasn't a high point for the plumber, not just in the RPG space but in Mario’s wider canon. Two decades later, that still holds true, and now the best Mario RPG is finally more accessible.

Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.]]></summary>

The Mario brand of RPG represents some of my favorite adventures in the genre. The comedic tone, inviting art, and active battle systems have always been highlights for me, but Thousand-Year Door was a personal blind spot. I played prior and subsequent Mario RPGs, but I skipped it when the original was released in 2004, and notably was not yet employed at Game Informer at the time. With Nintendo remastering the acclaimed RPG for Switch, I welcomed the excuse to finally play it. I am impressed by how improved the…]]></summary>

NBA fans have debated, are debating, and will continue to debate LeBron James' legacy until the end of time. But after 22 years in the league, questions of his GOAT status, his Rings won or his points scored are getting tired. It's time that we move on to the real meat of the discussion.
By "real meat," we are of course referring to hypothetical match-ups between the Lakers power forward and legendary Pokémon (what else could we be talking about? Basketball? Pfft), specifically how the NBA star would fare against Mewtwo in a one-on-one game to 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remake of the 1994 first-person immersive sim shooter was completely remade by developer Night Studios recently and it is finally making its way to consoles. It's the game that laid the groundwork for experiences like Bioshock, 2017's Prey, and many more in the genre, and the remake is both faithful and impressively contemporary. Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and me for a look at the game's opening moments on Xbox Series X and a discussion about the state of the genre that System Shock arguably invented.

I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Player First Games and publisher Warner Bros. Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees and The Matrix's Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. 
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. 
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: 


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios, the team behind last year's Baldur's Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher's seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. 
"With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene," the company's announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. 


As for what those two RPGs are, don't expect a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian's CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur's Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur's Gate series in general. 
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. 
"Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw," the blog post reads. "Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that's why we've put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture." 
For more, read Game Informer's Baldur's Gate 3 review, and then find out why it's on Game Informer's list of the top 10 RPGs to play right now.

My brand new fancy shmancy ottoman bed is arriving in my new flat, after two weeks of curling up on the sofa with a weighted blanket. I'll also be topping it with my brand new ultra-thick memory foam mattress topper, raising me off the floor another crucial few inches. Think of the view I'll get from up there! To imagine there'll be any time for games! Pah!
I kid. Plenty of time for games for us all, even while reclining on gloriously beds with ungodly amounts of storage space. We love playing games here at Rock Paper Shotgun. Even Alice, who has routinely told me that actually there are no good games. Here's what we'll be clicking on this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. 
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, "Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances." The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. 
FNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its excellent Amazon Prime series and the next-gen update for Fallout 4. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon
pic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST
May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.
For more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around a week after Microsoft shuttered a number of beloved studios with a track record of making excellent single-player, story-driven games, their newly-owned arm of Activision has revealed a brand new studio. Working on a new series of story-driven, triple-A games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love building games, but it's not that often that put one down and feel particularly tempted to get straight back into it again. Of Life And Land is one of those, but thankfully not so much so that it threatens to consume my every waking moment.
It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it's lovely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25’s cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game’s first full trailer provides the look at it in action. 
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit. 


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery. 

EA Sports College Football 25 launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can learn more about its various editions, pricing, and features here.]]></summary>

No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“In one of Nero’s many manifests,” reads a books in surreal puzzle-box Lorelei And The Laser Eyes, referring to its eccentric (read: tastefully deranged) antag-artist, “there is a satirical proposal claiming that only dictators should be allowed to direct films.” Developers Simogo - of well-deserved Sayonara Wild Hearts and Device 6 acclaim - seem to agree that’s a position worth satirising. Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it's still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

        <updated>2024-05-17T14:10:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. 
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. 


However, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. 
"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte," the story reads. 
Of course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. 
As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.

May 16, 2024
While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. 
The last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. 
On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. 
BioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. 
SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule.

I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man's stats were specced high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.
Publisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.
Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. 
Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. 
As we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.
You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoenix Labs, the developer behind last year's Fae Farm and Dauntless, has laid off staff and canceled in-development games as part of a restructuring at the studio. Polygon's Nicole Carpenter is reporting on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 100 people at Phoenix Labs were laid off. 
Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following statement: 


Phoenix Labs released its latest game, Fae Farm, back in September, and Dauntless before that in 2019. 
These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year. 
Square Enix announced earlier this week it will begin layoffs as part of "structural reforms," starting this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports College Football finally has a release date, cover stars, and two different editions. The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.
Gracing the cover of the game’s Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.

The cover reveal comes a day before the game's full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it's being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.
Both editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. 
The $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.
Lastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new "narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise." The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. 
This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. 


"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas," a blog post reads. "The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. 
"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience." 
Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024's surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.
Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  


Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. 
Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You will need an internet connection to install Assassin's Creed Shadows, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. 
Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. 


"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," the statement reads. "Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. 

"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way." 

As you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. 
Assassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.
For more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.

In the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Yosuke Saito, the series producer for Nier, teased that he might be working on something new with Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe, the director and composer for the Nier series, respectively.
Via Gematsu and PCGamer, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.

        <updated>2024-05-15T17:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.
Ubisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,
“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”


The Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. 
Despite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. 
Heartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing its reveal earlier this week, Ubisoft has officially unveiled Assassin's Creed Shadows with its first cinematic trailer, revealing dual protagonists in the process. As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.
This dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate – but it's exciting nonetheless. According to the game's PlayStation preorder page, players can, "Switch seamlessly between two unlikely allies as you discover their common destiny," conf…]]></summary>

Come on, Terry. No you haven’t. You spend weekends eating custard creams and watching Bake Off. You haven’t thought about brutalism since undergrad, be honest. Anyway, my version of that is Starship Troopers. As in, I’ve been waiting for a videogamey excuse to bang on about it in public for ages. Helldivers 2 is obviously as good an excuse as any, but really, I needn’t have waited so long. Official offerings like strategy game Starship Troopers: Terran Command and FPS Robocop: Rogue City aside, I reckon you can find Paul Verhoeven’s fingerprints all over games.

Last month, I had a chance to play Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble, the first all-new entry in the Super Monkey Ball (SMB) franchise in more than a decade. While I went into the demo skeptical that the series, which experienced its best years in the early-to-mid 2000s, could feel like a modern experience in 2024, I emerged from the demo impressed by the gameplay improvements, single-player level design, and the game's approach to multiplayer (you can read my full preview here).

"I really like cats, I just hate the internet UWU nonsense about cats," I said. "God it's awful, I can't stand it, Jesus Christ it's just an empty and terrible way to talk about cats, cats don't deserve to be the internet animal-" at which point Graham managed to interrupt and said I was exactly the person who should write about Little Kitty, Big City.
I promise, I approached Little Kitty, Big City with an open heart, because I do really like cats. But given my aversion to their babification by the internet, it may be surprising that my chief complaint about Little Kitty, Big City is that the hats in it are largely not cute enough. This is a bold claim, because there are more than 40 to collect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO/Max has released the first look at Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in Season 2 of The Last of Us, and the scenery looks familiar. As Season 2 shoots are underway, images from filming have begun to leak, but today's images are the first official shots from the upcoming season, which is due out next year. 
Pascal's Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game's beginning where snow is abundant. 
Check out the first official look at Season 2 of The Last of Us for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.
Once a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The characters in Read Only Memories: Neurodiver are deeply into anime. They love manga and figurines and trashy movies and horror novels. The interests of the game's creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name ("Neurodiver!"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.

As he stepped off court for the last time, I found myself welling up. He doesn't know me - of course he doesn't - and I don't know him. But for ten years I'd watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn't only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his. And for a magical two years, he had the best game in the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi-Fi Rush is getting one final patch today to address some minor issues in the game. Plus, the Hi-Fi Rush X (formerly Twitter) account has reconfirmed a physical edition of the game is coming from Limited Run Games. 
This update from the Hi-Fi Rush X account comes roughly one week after Xbox shut down the game's developer, Tango Gameworks, alongside Redfall studio Arkane Austin, and two more Bethesda teams. While there won't be any more Hi-Fi Rush content coming from Tango Gameworks, hopefully today's patch puts the game in the best playable state possible so that future players can enjoy the 2023 hit. 
Thank you all for your continued support.
May 15, 2024
The closure of Tango Gameworks arrived roughly a year after the team delivered the extremely well-received Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. A few days after the closure of these studios, Xbox president Sarah Bond addressed the situation, stating that it's about keeping the business healthy in the long-term.

The first is that it's a brighter, glitzier version of Toby Fox's Undertale that looks like it belongs on Gameboy Advance - a retro parody created in GameMaker whose turn-based combat houses many an inventive minigame, and whose writing doesn't so much break the fourth wall as moonwalk along the parapet, showering the player in poop, anime tropes and off-colour mental health advice.

Right now it's a live-service game with microtransactions, but soon it'll continue as a paid co-op RPG with no in-game monetisation. And that's alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It's often you see paid games go free-to-play, but this is an unexpected switcheroo.

The first Mortal Kombat movie in this rebooted film series hit theaters on April 23, 2021, and Game Informer had a great time with it – read our 8 out of 10 review to find out why here. Here's hoping we enjoy the sequel just as much, if not more. 
Mortal Kombat director Simon McQuoid will return to direct Mortal Kombat 2, and it will be written by a new writer, Jeremy Slater (alongside McQuoid), who wrote Disney's Moon Knight series. Alongside returning cast and characters, The Boys Karl Urban will join the fight as Johnny Cage.

The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you're talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm's perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.
Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to "take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results". Other developers have heeded the call. Here's a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0's (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.

I really want to use the word ‘zany’ without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I’m afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, you've had 15 years to play that well-regarded time-bending puzzler sitting in your Steam library, staring at you this whole time. Well, now you can have another 15 years. Braid Anniversary Edition is out on Steam now, a high definition remastering of a classic indie. It got stuck in time following a few delays but it's finally defrosted now. The sharper look will appeal to pixel perfectionists, but there are also 40 new levels for serial rewinders. And - for those interested in the thought processes of designer Jonathan Blow - a bunch of developer commentary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you love the smell of napalm in the morning? If so, you'll probably love the smell of Valheim's Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after a period of beta testing. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very Possum-esque.

This one is mainly aimed at re-balancing an overly demanding new grudge system for the Dwarfs that punished players for stopping to enjoy a swift pint of Bugman’s instead of constantly being on the offensive, but also includes so many other fixes it’s veering into larger patch territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Casting of Frank Stone, the upcoming narrative horror game set in the Dead By Daylight universe by Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games, has its first gameplay trailer. The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. 
The story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. 


Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills
The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

From providing the voice of Rucks in Bastion to Red's titular Transistor to Hades himself, Cunningham has played a vital part of every Supergiant title. In this rare interview, we ask Logan how he entered the world of voice acting, how he joined Supergiant Games, and which characters are his favorites to play (and which he'd want to redo). 
Game Informer: When did you first discover that you were good at creating or imitating voices?

The latter doesn’t have a title yet, and is described as “a next-gen Life Sim that emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” According to former XCOM and Marvel’s Midnight Suns director Jake Solomon, it’s “focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”

Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen has been obsessed with that unassuming Tomato Convenience Store since he was a teenager, partly for the contrast it offers to the rest of the game. "Shenmue was a really depressing game, I would say - your father is killed, it's always raining," he tells me. "But there's one kind of super-healthy place in the whole game: a convenience store!"

        <updated>2024-05-14T15:29:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon has ordered a new Tomb Raider TV series to production, and it will be written and produced by Fleabag star and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who also starred in last year's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. 
This series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a "single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series." 
"With great IP, the possibilities are endless," Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. "The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us." 
This is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. 
If you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam's acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  

It's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.

This throwback first-person RPG is hazardous, and not only due to the dreamlike islands floating in the sky. My leg-snappin' plummet may be down to early access changes, causing the ground to be updated from right under my feet. Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dungeons & Dragons has a big year ahead of it. The classic tabletop RPG is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the most significant event of that celebration is undoubtedly the release of a revision for the game's core rules, including the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.
The books aren’t far off. Players and Dungeon Masters alike can watch for pre-orders starting on June 18; each book is set to be priced at $49.99. Each of the three new books comes in at a hefty 384 pages apiece.

The top contenders are currently trying to crack a difficult spot to reach the 12th floor, at which point the course will reveal unknown territory. They seem a little tired, which is not surprising.

        <updated>2024-05-14T14:21:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in its latest financial earnings report it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. 
Originally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. 


At 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. 
On the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, former long-time Firaxis designer and director who spearheaded Marvel’s Midnight Suns and was a lead designer on XCOM: Enemy Unknown, has announced he’s formed a new company following his departure from Firaxis last February. Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers. 
Midsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims. In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.


The company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” 
“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”
Midsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-14T13:05:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever, the company has announced in its latest financial earnings call. It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Developer Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. 


Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. 
As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!
@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…
May 14, 2024
Notably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella.

After that brief stint, PlayStation is tackling the CEO position with two figures, each with different focuses. 
Hulst has been appointed CEO of SIE's Studio Business Group while Nishino has been appointed CEO of SIE's Platform Business Group. Totoki, now through as interim CEO, will serve as a Chairman of SIE in addition to returning to his role as COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Both Nishino and Hulst will report to Totoki.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played little of legendary survival sim The Long Dark, or The Short Dark, as I guess it has proven for me. I fell off the game after succumbing to my first wolf. But I've sampled enough to know that adding a "Misery Mode" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.


It's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.

Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work.

Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's getting an "official cinematic world premiere trailer" debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.
Also, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mullets aren't just coming back into fashion, they're everywhere at the moment, adopted largely by lads who love draft beer and The Football. And seemingly by Mullet Mad Jack, the protagonist of a single-player roguelike FPS who would shove draft beers into the skull of a billionaire robot, then shoot him in the gonads. What I'm trying to say is, Mullet Mad Jack is fashionable and no-nonsense, which makes for a great hang if you'd like to burn some aggression once in a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, The Joker was announced as the first new fighter joining MultiVersus ahead of its upcoming relaunch this month. The reveal was purely cinematic, however, but today’s new trailer shows off his gameplay.
The video not only gives fans a sample of actor Mark Hamill’s new voice lines, but also reveals that Joker has an alternate costume modeled after The Batman Who Laughs. The video also shows what appears to be unique dialogue interactions between Joker and his long-time sidekick, Harley Quinn. 


MultiVersus has other new characters joining the fray that will be revealed over time. Following a lengthy hiatus since its open beta concluded last year, the game will return in an improved form on May 28.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus has announced that the original version of Shin Megami Tensei V will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13. That’s one day before the launch of its expanded definitive edition, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.
On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V’s Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it’s been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the best-selling game in the series in January 2022.
The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.
May 13, 2024
Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it’s likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game (including all DLC) but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons. Think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V. Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.
Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game here, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Manor Lords’ soundtrack begins, as all inspiring tales do, with hunched-over late-night doom scrolling. It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios’ composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He’d never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.

I think this has gotten worse (if that's the word?) with the increasingly popularity of BookTok, the book-centric community on TikTok. It's really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption's sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).

To fill you in, Fire Emblem is known and sort of celebrated for being a rich ensemble fantasy story with character permadeath. Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda. Put the two sets of inspirations together, and what do you get? You get a headline, that's what. Beyond that, we can only dream.

Something about ROBOBEAT’s roguelike shooting feels different though.

It's a grid-based, upwardly mobile roguelitey dungeon crawler set in a big tower, each floor a semi-randomised maze of monsters (which you can capture), traps and pick-ups, where player and creature actions happen simultaneously.
Effort Star's Enter The Chronosphere doesn't have grids or monster capturing, that I know of, but it taps into a comparable vein of diorama-sized frantic-yet-laidback challenge, with characters, foes and projectiles frozen in time till you give a command. There's a demo on Steam as part of the platform's Endless Replayability Fest, which I encourage you to try, whether you are one of the COOL KIDS who played Azure Dreams or not.

The pets themselves are technically not new to Abiotic Factor, but their player-tracking behaviour is.
