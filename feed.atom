        <updated>2023-10-31T21:34:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steelkrill Studio, creators of the popular horror games The Backrooms 1998, Trenches, and The Voidness—which just left Early Access yesterday—has announced its next title: Rotten Flesh. Steelkrill's previous titles are known for their uniquely creepy art-style, and it looks like Rotten Flesh will be no different as it features PSX-style graphics and gameplay.




ROY!


Rotten Flesh is an immersive cosmic horror survival game where the player has just lost their dog Roy. While trying to find Roy, players will have to shout "ROY!" in their microphone. As you venture deep into the sewers to search for Roy, calling for him will cause him to bark if he's nearby...but Roy isn't the only creature in the tunnels of the sewers who can respond to your calls. According to the release, players can  opt to toggle off the microphone input and instead switch to voice acting where players can push a button to call for Roy, but the microphone input is recommended.


I have to admit, it sounds like a pretty interesting concept, and utilizing the microphone can definitely setup some eerie moments, especially if something other than Roy responds to you calling out. It's great they've made the microphone input optional. But in a game like this, I feel like it will really enhance the experience.


In terms of the rest of the gameplay, it looks like players will be tasked with solving puzzles, hiding and stealthing past enemies, and managing their inventory as they find supplies, upgrades and health packs to survive the depths of the sewers.


Rotten Flesh does not yet have a release date, but can be wishlisted on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft is shutting down online services for 10 of their older games early next year. This includes a few older Assassin's Creed games on platforms like PC and Xbox 360, as well as Trials Evolution's PC servers.


This isn't the first time Ubisoft has elected to end online services for some of their older games. Although some may be displeased by it, eventually shutting down online services for older entries is common in the gaming industry.


The services are set to shut down early next year, on January 25, 2024 to be exact. Many noticed the abundance of big name franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Here are the 10 games players will no longer have online access to from Ubisoft.



Assassin's Creed 2 - Xbox 360


Assassin's Creed Brotherhood - Mac


Assassin's Creed Liberation HD - PS3, Xbox 360


Assassin's Creed Revelations - PC


Ghost Recon Future Soldier - PC


Heroes of Might and Magic 6 - PC


NCIS - PC


R.U.S.E - PC


Splinter Cell: Conviction - Xbox 360


Trials Evolution - PC



Assassin’s Creed’s multiplayer legacy


During the prime of older Assassin’s Creed entries, online multiplayer was a huge staple  in the franchise. Some of the beloved modes that fans of the franchise used to enjoy included PvP modes that allowed players to hash it out in intense stealth battles. There were even a number of different scenarios that could accompany these modes.


But, in newer entries, it is evident that the multiplayer aspect has become much less prominent. Some games, such as Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Assassin’s Creed Mirage, have completely discarded the multiplayer component that older entries once leaned on.


Although these games will no longer be available for online services, players will still have great memories of them.

        <updated>2023-10-31T20:18:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I wasn’t looking, the King’s Field-inspired RPG, Lunacid has exited Early Access and launched its full version. This happened yesterday, October 30, 2023.


Why doesn’t Steam tell me these things? The game is in my Steam library. Does Steam think I don’t want to know when an Early Access game I own updates to its full 1.0 version? An email would be nice.


Rude, uncommunicative storefront aside, Lunacid is a first-person RPG dungeon crawler inspired by FromSoftware’s 1994 PS1 title, King’s Field. King’s Field is considered the spiritual precursor to Demon’s Souls and its follow-ups. Since we haven’t seen even a hint of a re-release, the formula and aesthetic is getting picked up by indie developers, and Lunacid is an early example of it.


I’m not sure how to describe it. King’s Field is more of a vibe than anything. A gritty, gloomy,  claustrophobic dungeon crawler with a hint of unknowable horror. While Demon’s Souls borrowed that vibe, King’s Field (and, by extension, Lunacid) is not a soulslike game. They’re more focused on exploration than intricate combat.


Developed by Kira, it entered Early Access in March 2022, and was gradually built up from there. Lunacid is an excellent title in its own right. Don’t take my word for it. It currently has the coveted Overwhelmingly Positive review score on Steam. The developer seems like a cool, cool person. They have promised more bug fixes in the future and have teased that they are working on a prequel.


Lunacid is now available on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those looking to carry the spooky vibes over to the new year, Aksys Games gave Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II a release date. The third entry in the series heads to PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on February 15, 2024.


Death Mark II finds Kazuo Yashiki back in Tokyo's H City for more supernatural investigations. This time the mystery is swirling around Konoehara Academy, which has been host to a grim shroud since the first in a series of students disappeared. Yashiki has to pose as a teacher and search for any lingering clues as to the whereabouts of these missing students. A handful of side characters — including returning faces from Spirit Hunter: Death Mark— can assist in new 2D side-scrolling exploration sections. 


The official website is live now along with the Steam page for Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II. There's also a 14-track original soundtrack CD available for anyone who picks it up through the North American Aksys Online Store. You can see a sample of the new perspectives and more in the First Look trailer.

Still on the hunt


The series comes from Experience, the developers behind dungeon-crawlers like Demon Gaze and Stranger of Sword City. It kicked off with Spirit Hunter: Death Mark in 2017, with Spirit Hunter: NG following close behind in 2018. 


Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II was initially crowdfunded through Campfire, managing to more than double its goal for a total of over 30 million yen. We'll see how its new 2D sections and "Suspensive Acts" — which have you making choices under pressure — play out early next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While PC and PlayStation 5 owners are off adventuring, there's a large faction of players still awaiting the Baldur's Gate 3 Xbox Series X|S release. Larian Studios previously stated that it should be rolling out this year, but we've yet to hear anything definitive. 


Today, Larian's CEO Swen Vincke emerged to squelch any fears that may be growing from the Xbox fanbase.  Via Twitter/X, he confirmed that the title is being "actively playtested" and remains on schedule for 2023.




It was back in August that Vincke confirmed the game was still slated to make a 2023 release. However, the game would not make the same release window as the PlayStation 5 version as compromises (the cutting of split-screen coop) had to be made on the Xbox Series S version of the hit RPG. 


To that point, it appeared as though keeping parity across Xbox Series S and X was creating issues, as some have reported in the past. But when Baldur's Gate 3 became a smashing success on PC, Gaming CEO Phil Spencer decided that perhaps complete similarities across the Series X and Series S versions of titles weren't entirely necessary. 


With that, the Baldur's Gate 3 Xbox release is slated for late 2023. And since Larian's CEO confirming things are going well, Xbox players should be able to get their hands on the highly reviewed RPG at some point in the next couple of months.

Earlier today, Toby Fox celebrated the fifth anniversary of Deltarune's original release. He also provided an update on the highly anticipated third chapter of Deltarune. The newest chapter is playable from start to finish, but not ready to be released. "Obviously, releasing a game takes many more steps than just finishing the gameplay and graphics," states Fox. 


However, he mentions that work has started on the fourth chapter, which his team is very excited to continue. "When we started Chapter 3, to be honest, it took a lot…]]></summary>

After what has most certainly felt like an eternity for many of us, five of the mainline Metal Gear games are now available to Nintendo fans on the Switch via Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1. While it's perhaps not the most pristine package that we were hoping for, it's nevertheless a solid (ha!) compilation that provides the perfect entry-point for newcomers and a good dose of nostalgia for veterans.
With Konami now seemingly poking its head back into the world of 'AAA' game development after an extended hiatus, it's admittedly got us thinking: what exactly do we want from Metal Gear now? After all, a recent video featuring none other than David Hayter, voice actor for protagonist Snake, is causing waves in the community thanks to a rather intriguing promise that "this is only the beginning" (which, we admit, is likely just in relation to the 'Legacy Series' itself, but we can dream).

This review was originally published in November 2014. We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online NES library — and its official debut in North America nearly 40 years after its Japanese launch on Famicom.

As far as obscure releases within the NES library go, Devil World is certainly one of the most interesting. Originally released in Japan in 1984 and in Europe in 1987, this is a title that to this day has never been available to purchase in North America — not even through the wonders of Nintendo’s Virtual Console service. Nintendo of America originally passed on the title at the time of release due to self-imposed rules on the use of religious icons and themes appearing in its games. The subsidiary's stance has evidently relaxed since then, yet Devil World nevertheless remained in the depths of unreleased game hell in the region until its 2023 debut as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Headless enemies aren't exactly a new concept in games, so I'm not sure why the Headless in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice instills such dread in me. It's so terrifying to face that I almost didn't write this post, because I knew I'd have to drop into its heinous lair in order to take the screenshot you see above.
But I'm a brave boy, so I dropped in, and of course died almost instantly. Sekiro is still one of the toughest soulslikes around, absolutely filled with extremely dangerous bosses and twisted body-horror monstrosities that can carve you up with just a couple of hits, sending you back to the last checkpoint bereft of all your XP. But the Headless scares me so much, I actively avoid facing it until I have absolutely no choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is all show, no tell, which is a bold swing. Video game characters aren't often big on show don't tell in 2023. A lot of them have been cursed by their creators to narrate everything they do, as they do it, incase the meatsacks controlling them are unable to parse even one second of what is happening on screen without direction. I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.
In contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.

It can be annoying to see the trend being done to death, but it does illustrate that there is a genuine desire for non-violent games that calm you instead of stressing you out. Jusant is another one of those games, and it's a title you shouldn't ignore. I'd previously played the demo and was mildly impressed. After playing the full game, my opinion has only grown more positive, and I'm in love with Don't Nod's little experiment.

Jusant asks players to do one thing: climb. As a silent mountaineer accompanied by a cute critter, the only thing standing between you and your mysterious mission is one very tall mountain. The journey to its summit is treacherous, but thanks to an ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort. 
The intuitive climbing mechanics are the star of the show. Pressing the left and right shoulder buttons lets you grip handholds with the correspond…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little knowledge can be worse than no knowledge at all. I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019's turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.


It sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last April, it was announced that Max Payne 1&2 are getting remade with help from Rockstar Games. Now, studio Remedy Entertainment has said the project is in the next stage of development.


Hot off the recent success of Alan Wake 2, a recent note to investors outlines a number of titles Remedy is currently busy with. While Control 2 is still in the "proof-of-concept stage," Max Payne has "progressed into the production readiness stage."


Non-developers like me don't fully understand what this entails, but it sure sounds like things are moving forward for the remake. The note goes on to say that the studio has "gained clarity on the style and scope of the game" and is confident it has an "exceptionally well-organized team working on it."




Bringing the Payne once more


Released in 2001, the first Max Payne entry was notable for its gritty, noir storyline and Matrix-inspired bullet time mechanic. It was also only the second game by Remedy Entertainment, but it certainly put them on the map.


Following the 2003 sequel, the series went on hiatus until Rockstar took over the IP for the third installment, which was released in 2012.


We still don't know when the remake of the first two games will see the light of day, but progress is coming along, it seems. We know that both Max Payne titles will be releasing "as a single title" that will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.


With the warm reception Alan Wake 2 has received since launch, a lot of attention is on Sam Lake and the team at Remedy to see where things go from here. Many reading this will no doubt look forward to a modern retelling of the bleak story about a man whose name basically means "a large amount of agony."

With only 32GB of storage available within the system itself (or 64GB if you have a Switch OLED), Nintendo Switch has always had one significant weak point – storing digital games. MicroSD cards have therefore been an essential accessory for any Switch owner since the console's launch, and this new card is the best option we've had yet.
Trusted SD card maker SanDisk has released an all-new 1.5TB microSD solution, finally putting to bed any and all storage woes for Switch fans. Previously, the best option available was a 1TB card, with other sizes ranging from 64GB to 512GB also being popular (1.5TB is equivalent to 1,500GB).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire legendary port/remaster house Digital Eclipse. This is the latest of a long string of acquisitions made by the company.


This is perhaps the least surprising acquisition Atari has made in a while. Digital Eclipse are the developers behind Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, whose formula of contextualizing retro games with supplemental information was utilized in The Making of Karateka. The modern-day Atari (still technically a rebranding of Infogrames) is helmed by CEO Wade Rosen, who seems to have his eye on game preservation. Digital Eclipse is insisting that nothing is changing for them and that it's business as usual.


Digital Eclipse has been around since 1992 and has always been mainly focused on porting games…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GOG has announced that you can expect Sony's PC ports of God of War and Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection to come to the storefront. A launch date hasn't been given yet, though you're encouraged to check out GOG's Halloween sale as you wait. 


Sony started its push to put more of its games on PC a few years ago. Typically, they launch on Steam and then arrive on GOG a little later. This was the case with Horizon Zero Dawn which hit Steam in August 2020 before arriving on GOG in November of the same year. Similarly, Days Gone was ported to PC via Steam in May 2021, and it only arrived on GOG in October this year. 


Sony's PC ports have had varying quality. Horizon was well-received, while The Last of Us Part 1 was a bit more of a disaster. Fortunately, players using GOG won't have anything to worry about when it comes to God of War and the Legacy of Thieves Collection, as both games had successful launches on PC.


God of War (2018) is a soft reboot of the series. In addition to bringing back Kratos, his son Atreus is introduced which brings out a different side of the Spartan warrior. The Legacy of Thieves Collection offers the best of modern Uncharted, bringing you Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy in a single package. 


Sony's not done with PC ports just yet. The biggest one to look out for is Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition which is set to launch in 2024 and will feature the base game along with the Burning Shores DLC.

We don't have all that many details on this one just yet (neither a date nor platforms have been specified for the moment), but looking at the above teaser trailer, we reckon that Switch has to be a shoo-in for one of the consoles it is launched on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, gamers! Wanna feel old? What if I told you that the classic LucasArts title Grim Fandango just turned 25? Time is indeed marching on unabated. However, to offer some small comfort, you can now get the game's soundtrack on LP.


As spotted by TechRadar, the good people at iam8bit have launched a vintage black vinyl that features the remastered orchestral soundtrack to Grim Fandango. Not only that, but it comes with a "diecut cover" that has the many faces of one Manny Calavera.




While the soundtrack was released a few years ago for the game's 20th anniversary, this represents a chance to own it on a neat-looking vinyl set. It's currently priced at $42.99.


Perhaps one of Schafer's finest works (commence disagreements)


Released October 30, 1998, Grim Fandango is something of a relic of a bygone (and almost certainly missed) era of PC gaming. The story concerns the aforementioned Manny, a travel agent working for the Department of Death, selling luxury packages to souls as they make their way to the afterlife.


In typical 90s LucasArts fashion, the point-and-click narrative of the game was notorious for its convoluted, sometimes illogical puzzles. It was a simper time though, and any frustrations were quickly offset by the story's sharp writing, courtesy of Tim Schafer.


It's not too late to play Grim Fandango for those who missed out. A remastered version was released in 2015, which maintains its original look but adds some modern tweaks. To sweeten the deal a bit, you can get the game for a massive 75% off through Steam or GOG until November 6.

The odds were stacked against Castlevania Legends almost from the start. When it was released towards the end of the '90s, it had the near-impossible task of following Castlevania: Symphony of the Night - a game which had revitalised Konami's gothic series and won widespread critical acclaim.

Ahead of the premiere (release? Launch?) of the experimental Silent Hill Ascension tonight, we had a chance to speak with the developer Genvid about the game (TV show? Crowd-directed narrative?) is, what it will mean to the Silent Hill universe, and how much work is going into animating the versions of the narrative that may never be seen.
Calling Ascension a video game is almost a misnomer. There is an interactive element, but you won’t be holding a controller in your hand pushing characters to make decisions in the traditional sense. Instead, viewers will download the Silent Hill Ascension app on mobile devices or PC (there is a PlayStation option, but only for viewing episodes, not participating)…]]></summary>

The first (and best) of the bunch is The Mysterious Murasame Castle which was initially released in 1986 for the Famicom Disk System as part of the launch lineup alongside Metroid and The Legend of Zelda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoyed Resident Evil Village but thought, "hmm, I'd like this to be much closer to my face," I have some good news for you. The latest non-remake installment in Capcom's iconic series is now out on iPhone and iPad devices.


You can check out the launch trailer below. Basically, it's the full game (plus DLC if you want to go down that route) made playable on mobile phones and tablets. The game is compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and "all iPads with the M1 chip or later."




The trailer also states that the "story opening can be played for free," but you'll obviously need to pay for the full experience. The game thankfully features controller support for those don't fancy using the on-screen touch buttons (i.e. everyone). Even the App Store recommends using a control pad.


Staring at Lady Dimitrescu while on the bus


On top of that, Resident Evil 4 Remake is also coming to Apple products. We don't quite know when, but the App Store listing shows December 31 as a placeholder date. 


You can, however, pre-order the game. Much like Resident Evil Village, RE4 on iPad will require an M1 chip or later and iOS 17.


It's a grand old time if you're into horror games through your phone. While mobile gaming as a market tends to divide people, this could well represent the next stage in being able to play AAA titles on the go (Steam Deck who?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. 


I played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a "sleeping old one below". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.

        <updated>2023-10-31T12:01:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Toby Fox followed up their 2015 critically acclaimed and fan-favorite 2D RPG Undertale with Deltarune Chapter 1 in 2018. This chapter was the first in what we'd later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. 


With Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it's ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer "whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters," according to a new statement released. 
You can read Fox's full statement below: 
Elsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, "I already feel very confident about how we can progress." They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. 
For more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser. After that, read Game Informer's Undertale review. 
Are you going to purchase Deltarune with the release of Chapter 4? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery is why this took so long to be released outside Japan.
This review was originally published in June 2014. We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online NES library.

Although not originally released outside Japan, chances are that longtime Nintendo fans in the West have noticed nostalgic references to this unfamiliar title over the years. Takamaru's Ninja Castle in Nintendo Land? Murasame Castle mode in Samurai Warriors 3? Or perhaps some music in Super Smash Bros. Brawl? All of these, as well as some more in other games, are references to this very Famicom Disk System game from 1986.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fresh from the release of Alan Wake 2 - and apparently with a view to driving me nuts, because I haven't had a chance to play Alan Wake 2 yet - Remedy have shared some titbits about future projects. These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing "good progress", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.
Further afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that "crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy" Remedy's creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?

RoboCop: Rogue City has a lot of problems, but it also has a great deal of spectacular successes. Chief among them is the fact that it grabs a lot of the dangling threads of RoboCop 2 and finally gives them the resolutions they deserve. There’s bad news, however. The dev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 is finally out. It's quite the scary ride, and one our review-in-progress offered plenty of praise for as Remedy Entertainment went back for round two. However, Alan Wake 2 may suffer a few launch hiccups, as an annoying audio issue affects some Xbox players.


After the sequel's launch just days ago, player reports have included complaints about the game's audio cutting out with no apparent cause. While the problem has no clear fix, Remedy Entertainment has acknowledged its existence and stated that it's looking into a solution.




Remedy also released new patch notes regarding the new update today, bringing general bug fixes for the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions. On both consoles, the studio added localization fixes. Additionally, the Xbox version received tweaks for various visual issues and a problem where players would get soft-locked in interactions.


The Xbox version will also get what Remedy describes as a "significantly friendlier" error message when third-party software prevents the game from starting.


While some of those launch day woes may burden your early nightmares, there are more performance-friendly options to play Remedy's follow-up. Prior to launch, communications director at Remedy Thomas Puha confirmed both Xbox Series X and PS5 versions would feature different visual modes so players could choose what they value most out of the experience. 


You can now experience the full horrors of Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Grammy award-winning The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence are releasing a new cover of the Marvel vs Capcom 2 song "I Wanna Take You for a Ride." It's been covered many times by the VGM community, but in this instance, new verses and a bridge accompany the admittedly repetitive tune. 




Marvel vs Capcom 2 jam gets taken for a ride


Despite the original release from Marvel vs Capcom 2 repeating the same line over and over again, it's one with a special place in fan memories with a funky beat too delicious to ignore. Thankfully, The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence bring their own vision to the bop with a full song based on the loop. This version adds new lyrics, verses, and a bridge next month on November 10.


The 45 seconds released on social media from The 8-Bit Big Band has an outstanding suite of brass instruments and thrilling vocals. Almost time for MAHVEL, baby. 


Last year, the 8-Bit Big Band (and Button Basher) won a "Best Arrangement - Instrumental or A Capella" Grammy for its cover of "Meta Knight's Revenge" from Kirby Super Star. Since its release in 2021, the theme received over 1 million views on YouTube.


Perhaps with this upcoming Marvel vs Capcom 2 cover, they'll get another Grammy. Nevertheless, The 8-Bit Big Band has an upcoming show in New York on December 15. Its fourth album, "Game Changer," accompanies the Marvel jam on November 10.

Here, she could have simply worked away the days until she made enough wages for freedom. But an illness falls over two of the emperor's favorite concubines and their children, drawing Maomao's curiosity. And from there, events spiral out to bring Maomao further into the viper's nest of rear palace politics.


The Apothecary Diaries is certainly an interesting premise for an anime. If you're newer to these stories, you might think of battle arcs and isekai series with bizarrely long names, with a few surprises and lowlights. This year has surprised me with its vibes few tim…]]></summary>

But I recently had the opportunity to jump into  a two-hour hands-on experience of an earlier section of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, where I realized it is not just Far Cry: Blue Edition. Sure, there are similarities to the open-world formula that Ubisoft has mastered over the years. But Frontiers of Pandora also builds upon the formula, while also melding it to fit the world of Pandora.


In the two hours I got to play, I only got to explore a small portion of the world and experience and even smaller part of the story. However, in the two hours I also got a good feel for what developer Massive Entertainment was going for. In Avatar: …]]></summary>

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is the next canonical chapter of the Avatar mythos. Set during the one-year gap in Avatar: The Way of Water on the other side of Pandora in a new area called the Western Frontier, players control a Na’vi raised and trained by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) who finds themselves taking the fight to the corporation. That requires, quite literally, getting back to their roots as they reconnect with Eywa while learning what it means to be a Na’vi by ingratiating themselves with the game’s three new clans.

I don't mean that in a good way.


Fear Factor was a game show that was advertised as a show about people overcoming fear to both humiliate themselves and win money. I’m pretty sure people just tuned in to watch the contestants eat bugs, which was almost invariably what they did in the middle of the three events. But there are so many times you can air people cringing as they eat insects before even the least discerning audience gets bored, so the series only ran from 2001-2006. I say “only” …]]></summary>

Throughout my journey as Nunu, I had fought off evil wolves with Braum, commanded Krugs with Nunu's flute called the Svellsongur, and even forged a cauldron with the help of the legendary blacksmith Ornn. Song of Nunu was a pleasantly enjoyable voyage through the Freljord. And while it had its flaws, at the end of the roughly ten-hour adventure I was happy to have experienced it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slay the Princess is both easy to describe, and difficult to truly dig into. The best I can offer is a word-salad of genre titles and inspirations: horror meta-narrative visual novel with hand-drawn visuals and strong voice acting, something akin to The Stanley Parable meets Mundaun.


And it can get even more difficult to pin down as it goes on. Slay the Princess feels dreamlike, constantly shifting but staying focused on the drama and tension between its characters. It is simple to get into, but Black Tabby's words will linger in your mind long after journey's end.


So let's start at the beginning.

You don't need me to tell you just how charming Super Mario Bros. Wonder is. You only need to briefly glance at Twitter to see the same comments crop up repeatedly: the visuals are brilliant, the level design is great, the Badge system keeps things interesting, etc. And I agree with everyone online wholeheartedly — it is rather wonderful. But let's not be blinded by the shiny facade of the Flower Kingdom to the point where we can't see the bad seed growing inside — those flippin' Poplins.

Bungie has yet to reveal how many employees it laid off yesterday and it hasn't given an official reason why either. However, as more and more former employees have shared details about the layoffs, we continue to learn who else was affected. It's how we know famed Destiny 2 composer, Michael Salvatori, who also worked as a co-composer alongside Martin O'Donnell on games like Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and more, was either laid off or voluntarily left amidst the studio layoffs. 
It's currently unclear because, as noted by VideoGamesChronicle, Destiny 2 community animator Carson Reed claims he was laid off, according to their own internal sources, but Windows Central's Jez Cordon says he's heard Salvatori may have retired voluntarily.

If you preorder a digital version of the game, you can play through its campaign early, starting November 2. That's eight days before the full game's release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Ahead of that early campaign launch, publisher Activision Blizzard has released the PC specs and system requirements to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. 
If you've played recent Call of Duty entries, you likely already know what you're in for, and this year's is not all that different. But if you're new, or curious if you need to upgrade before this year's entry, we've got you covered.

Speaking to me in an interview about Hunt's evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game's general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won't be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won't come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. 
Now, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual "next-gen" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: "I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do."

        <updated>2023-10-30T15:23:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix revealed Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android devices, last year as part of its 20th Anniversary celebration, which is also where the company revealed Kingdom Hearts IV. Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. 
In the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. 
Check out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Square Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.
Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. 
For more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer. Check out this Sora Amiibo coming out next year after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking in a winter wonderland.
It’s been a busy year for Riot’s new Forge publishing arm, aimed at expanding its League of Legends Runeterra universe in games beyond the popular MOBA. In April, we got The Mageseeker, a hi-bit brawler set in the austere kingdom of Demacia, and in June, we got Convergence, a traditional Metroidvania set in the seedy depths of the city of Zaun. To finish out the year, the company has now published Song of Nunu, a narrative action game developed by Tequila Works, which previously developed RiME back in the early days of the Switch library. We’re pleased to report that Song of Nunu is yet another strong addition to the Runeterra universe, expertly combining a gripping narrative with enjoyable gameplay.
Song of Nunu is set in the Freljord, a harsh, frigid, mountainous region in the north of Runeterra, and follows the adventures of an energetic young boy named Nunu and his affable yeti friend, Willump. Nunu’s mother has gone missing since his camp was attacked by raiders and he keeps having dreams where she tells him to find “The Heart of the Blue” at the Winged Mountain. Aided by Willump’s strength, Nunu sets out on a quest to reach the mountain, where he expects to find some answers about what happened to his mother and hopes to be reunited with her. All the while, however, the two are unknowingly pursued by a dangerous ice witch named Lissandra, who wishes to use Willump’s unique powers to help her fight back against a shadowy force that threatens the whole Freljord.

I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.
But dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.

Take The Great Below, a new horror... thingmabob from Cantabria-based Dobra Studios. It's about exploring a strange house full of dreadful paintings in the dark. It's a 3D game with keyboard move-look controls, but the twist is that you can only move around while looking at a 2D map, with your position marked as a pair of footprints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When was the last time you played a good 3D character platformer? For me, it was probably Psychonauts 2. But before that? Outside of Mario? I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don't need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.

        <updated>2023-10-27T22:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Insomanic revealed its Wolverine game two years ago, fans have wondered if it’s set in the same universe as the studio’s Spider-Man games. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes
When host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.
You can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). 


Whether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.
Beyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I'd like to see the two game series share the same universe.]]></summary>

A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new gameplay video for Little Nightmares III offers a lengthy look at its two-player cooperative gameplay. Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. 
This pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as "Monster Baby". It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.


Unlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker but wish it had more blood, death and inclement weather in it, consider Sands of Aura. Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.
The sandship, or rather, "grainwake" sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending hours poring over Alan Wake 2 this week, corkboards full of photos, red string and important little clue nuggets have definitely been on my brain. Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. 
Happily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, "Objection!" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend.

RE Engine's successor, the REX engine, is a response to three things - 1) RE Engine productions getting bigger in terms of assets, and more diverse in terms of genre, 2) RE Engine games being increasingly made by overseas developers who speak different languages, and 3) unflattering comparisons with various commercial tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity.

In Free Range Games's plucky dungeon sim The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, you're a dwarf trying to reclaim the once-proud undercity of Khazad-dûm, tunnelling between procedurally generated networks of halls and crafting your own havens and upgrade facilities from long-wrecked forges and mansions. 


 The game is set after Sauron's defeat at the end of The Return of the King novel (spoilers, I guess?), at a time in Middle-earth canon when most of the big names were busy shaking hands and doling out promotions, but there are still plenty of orcs, trolls and other threats to worry about in Moria. Right now, though, the real headache is that I can't make my base of operations symmetrical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Square Enix decided to ruin over a decade's worth of CD collecting by sticking all of their incredible Final Fantasy Piano Collection soundtracks online, for free, on pretty much every streaming service imaginable. The sheer cheek of it! Honestly, I'm still mildly shocked by it all. Just the thought of all that brilliant music, available to everyone, for zero pence and import fees. What an outstanding gift to the world. (Well, the real gift would be re-printing the fabled Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collections CD and/or sticking that online as well, if you ask me, but hey, I'll allow them this one little omission). 
After all, there's an absolute treasure trove of music you lucky lot get to dig into now, so if you're wondering where to start or just fancy yet another guided tour through some of Final Fantasy's best music tracks, allow me to forcibly volunteer myself to regale you with some of my personal favourite highlights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl posited that humans are motivated, above almost all else, to search for meaning in their lives. He would probably be unsurprised, if more than slightly confused, to see that spirit manifest in a rumour that the rubbish performance of Cities: Skylines 2 is being caused by excessive teeth.


A widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this "bizarre story."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After weeks of in-game teases and more, Epic Games has officially confirmed that the next season of Fortnite will bring players back to Chapter 1. With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season's map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it's happening. 
Today's reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, "Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG" with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it's likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3.

        <updated>2023-10-27T12:49:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 other classic arcade properties. Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
"On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged," an Atari press release reads. "The latest entry in Atari's acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto's droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer." 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader's cinematic history because Robert Pattinson's suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

October 26, 2023
At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer's Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to "look at the image quality" instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.
Actually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek's Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter's wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0's enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You haven't even downloaded Remedy's Alan Wake 2 yet, assuming you're planning to, which means it's already time to start thinking about what you'll do once you've finished it. Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.
Remedy's plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka "Final Draft", which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake's fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves "an independent government organization" that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.

The list below outlines a handful of characters worth remembering before diving into the ocean that’s not a lake.
I fully acknowledge that simply being reminded of a character with the knowledge that they will be relevant to the sequel could be conceived as a spoiler. Some of the characters below appear in person, some only in passing in documents, but they are the ones that forced me to pause the game and do a quick Google.

But since the long-awaited sequel has been tossed around for over a decade, it's fair to assume not everyone has a clear memory of the events of the first game, and some people likely never got around to playing it at all. If that sounds like you, you're in the right place; here's everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.
Arriving at Bright Falls
The game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice. Wake is an author known for his Alex Casey novels, but he hasn't written anything new in three years. After being recognized in town several times by fans (especially Rose, the waitress at a local diner), Wake receives keys…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's multiplayer Jolly Rog 'em up Skull and Bones is caught on the reefs once again. Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it's now due to make landfall in the publisher's FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What's the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for "vapourware"? I'm picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.


The troubled naval combat sim isn't the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious "large game", originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week and it's already Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. 


Version 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: 
Addressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed
Addressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Addressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright
Improved stability
Developer Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. 
"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag," it reads. "We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future." 


Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about how Insomniac updated New York City for the sequel. Then check out this story about this missing NYC landmark in the game. After that, read our guide for the best graphics mode in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and then check out our spoiler-free tips.

Its release this week comes after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed the game 10 days earlier this summer. While there are plenty of visual options for players playing on PC – check out Alan Wake 2's PC spec requirements here – there are only two graphics modes for those picking it up on PS5 and Xbox Series X (and just one on Xbox Series S). But first, be sure to read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review.  
Below, we'll dive into the two graphics modes for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and then a handful of Game Informer editors playing the game will share the mode they've opted to experience Remedy's latest in.

        <updated>2023-10-26T14:54:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK, so there's plenty in Worldless that won't remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you're a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You're Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you'll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it's turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. 


So why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry's work? Partly it's the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you'll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it's the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it's the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you're beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless's release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.

Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place. I also encountered a number of bugs that forced frequent restarts and one full reinstallat…]]></summary>

It didn't quite land for us – Game Informer gave it a 6 out of 10 – but a new update that launches later today fixes one of the major problems we had with the soulslike. That's because the new Pumpkin Patch update that launches at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET today comes with reduced enemy density. Plus, the patch brings full crossplay to the game alongside performance and stability fixes and more. 
The Pumpkin Patch update also brings a special in-game Halloween celebration to the setting of Mournstead that starts today and ends November 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alan Wake 2 review embargo lifts today, but ours needs a bit more time in the oven. Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it's imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it's really sunk its claws into me good and proper. 
Alan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy's most sophisticated tale yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Microsoft revealed the launch of Starfield led to a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services revenue in its Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financials. Now, Capcom has released its latest round of financials – the six-month period that ended in September – and in it, reveals that both income and profit are up thanks to the excellent launches of its Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6. 
Total game sales are up from 21.3 million this time last year to 22.6 million units, resulting in a net sales increase of 53%, from 49,067 million Yen to 74,934 million Yen. Operating income is up 55%, too. As for why, Capcom points to the release of its Resident Evil 4 remake, which it released back in March, Street Fighter 6, which hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in June, and its Monster Hunter series. 


Resident Evil 4 has sold 5.45 million units, while Street Fighter 6 is at 2.47 million units sold. Monster Hunter Rise, with its Sunbreak expansion, has crossed 6.5 million units sold. Capcom has also revealed that its remake of Resident Evil 2 has sold more than 13 million units, with its remake of Resident Evil 3 sitting at 8 million units sold. The recently released Monster Hunter Now, a Monster Hunter take on Pokemon Go, has been downloaded more than 10 million times by players as of last week. 
Capcom says the entire Resident Evil series has sold more than 150 million units, with Monster Hunter crossing 95 million. The Street Fighter franchise sits at 52 million. Here are some other series highlights: 
Mega Man: 41 million units sold
Devil May Cry: 30 million units sold
Dragon's Dogma: 7.9 million

After the wait was extended by a 10-day delay, the game's release is almost here.

This New Game+ mode will allow players to retain all unlocked weapons and upgrades. Plus, it will feature a new Nightmare difficulty level and an "alternative narrative" that includes new manuscript pages and new video content. Remedy says it's due sometime after launch but that the release timing of it is still to be decided.

The game in question is, of course, Still Wakes The Deep from Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs developer The Chinese Room. Set off the coast of Scotland in the 1970s, it sees you navigating collapsing gantries and flooded rooms while avoiding an unearthly terror apparently extracted from the ocean floor. Mind you, the worst thing in the game could be the weather, which you can witness for yourself in the latest gameplay trailer below. Never mind the dreadful moaning on the other side of the pipes - how about that drizzle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell's sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map "powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline".
I've written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I've also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn't glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group's tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2008, Robert Downey Jr. debuted as Tony Stark in Iron Man. Outside of being an excellent movie in its own right, Iron Man proved to be one of the most influential films of the 21st century so far, paving the way to the biggest film and TV franchise of the last decade and a half, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.
At the time, "The Avenger Initiative" felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 is almost here. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this Friday, on October 27, after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed it 10 days earlier this summer. With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today's Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. 
In the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter's ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2's live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game's story. 
Check out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: 


Alan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2's beefy system requirements, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been curious about The Finals, Embark Studios’ game show-inspired free-to-play shooter, you can sample a taste of the game in an open beta starting tomorrow. First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. 
A new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.
The open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. 


Players will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. 
The open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.]]></summary>

 We got flying dinos, stalking dinos, and swimming dinos. You're hunting dinos, riding dinos, and hanging with dinos. And most notably, it looks great, having been rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5. 
Check out the trailer below:


Interestingly, Survival Ascended will have cross-platform modding on all platforms, as revealed in a post on the Xbox Wire. It looks like PC players will have the ability to actually make modes, as it requires the Ark Devkit, downloaded from the Epic Launcher, but playing mods will be available for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Xbox Partner Preview brought us a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake announced earlier this year. In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.
While what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the "first in-engine look." Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a "pre-alpha footage" tag.
Check out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. 
Revealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. 
Here are a few screenshots from today's showing:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a good look at Still Wakes The Deep, the new game from The Chinese Room, a studio known for projects like Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.
The new project has distinct horror vibes as it drops players into the shoes of a character navigating a ruined oil rig. A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.
The Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.
Nonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.]]></summary>

The game is billed as a momentum-based action roguelite, with players zipping around neon-soaked cyberpunk world dishing out rapid melee attacks while executing air dashing and somersaults to evade and outmaneuver enemies. Check out its first trailer below.

Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it's jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare's original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be "unfair".

        <updated>2023-10-25T13:06:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, Sony revealed new slim models of its PlayStation 5 hardware. Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. 
Some images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, "Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup."
Hey, @PlayStation & @cerny, we need to talk!
https://t.co/GacpULuDu0 pic.twitter.com/IIF1iB2zgV
October 25, 2023
Understandably, many players and video game preservationists aren't enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it's unclear if it's required after that. 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. 
The same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.
For more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won't come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.

Now, thanks to Microsoft's Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financial results, we know more than 11 million players have played Starfield to date. Starfield's excellent launch resulted in a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services. However, despite the financial boon on the Xbox services side, overall Xbox hardware was still down 7%. 
That's according to Microsoft executive vice president and chief financial officer Amy Hood, who also revealed during the financial results call yesterday that Xbox Game Pass experienced "better-than-expected" subscriber growth; Microsoft did not share any updated Game Pass subscri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines 2 developers Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive have penned a letter to their community about the game's launch performance problems and other technical troubles, sharing details of forthcoming updates and smaller bug patches while also assuring players that "the issues are not deeply rooted in the game's foundation". The developers include a few thoughts about what performance means for a management sim like Skylines 2, revealing that they considered delaying release to improve and stabilise the game, but felt that postponing launch would be "unfair" to those who are less bothered by such things.

By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” 



Pétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.

That fight produced a crowdfunded 414-page design bible but came to an end earlier this year when rights-holders EA rejected the pitch, and McGee declared that he had "no other ideas or energy left to apply toward getting a new Alice game made."

McGee reiterated similar sentiments in a new video discussing the project's end, but he did suggest one "ray of hope" to the community. "The design bible as produced is the perfect thing to feed into an AI system to have it completely build the game that is outlined in that design bible."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August, Night Dive Studios announced it was remastering the classic ‘90s first-person shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces. We now know that this modernization of one of the most beloved Star Wars games is coming on February 28. 
Night Dive, a studio specializing in reviving classic games such as its remake of System Shock that launched in May, is shining up the 1995 Star Wars title with 4K resolution and a 120 fps bump (on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC). Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.


Dark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. 
Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can watch some former GI editors play the original version in this classic episode of Replay, and learn about the making of Dark Forces in this retrospective feature.]]></summary>

Come now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit.

The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.
The game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puzzle game Suika, or 'That Watermelon Game', is currently having a bit of a moment online. It's been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it's taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It's also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I've been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It's a neat little time waster. It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. 
The goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I'd probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I'm honest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stretch and compress rooms to make your escape in Stretchmancer, a nice little puzzle-platformer you can play for free. Your heroic gecko is a Stretchmancer, see, able to bend the dimensions of spaces to push walls far away and draw distant objects near. This is handy when trying to defeat an evil space empire. Stretchmancer is in a similar vein to Portal: a first-person puzzle-platformer which uses one neat trick to change how you see the world, and builds on that while a baddie taunts you. It's short, it's free, it's fun, and you might enjoy it slightly breaking your eyes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines 2 is, much like the wonkily roaded, pollution-choked helltown I’ve built within it, a work in progress. Developers Colossal Order upped the citybuilding sequel’s system requirements well in advance of launch, and more recently admitted to have "not achieved the benchmark we targeted" for PC performance. Instead, future improvements are promised, to patch Skylines 2 into better shape.
I wish I could say that this is all just pessimism, born from an overabundance of caution and expectation management. But no, it is just a bit of a mess, one capable of putting freshly mixed concrete shoes on even the fastest graphics cards. I’ve worked out a best settings guide that, compared to the available graphics presets, can better balance performance and visuals – though be warned that this will feel more like urgent repair work than a dream remodel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 last week and it's already Sony's fastest-selling first-party game ever. However, some players have spotted a mishap related to one of the game's main protagonists, Miles Morales. His mother is Puerto Rican, and Miles is too, which is why some players found it odd that a Cuban flag hung both inside the Morales home and outside of it. After pointing it out the mistake, developer Insomniac Games has revealed a fix is on the way, as reported by PushSquare. 
In response to a tweet by Dantes61680 pointing out the incorrect flag, Insomniac's director of community and marketing James Stevenson wrote, "Fix is coming for that." As for when, that remains unclear – a post-launch patch for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has not yet been released but presumably, when the …]]></summary>

In parallel, Webtoon appears to be quietly laying the groundwork to tackle less-discussed competition; hundreds of pirate sites offering the company's content for free.

This is just a quick Codec to let you know that Konami's stealth blockbuster bundle Metal Gear Solid - Master Collection Volume 1 is now available to buy. Did you ever play Metal Gear Solid, Snake? It's this sprawling philosophical epic about war, surveillance, AI, nationalism and anti-heroism, a baroque metafictional saga spanning generations that is also a complex series of videogame design experiments. I know - it's a lot to take in, Snake, but you can sort of boil the series down to the difference between two varieties of wall. There are the ones you hide behind, so as to get the drop on your foes, and there are the ones you break, because they're fourth walls, Snake. Do you see?

In particular, Nesmith reckons it will "absolutely" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will "probably" retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.

There are beautiful 'pudding' keycaps, a compact and convenient 75% layout, tri-mode wired/wireless connectivity and hot-swappable key switches. Its US MSRP is a reasonable-sounding $70, but now it's available for a 50% off 'overstock' price on Amazon - that's just $35.

It was one of those shows you’d find in the 6pm slot on terrestrial TV, back when you had to show up for TV episodes on time or miss them forever, and as far as 10-year-old me was concerned, 6pm was Simpsons hour. Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?
I couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.

The game's latest patch, out now, allows you to choose whether to progress to a harder NG+ setting after finishing a run, or restart at the same difficulty threshold while retaining your character and progression. 


"This will allow trophy hunters and completionists to seek out any outstanding tasks without having to contend with increased difficulty, should they so choose," the developers say in Lords of the Fallen's latest patch notes. And these are just the first of "some fundamental changes to ensure everyone continues to enjoy the NG+ experience", according to Hexworks. Heft that magic lantern and read on.

Take Subpar Pool's cue ball. What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its 'Chonker'-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they're just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself. They make Subpar Pool a very easy game to like, which is precisely why it's so heartbreaking I can't quite bring myself to love it in the same way I do Grapefrukt Games' previous puzzle game, Holedown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. 


There's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.


I'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2020,  Amazon Studios announced that it was creating a Fallout TV series. Three years after it was announced, we now know that the show will premiere on April 12, 2024. Check out the short announcement teaser below.
PLEASE REMAIN CALM. An Important Dated Message Brought to You By Your Friends at @PrimeVideo. pic.twitter.com/yyaFynVjAK
October 23, 2023
As is the case with many high-profile video game adaptations, the project is attached to some pretty big names. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios' own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.
Over the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO's The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year. Hopefully, Fallout with follow suit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know some things aren't for me: The sitcom Friends, a small bowl exclusively filled with olives as a side dish, V-neck t-shirts. But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.
That's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you're into that, great! If you're not, then I'd slink back into that shadow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox will debut its new broadcast format, Xbox Partner Preview, this week where we'll hear from its third-party partners like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, Remedy Entertainment, Studio Wildcard, and more. This new show will feature more than 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage, and goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25. 
You can watch the Xbox Partner Preview on Xbox-owned channels for a look at games coming to both Xbox and Windows PCs alongside new information about some upcoming Game Pass titles from the company's third-party partners. While Microsoft finally completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard earlier this month, Xbox says the Xbox Partner Preview "will not feature any additional news, game reveals, or Game Pass information related" to the deal. 


Xbox says viewers can expect the latest information on in-game activities for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, a launch trailer for Alan Wake 2, the first gameplay for Ark: Survival Ascended, a "dive into the social world of Dungeons of Hinterberg," and more. 
The Xbox Partner Preview will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25 for roughly 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, catch up on Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and then check out our list of every Activision Blizzard game Xbox now owns. Read our thoughts on Alan Wake 2 after going hands on with both an Alan Wake gameplay section and a Saga section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.
In a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.
This feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it's off to a strong start regardless.

Over the decade since A Realm Reborn’s release, its reputation has grown with every single expansion. FFXIV’s producer and director Naoki Yoshida (more commonly known as Yoshi P) is now so synonymous with the game that it’s easy to forget he was only brought onto the project in 2010 - after XIV had been released, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Metal Gear franchise has been quiet since 2018's somewhat bizarre Metal Gear Survive. The series' creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren't sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.
The collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.
We had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:
