Now, I'm not interested in mulling over live service game failures here. That tired old topic's been tackled time and again to remarkable effect, and I've got precious little to add to the discussion. Instead, today's topic is kind of the opposite: the live service titles that succeeded and continue to succeed, but which we've got no real hope of actually finishing in the sense of thoroughly completing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 1979, George Miller's Mad Max series has transformed from a schlocky B-rate post-apocalypse story to one of the most beloved action franchises of all time. 


Mad Max is set in Australia sometime after the world has been desolated by plagues, economic collapse, and ecological die out. The dregs of humanity hang onto life and go to war over the remaining food, fuel, and shelter. The humans in Mad Max also spend a good chunk of their time creating spike-covered vehicles that can patrol the wastes and duke it out in high speed battles. It’s a goofy premise that takes itself entirely too seriously, but that’s part of the appeal. 


The Mad Max movies are beloved for good reason, but even super fans like myself have to admit that some of them are quite a bit better than others. They might…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who have been logging into Multiversus' online competitions and encountered an error, you're not alone. Many players have been stuck in offline mode and have yet to find a reason why. But fear not; we're here to guide you on what this could mean and possible fixes.


Multiversus stuck in offline mode, explained


One of the primary reasons you may find yourself stuck in Multiversus' offline mode is due to an age restriction. If your WB Games account is under 18, you can only access certain features, which keeps you offline. This restriction is likely in place to prevent younger players from making in-game purchases.


Image via Player First Games


It's important to note that you can't change your age directly in-game, as this feature seems to be tied to your WB Games account. Additionally, if you haven't updated the game file, you may encounter this issue. Multiversus was initially set to offline mode before its full release, so installing the necessary updates is crucial. This method is mostly catered towards those who have previously installed the game during its Early Access.  


It's important to remember that Multiversus is still in its early stages, and errors like this are more common at this phase. That said, it could mean that servers are currently down when attempting to join online. Follow the Multiversus page to stay updated on issues, including server downtimes.


If all else fails, check to see if your internet connection is stable. LAN connections work best, too, to help with laggy performances.

It's two minutes and 21 seconds of imagery that has me cautiously optimistic, and also unsettled by how many questions it has me asking.


"Witness me!" I scream for the 50th time


The trailer begins with what a lot of players have been begging for, seeing Guardians interact with the Last City's general populace. A boy stares in awe at a Warlock and their Ghost as they pass by, and we get a real sense that Guardians are these larger-than-life heroes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of speculation, Microsoft finally provided an update on whether Call of Duty Black Ops 6 would be on Xbox Game Pass or not. 


When Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023, it opened the door for new titles to be added to Xbox Game Pass. Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join subscription service in March, and players started speculating which franchise would be next. As rumors intensified, Microsoft reportedly had internal debates about putting Call of Duty on Game Pass because there was a risk it would hurt the revenue generated by yearly releases. 


Playing games on day one requires an Ultimate Game Pass subscription, which costs $16.99 monthly. Call of Duty games typically cost $69.99 or $99.99, depending on which version you purchase. The cost discrepancy forced Microsoft to weigh the benefits of each option, but a choice has now been made.

Microsoft confirmed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on day one with an Xbox Game Pass subscription. As for the rumored price increase, Microsoft did not mention a new price for the subscription service in the press release. 


Activision plans on sharing a first look at Call of  Duty: Black Ops 6 gameplay during the upcoming direct event on June 9 at 10 AM PST. The series of teaser videos has already hinted at it. Still, the next Call of Duty will reportedly be set in the Gulf War, “with a strong focus on the CIA,” and rumors suggest that Black Ops 6 will launch in late October.

LEGO revealed the build today, which is essentially a 2-in-1 set allowing you to choose between two Great Deku Tree builds from The Legend of Zelda.

Hey! Listen!


When did LEOG builds get so expensive? I will admit, looking at the build, I didn't expect it to have 2,500 pieces as the listing says it does, so that may just be the going price for that many bricks these days. I haven't had the opportunity to build out my LEGO dreams in way too long. *Pushes up non-existent bifocals* Back in my day a massive set of LEGO ran you $50 and featured a massive build.


Even though the LEGO Great Deku Tree set doesn't ship until September 2024, those interested can pre-order today if their willing to part with the price of a Nintendo Switch to get this set. It's a bit too steep for me, even though it would look pretty nifty as a piece on my shelf.


Those who pre-order by June 7 will also get a free Water Park gift, which absolutely does not fit with the theme of The Legend of Zelda or the Great Deku Tree, but hey, more LEGO I guess.


The Great Deku Tree confirms long-withstanding rumors that LEGO was indeed working on a Zelda set. While the Great Deku Treet is cool and is a great first choice, I'm excited to see what kind of sets LEGO cooks up based around some more memorable moments from the game series.

As usual, EA Sports has opted to provide different editions for the upcoming college football simulator.

Best Weapons for Mortefi 


The best weapon for Mortefi in Wuthering Waves is the 5-star Static Mist. The weapon fits him like a glove by providing a total of 24.3% Crit Rate when at level 90.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wuthering Waves has turned out to be a pretty solid addition to the gacha game lineup, sporting an intense combat system and a solid amount of power systems and collection mechanics that have kept me playing over its first few days. Still, like many game releases, not everything has gone smoothly, and the first few days since release have been plagued with issues.


Kuro Games has been working hard to correct many of these issues, and some patches have already started to roll out. To further apologize for the rough start, Kuro Games has also been handing out some goodies to players. The most anticipated of these is a voucher for a free basic 5-star unit.




How Do You Get the Free 5-star Voucher?


Getting the voucher is as simple as opening the mail. 


A letter will be sent to your mailbox, containing an item called the Voucher of Reciprocal Tides. Once you have acquired your item, simply go to the banners page and there will be an option to exchange the voucher for a basic 5-star unit. The units available are as follows: 



Verina


Encore


Lingyang


Jianxin


Calcharo



Players can also choose a 5-star they already own to get a node unlock on the character's Resonance Chain.


Players don't have to make the decision immediately, as the voucher is good through May 22, 2025. That said, for new or free-to-play players the free pull is more than worth using ASAP. I suggest pulling Verina to get the best-in-class support in the game, or Calcharo for very solid DPS, but each player is free to make a decision that best fits their party needs. 


Players will also receive 10 free Radiant Tides if they have reached Union Level 2 or higher, allowing them to roll for more chances at Jiyan. Between the free 5-star, these rolls, and the rest of the Lustrous Tides players receive throughout the game, no one should have trouble getting a solid team together for their journey in Wuthering Waves.

Team 17 and Catchweight Studio have revealed Conscript, a new survival horror set in World War 1 (or The Great War), heading to the Switch later this year.
No specific release date has been set at the time of writing, but if you want a taste of the action, a Steam demo will be made available from 10th June 2024. Judging from the trailer, however, it looks like the title takes a bit of inspiration from the critically acclaimed Signalis, which hit the Switch back in 2022.

But there's more, as her title as the only 4-star (and second overall) true-to-form healer in the game makes knowing how to build her just as vital as mastering your main DPS. To help you do that and awaken her full potential, here's the best Baizhi healer build in Wuthering Waves. 


Best Weapons for Baizhi


Thanks to her high Resonance Liberation energy cost, the best weapon for Baizhi is Variation. The 4-star rectifier is my main pick, given its ability to offer a 51.8% increase in Energy Regen (at lv.90). While at R1, Variation will also provide her with an extra 8 Concerto Energy following her Resonance Skill.

Certainly, Helldivers 2's exciting new mech (it's yellow!) is the talk of the town, but not in the way anyone expected it to be. Notably, the community appears to be unsure what to make of the Emancipator, generally speaking, as the mech has inherited all the issues its oft-forgotten predecessor has had since day one. The biggest concern, generally, is that Helldivers 2's mechs are made of plywood and glue, but the vehicle's autocannons aren't all they're made out to be, ei…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, "The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the ongoing Nightwave challenges in Warframe, players are sometimes asked to activate a Requiem Obelisk three times. It’s easier said than done if you know what to look for. 


That said, here’s where you can find a Requiem Obelisk in Warframe, along with a handy map to guide your way and how to activate them. 


All Requiem Obelisk locations in Warframe


A Requiem Obelisk can be found in the open world sections in the Cambion Drift on Deimos. It does not matter if you choose to play it as a Free Roam objective or through a Bounty. 


Once here, you’ll notice these broken-down spires that have the symbols that you can see on Requiem mods. Here are all the locations on the Cambion Drift map for reference:


Screenshot by Destructoid


The red circles above show where an Obelisk may spawn, but it isn’t guaranteed they’d always be there. However, there will be at least three you can find if you follow this map. 


You can also find a few, go back to the Necralisk or your Orbiter, then go again. But that can be a waste of time with all the loading screens. The time cycle in the Cambion Drift doesn’t mean anything either. The Obelisks can spawn at any time.


You can also find these Obelisks underground when taking on the Isolation Vault bounties. These count toward the weekly challenge, too. 


How to activate a Requiem Obelisk


To activate a Requiem Obelisk, you need to unlock your Operator or Drifter. With either one of them, use their respective weapon and shoot at the Obelisk. You can also use a fully-built amp for this to work as long as it deals Void damage. 


If done correctly, the Obelisk should reconstruct itself and attract a mob of Infested enemies. Upon the tower coming together, you should make progress in completing this Nightwave challenge. Do this three times, and the 4,500 Nightwave standing is all yours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, look. It's been a picosecond since the last Steam sales event. No doubt many of you took advantage of the last one – the Endless Replayability Fest. Well, don't put your money away just yet, as we're already onto the next one.


Beginning yesterday, the Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest (and breathe) offers discounts on a series of well-known and slightly less well-known games from, well, Open World Survival Crafting games. You've got until Monday, June 3 at 10 a.m. PT to choose from what I would say is a pretty good list of titles.




Take a quick look on the sales page to see for yourself. Want 30% off Sons of the Forest? Of course you do. How about 33% off Project Zomboid? An odd number, but sure! Or maybe you want to get Stranded Deep, Valheim, or Subnautica for 50% off each. Even Palworld is there, at 10% off the regular asking price.


Summer lovin'


These events seem to come around more often these days. However, we're not quite at the big Steam Summer Sale just yet. That begins in a few weeks. You can keep an eye on the SteamDB countdown if you really want to see exactly when it's scheduled to begin.


Crafting and survival games feel like they shouldn't be as popular as they are. But as we can see here, there are still so many offerings, largely from more independent studios. A lot of them are pretty decent as well, in my experience.


There are definitely more than a few in the sale that I'm keen to try out; Sons of the Forest, Project Zomboid, maybe even Enshrouded. Can I afford all these games? Check back with me later.

The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you thrilled about the possibility of a new Doom game? If you've clicked on this article, chances are good you're pretty pumped. There have been rumors about a new reveal for a bit now, and we'll find out whether it was worth getting excited soon enough.


According to an exclusive report from Insider Gaming, not only is there a chance that id Software could unveil a new Doom entry at this year's Xbox Games Showcase, the game's final title is said to be finalized. At one point, it was going to be called "Year Zero," but it seems as though it's going with "The Dark Ages." It's also said to have been in development for the past four years, so pretty much as soon as Eternal was complete.




The Xbox Games Showcase will be taking place on June 9, and will be a chance for Microsoft to discuss some exclusive games in its upcoming roster, though it's difficult to know exactly what's going to be on the schedule. The show will be immediately followed by a deep dive into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.


A look at the Slayer's past?


While details about the new Doom are pretty scarce, the report and video above say there's a chance we could be going back in time, perhaps to Medieval times. The title The Dark Ages  does suggest it could take place in that time period, giving us a glimpse into the Doom Slayer's life back in days of yore.


Of course, all expectations must be tempered at this point. As solid as these rumors sound, we're best off waiting until June 9 to see what's going to be confirmed. We're also hoping we'll get to see more Avowed during the showcase.


Playing my first Doom game as a young whippersnapper, I never thought the series would endure as much as it has. Although the team has changed over the decades, id Software's legendary FPS is not just trying to keep its head above the water; it's thriving in an increasingly competitive market. Here's to more demon slaying with whatever's on the horizon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty coming to Xbox Game Pass has been a topic of discussion since Microsoft's acquisition of Activision was announced. Now, Xbox has confirmed that Black Ops 6 will be on Game Pass from release day. 


Teasers for the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise dropped throughout last week, eventually leading to the official Black Ops 6 reveal on May 23. Now, on May 28, the official live-action reveal trailer has arrived, along with news confirming Black Ops 6 on Game Pass. 


In a post on the Xbox website, Microsoft confirmed that they were "excited to confirm that Game Pass members will be able to jump into Black Ops 6 on day one," a huge move for the series. 




Microsoft didn't go into any more details about the decision, pointing players towards the Black Ops 6 Direct set for June 9 that will follow the Xbox Games Showcase. There, Activision and Treyarch will "share even more details on what's coming in this all-new Call of Duty," including a first look at gameplay. 


While Microsoft president Sarah Bond had previously stated that all titles from their developers would appear on Game Pass, there was still some uncertainty around Call of Duty. While it was expected that older titles would be added to the platform, the decision to release this year's game on the service on launch day is huge, especially considering that CoD games regularly dominate the year's best-seller charts. 


How this will affect sales of the FPS title remains to be seen, but it marks a seismic shift for the franchise and could help to boost player count when people don't have to drop $70 to try the game out. With the success of CoD's free-to-play battle royale Warzone already bringing players back to the franchise, it feels like a golden age of CoD could be upon us again.

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

Couch co-op and JRPG are two genres you don't often see together. Secret of Mana is one of the earliest examples of the genre, with most of the Tales of series also allowing fans to play together while sitting side-by-side. But outside of those examples, playing JRPGs with your friends in the same room isn't a common experience.
Fortunately, Timesea Studio — made up of three brothers — is changing that. Nintendo Life can exclusively reveal that the developer's first game, Infinity Knights: Xross, is coming to Switch (and other platforms) in late 2025.

I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon. However, in February, I sat down with Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to discuss the addition of Ed to Street Fighter 6. During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6's case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

“My family’s from Cuba,” says Douglas. “It was my mom’s recipe that I have transformed into my recipe.

News regarding the upcoming Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been rather thin on the ground, but judging from a short tease posted on X to mark 'Dragon Quest Day', it looks like we'll be getting a lot more information very soon.
There's not much to go on from the tease, as it showcases a very short animation of the franchise's Mark of Erdrick, captioned with the short phrase "The legend of Erdrick draws near". Crucially, however, we do get confirmation that the game will be heading to the Nintendo Switch in addition to Steam, Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

Before we get cracking, let's see how things panned out last week, hm? We looked at Super Monkey Ball Adventure, one of several entries for the GameCube. As we'd expected, the busier, more vibrant box art from North America sealed the deal, winning a healthy 79% of the vote.

Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming," chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand," CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an interview with his parent company on Sony.com, Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann talks about AI and briefly teases Naughty Dog's next game. Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, "I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."
The interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, "AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games."
He also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a "beloved" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, "The truth lies," while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ setup is bland compared to the others in the puzzle genre.

The lack of context doesn’t matter, though, because the game immediately showers you with an incredible sense of mood. You may not know why you are petting the dog in the courtyard, checking every door, or reading every scrap of paper you come across initially, but you want to be there and see everything the game has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.


Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.
Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri).

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/22/hunt-showdowns-new-gen-console-update-arrives-in-august-rendering-last-gen-versions"/>
        <updated>2024-05-22T14:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. 
In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.
That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. 


In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. 
Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.

On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC
Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece (bundle that includes all the above compilations)
If you’re jumping into the series for the first time or returning from a long absence and have no idea how to decipher the bizarre names of these titles, here’s what each game includes:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories
Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)

This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the Epic Game Store since 2021. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.
The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would “aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.]]></summary>

The Mario brand of RPG represents some of my favorite adventures in the genre. The comedic tone, inviting art, and active battle systems have always been highlights for me, but Thousand-Year Door was a personal blind spot. I played prior and subsequent Mario RPGs, but I skipped it when the original was released in 2004, and notably was not yet employed at Game Informer at the time. With Nintendo remastering the acclaimed RPG for Switch, I welcomed the excuse to finally play it. I am impressed by how improved the…]]></summary>

Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice didn’t need a sequel. It had a clear story to tell, and it told it well with an artful (and tactful) execution of its mental health themes and a strong conclusion. But Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II builds a great case for itself by using the titular warrior’s growth to help not only herself but, for the first time, others around her, shining her in a fascinating new light. Refined gameplay and a jaw-dropping presentation make for a more wholly satisfying sophomore outing.

Street Fighter 6 is poised to wrap up its Year 1 character offerings with one of the franchise's most iconic fighters. Akuma brings his Satsui no Hado mastery to the renowned title this week. Introduced in 1994's Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Akuma represents the most classic post-launch character added to Street Fighter 6 during its first year of post-launch content, following Rashid (Street Fighter V), A.K.I. (Street Fighter 6), and Ed (Street Fighter IV/V).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Internet provider WOW has asked a Colorado federal court to dismiss an expanded piracy liability complaint filed by several film companies earlier this year. The ISP says there is no evidence to show that it received any piracy notices for the 300 new works added to the lawsuit. In addition, it believes that recent court verdicts support a dismissal of at least some of the claims in the multimillion dollar lawsuit.

It's the game that laid the groundwork for experiences like Bioshock, 2017's Prey, and many more in the genre, and the remake is both faithful and impressively contemporary. Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and me for a look at the game's opening moments on Xbox Series X and a discussion about the state of the genre that System Shock arguably invented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Player First Games and publisher Warner Bros. Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees and The Matrix's Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. 
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. 
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: 


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios, the team behind last year's Baldur's Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher's seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. 
"With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene," the company's announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. 


As for what those two RPGs are, don't expect a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian's CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur's Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur's Gate series in general. 
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. 
"Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw," the blog post reads. "Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that's why we've put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture." 
For more, read Game Informer's Baldur's Gate 3 review, and then find out why it's on Game Informer's list of the top 10 RPGs to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. 
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, "Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances." The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. 
FNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon
pic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST
May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25’s cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game’s first full trailer provides the look at it in action. 
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit. 


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades II has taken the gaming world by storm, and I'm not just saying that because it's the subject of our current cover story. But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it's still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

        <updated>2024-05-17T14:10:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. 
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. 


However, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. 
"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte," the story reads. 
Of course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. 
As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.

May 16, 2024
While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. 
The last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. 
On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. 
BioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. 
SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.
Publisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.
Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. 
Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. 
As we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.
You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.

Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following statement: 


Phoenix Labs released its latest game, Fae Farm, back in September, and Dauntless before that in 2019. 
These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year. 
Square Enix announced earlier this week it will begin layoffs as part of "structural reforms," starting this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports College Football finally has a release date, cover stars, and two different editions. The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.
Gracing the cover of the game’s Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.

The cover reveal comes a day before the game's full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it's being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.
Both editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. 
The $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.
Lastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-16T16:13:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new "narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise." The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. 
This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. 


"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas," a blog post reads. "The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. 
"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience." 
Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. 
What kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>
