If you're eager for more Gunvolt games, you might be waiting a while - with Inti Creates CEO Takuya Aizu revealing the Japanese developer will be taking a break from the series.
In response to a fan asking about future Gunvolt projects, Aizu revealed the series had come to a close "for now" while teasing a new project. Here's exactly what he had to say, courtesy of a translation by Noisy Pixel (along with some added clarification, reiterating how the developer is not entirely done with the series):

Last month, Nintendo bolstered its Switch Online N64 library with the addition of the classic title Pokémon Stadium.
Now, in a small development, it seems Nintendo has updated this particular application to Version 2.10.1. So, if you did notice your N64 library updating recently this is why. Unfortunately, there are no new game additions.

Earlier this year, Nintendo confirmed Pikmin 4 would be landing on the Switch this July. While the game is likely already complete, it seems Nintendo is curious to know what players want from this fourth long-awaited entry in the series.
As highlighted by VGC editor Andy Robinson, Nintendo is "doing some research" this time in hopes of bolstering the upcoming game's sales. As can be seen in the tweet below, a survey from the company behind the Switch asks what kind of game players would like Pikmin 4 to be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some employees say they weren't given notice
Ubisoft could see layoffs of up to 60 employees at two different offices, as part of an organizational shift. Both the North Carolina and Newcastle locations are impacted.
These cuts look to be happening in the Customer Relations side of Ubisoft. The publisher confirmed the job cuts in a statement to Eurogamer:
"Ubisoft's Customer Relation Center team is evolving its organisation to focus on where we can have a significant impact while remaining steadfast in our commitment to consistently support our players anywhere in the world. We estimate that, due to organisational changes, 60 team members from our offices in Cary, North Carolina in the US and Newcastle in the UK could be impacted."

Now-former employees on social media have said there was no notice given for these layoffs.
The future for Ubisoft
Earlie this year, reports indicated issues within Ubisoft, as the publisher was coming off a rough 2022. Ubisoft has had some struggles with free-to-play launches like Hyper Scape, and has cancelled a number of unannounced projects alongside delays for current projects. Additionally, games like Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023 underperformed for the company.
In March, Ubisoft said it was working on a "strategic reorganization" of its European business subsidiaries.
Ubisoft isn't the only games company that's seen layoffs this year, as others like Riot Games and Microsoft have also cut jobs. The publisher is still planning to host its Ubisoft Forward in June, where it will show a little of what's in store for the future of Ubisoft.

Game marketing has sure changed in the post-internet world. And while we can be grateful for the abandonment of those weird "lad's mag" years, there's definitely something of a yearning for the well (and not-so-well)-conceived commercials of the 1980s and 1990s. This was a time when context was absolutely necessary, where no answers or information could be found via a quick wander through the information superhighway.
The commercial had to do all the selling. No live streams, no banner ads, no YouTube previews, and no E3 visits for Johnny Public. You have 30 seconds to tell people to spend $50. Make them count.

Fortunately for Nintendo's premier fantasy franchise, The Legend of Zelda, its universe and characters exemplified magic, mystery, excitement, and adventure. Marke…]]></summary>

Sony has revealed the titles they’ll be adding to the Playstation Plus Extra & Premium tier catalogs. It’s, uh, some games. If you’re a member of one of the higher tiers, you’ll get access to the Dishonored games and the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy. Beyond that, there’s also more farming than you can shake a stick at. All of these will hit Tuesday, May 16.
Just to be clear, these are for the Extra and Premium tiers, which are higher levels than the basic level. Games under the extra column are available for anyone in the Extra and Premium tier to download and play. Premium also gets the classics, and normally they’d also get some PS3 games available for cloud streaming, but not this month, apparently.

Ever since we first rolled credits on Breath of the Wild, we have been eagerly anticipating what is to come next, speculating about who Link will be facing, what's the deal with his arm, and what the sequel will do to the Zelda timeline.
This long wait has meant that the anticipation for the follow-up is at an all-time high, but it has also meant that the details of what happened all those years ago are a little hazy — there was something about a giant smoky pig, and then an electric camel spat a laser at him?

Originally, this piece was going to be called "Animal Crossing on the GameCube is blatantly better than Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom". My plan was to take a 4/7th serious stance on the topic, not unlike this old essay on why I prefer Advance Wars to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.
It's an apples-to-oranges comparison and inherently farcical, but the sincere truth is that many of the things I grew up loving about Zelda (particularly its first 3 sequels) were best translated to polygons in the original Animal Crossing title. The grid segmented map, the feeling that every screen might have a simple-to-find secret hidden in a tree or behind a rock, the small but versatile set of tools, the inviting villages, the simplicity; they're all  key aspects to what made Adventu…]]></summary>

Asobo Studio has released an update for the PC and console editions of its grim, but unnervingly attractive sequel A Plague Tale: Requiem — Now available on PS5 and Xbox Series X, the new update adds a Performance Mode to the options, which offers a new 60 FPS option to both platforms.
The Performance Mode will increase the adventure's frame rate at the cost of some visual clarity, bringing the console editions more in line with the technical performance of the PC edition. Speaking of which, the PC version also has some new graphic options, allowing for further fine-tuning of 16th-century France, and bringing all of those grisly rats and mounds of rotten meat to, erm, "life." In addition, the update features a fresh round of bug fixes, which will also be applied to the Switch cloud edition.

Launching in the fall of 2022, A Plague Tale: Requiem follows the continuing odyssey of the de Rune siblings, Amicia and Hugo, as they search for a mysterious land that keeps appearing in the latter's dreams. While not quite for everybody, due to its stealth-heavy nature and oppressive and grim tone, A Plague Tale: Requiem is a fine follow-up to its 2019 predecessor, making up for its gameplay flaws with stunning visuals, interesting and engaging characters, and compelling performances.
A Plague Tale: Requiem is available now on PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch via cloud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.
In a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”
Does anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde
May 10, 2023
It might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.
Mortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry.

Geoff Keighley’s annual Summer Game Fest leads the charge with its main show as well as a number of smaller presentations under its umbrella.

To keep track of it all, here’s the current schedule of events taking place this June, which we’ll update regularly as new broadcasts are announced and solidified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fine vintage
Party for Introverts has revealed its narrative RPG, Cabernet, which is set for release on PC in early 2024.
Cabernet casts you as a 19th-century vampire trying to blend in with aristocrats. You explore the town and command a slate of classic vampire powers, like turning into a bat and hypnotizing people. You use these to steal the blood of rich people. Finally, a protagonist we can root for.
https://youtu.be/n-n87qBhCr8
Your character is new to the whole vampire thing and still hasn’t made the decision on whether they should hold onto their humanity or just go with that and have a feast. That’s not a hard decision for me. The game contains themes of social conflict, alcoholism, and corruption. Hopefully, this doesn’t get too in the way of eating the rich.
There is no indication that romance will play a role here, but we can always hope.
Sometimes PR people will seek out journalists who fit best with the subject matter of what they’re trying to bring attention to, then they reach out to them directly. That’s what happened here. I often don’t know why they talk to me aside from “actually reports on non-AAA games,” but I totally get it with Cabernet. I can barely last 5-minutes in a polite conversation without lusting over vampires. Well played, PR person. Now I want to know if I come up in a Google search for vampire-fucker or if I’m just on a list somewhere.
If you, too, lust for vampires and blood, Cabernet will arrive for PC in early 2024.

One of the best elements of every new Splatoon splatfest competition is the fun splash art that is daubed to announce the occasion, usually featuring the game's hosts dallying about with the subject matter of the splatfest itself. And if you, like me, are a fan of said art, then you'll be stoked to hear that Nintendo has gathered together each and every piece, newly curated in an online gallery.

The gallery features the artwork for almost every splatfest to date, from the original Splatoon all the way through to Splatoon 3, funkily daubed by the series' long-term art director Seita Inoue.
From Splatoon's Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, through Splatoon 2 rap-rock group Off the Hook — better known as Pearl and Marina — to Splatoon 3's trinity of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, each and every contest is accounted for. Ketchup vs. Mayo, Action vs. Comedy, Chicken vs. Egg, Movies vs. Books, and even the bizarre "Pocky Sticks with More Chocolate vs. Pocky Sticks with Less Chocolate.

At first glance, there seems to be a lot of artwork missing but be sure to click on the links on each piece to switch out for alternates, that way you can also see some of the licensed splatfests — special events that featured collaborations with brands such as Pokemon, TMNT, and Hello Kitty. It's definitely lovely to see all of this fun 'n' funny artwork once again, even though I can't help but feel a pang of wistful nostalgia for my gurls P&M. I'm glad that some of the old hosts make a cameo from time to time.
You can visit the Splatoon splatfest art gallery right here.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch. Be sure to check out the most recent splatfest results.

Granted, any site can post its own list of the greatest games of all time and you can probably bet that Breath of the Wild will at least sit around the top 10, but what makes this one particularly significant is that the list was compiled with the help of 239 experts from the games industry (from a total of 300 invites), including developers, directors, writers, streamers, and journalists.

The story follows Mimi, a young woman who returns to her departed grandmother’s countryside cottage in the real-life French region of Dordogne to uncover family secrets. Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion. 


Dordogne comes from developers Umanimation and UN JE NE SAIS QUOI and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surf or turf
Crunching Koalas and Dexai Arts have shown off their narrative bouncer game Techno Banter, which is coming to PC and consoles sometime this year.
I think Techno Banter is a narrative game, but none of the press material tells me how it describes itself. The trailer that dropped alongside the announcement at least points to this. There’s some first-person movement and talking to people, but no sign of, say, puzzles or combat. It mixes 3D environments with 2D pixel art characters, and the aesthetic is inspired by the Berlin techno scene.
https://youtu.be/d0hiE-LnOD0
Techno Banter casts you as a bouncer at a club. The gameplay focuses on deciding who to let through to enjoy the club and who to throw to the turf. Everywhere I look, Techno Banter keeps pointing out its “witty” dialogue. I’m not putting that in quotes to be disparaging. That’s actually how they describe it in the press release.
Constantly pointing to your own humor is a bit of a red flag for me. If you’re funny, you don’t have to tell people you’re funny. I don’t tell people I’m funny, but that’s mostly because it would be flagrantly incorrect.
The trailer doesn’t really show off any of this dialogue or even imply that it’s going for the humorous approach. However, it does show off an excellently executed aesthetic. I guess what I’m saying is I’m curious. I may not have a very clear idea of what Techno Banter wants from me, but I'm willing to give it a look.
Techno Banter is coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2023

Meanwhile, the PC version is getting enhanced graphics options that allow players to further optimize presentational performance. Lastly, all versions of the game, including the Switch cloud port, will receive bug fixes via this patch.
We enjoyed A Plague Tale: Requiem, with editor Wesley LeBlanc scoring the game an 8 out of 10 in his review, which you can read here. Will you be trying out these new graphics options? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

Sorry to start your day with a bit 'o'  glum news, but Team Cherry has announced that it is pushing long-long-long awaited adventure Hollow Knight: Silksong out of its "Early 2023" release window. The great-looking sequel remains in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
"Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong," wrote Team Cherry marketer Matthew Griffin on Twitter. "We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can. Expect more details from us once we get closer to release."
https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?s=20
The sequel to the award-winning 2017 bug-based escapade, Hollow Knight: Silksong was first projected as DLC for the original game, before the scope and scale of the project led Team Cherry to develop it as a fully-fledged sequel. Since then, it has become a bit of a running gag among the community, as a confirmed release date continues to evade the eager fans. This latest pushback will no doubt garner further sighs, but we can have faith in Team Cherry's ability to deliver the goods when the fateful day arrives.
Hollow Knight: Silksong will follow the adventure of the former antagonist-turned-friend Hornet, who finds herself a prisoner of the troubled kingdom of Pharloom. Utilizing her acrobatic abilities and deadly precision, Hornet embarks on a quest to escape the new world while learning of the reason behind her capture.
Hollow Knight: Silksong is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sixth consecutive year of growth for veteran developer
Capcom has released its latest financial earnings report, which records the sixth consecutive year of profit growth for the Resident Evil and Street Fighter publisher — The publishing of the new report has also affected the company's share value, which spiked to an all-time high earlier this morning.
According to the numbers, Capcom sold 41.7 million games for the period ending March 31, 2023. This number not only represents a 10 million sales boost from the previous year, but is also the largest year-on-year sales growth in the company's entire history. The boost in sales is attributed to two titles in particular: survival horror remake Resident Evil 4 and the epic fantasy adventure Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak.

These impressive sales figures also include the continued success of the Capcom catalog, with titles such as Devil May Cry 5, Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 2 & 3, Monster Hunter World, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. Capcom already has several more titles on deck for the remainder of 2023, including dino-hunter Exoprimal and handheld remaster Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. Capcom's biggest upcoming release, however, is inarguably Street Fighter 6, which launches on PC and console platforms June 2. The publisher has already set a target of 10 million sales for the new sequel.

The Capcom success story can be traced back to the launch of Monster Hunter: World back in the winter of 2017. Following a period of decline that saw disappointing launches for Street Fighter V and Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, Monster Hunter: World would not only go on to be the publisher's best-selling release of all time, but would kick off a series of hugely successful releases for Capcom, resulting in the most lucrative period in the company's 40-year history, as defined in today's report.

Capcom has released its financial report for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2023, and it's an impressive showing from the Japanese publisher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Cherry has delayed Hollow Knight: Silksong. 
The last we heard, Silksong was due out in the first half of 2023 but last night, Team Cherry delayed the game without offering up a new window. 
Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.
May 10, 2023
As you can see, it's clear Silksong won't be released in the first half of 2023 as originally planned, but there's no word or indication of what the game's new release date is. 
Team Cherry put out its first game, Hollow Knight, in 2017 and it was extremely well received. While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games. 
Are you excited for Silksong? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

We love a good video game commercial; especially one that manages to melt our black hearts and cause a salty discharge to emerge from our eyes.
The latest to achieve such a feat is a TV ad from Nintendo of Australia for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It starts off on a surprisingly somber note, featuring a man who clearly has the weight of the world on his shoulders, venturing home after what we assume was a fairly taxing day at work. After saying goodnight to his spouse, he sits down to play some Tears of the Kingdom.

If you're a fan of the Donkey Kong Country TV Series from the late '90s, then get ready for a sweet dose of nostalgia, because multiple members of the original English voiceover cast have reunited for a brand new animated short called 'DKC: Return to Krocodile Isle' from Alex Henderson Animation and Bootleg Dub Productions.
The short, available now over on YouTube, is just under 10 minutes in length (including credits) and features original voice actors Richard Yearwood as Donkey Kong, Benedict Campbell as King K. Rool, Adrian Truss as General Klump, and Ron Rubin as Kaptain Skurvy. All four reprise their roles from the WIC Entertainment TV series, which ran from 1997 to 2000 with a total of 40 episodes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Development is still continuing".
We've finally got an update about the anticipated release Hollow Knight: Silksong, but it might not be the news everyone was expecting.
According to Team Cherry's marketing and publishing rep Matthew Griffin, Silksong was apparently "planned to release in the 1st half of 2023" but development on the game is still going. The reason it's taking so long is because it's become quite a big project and the team wants to release it in the best state possible.

Believe it or not, but we're now less than 72 hours out from the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on the Switch. Nintendo New York is hosting a special midnight launch event and although there's a reservation system in place, some people are already lining up outside the store.

Game Freak and Private Division are teaming up for a new title. Take-Two's publishing label will work with Game Freak to publish a brand-new title, currently codenamed Project Bloom.
No details are available about the collaboration yet, as it's still in early development and has no confirmed release date. Today's press release states Project Bloom is expected to launch in Take-Two's fiscal year 2026.
Game Freak is well-known for its work on the Pokemon series, as it launched both Pokemon Scarlet / Violet and Pokemon Legends: Arceus last year. Still, it's not only a Poke-studio; Game Freak's also worked on several other games outside the Pokemon franchise, including Pocket Card Jockey and Little Town Hero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dash and leap
Atari is showing off their upcoming platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, which is set to launch this year on PC and consoles.
Mr. Run and Jump allegedly started its life as a homebrew experiment for the Atari 2600 at Graphite Lab, a frequent partner of Atari’s. Afterwards, the publisher liked what they saw and commissioned a more modernized take on it. It appears to be a fast-paced, die-and-retry platformer with neon visuals. In other words, its name does a pretty good job of summing it up! There is definitely some running and jumping going on here. Perhaps even some hopping, but no bopping. Bopping looks fatal.
https://youtu.be/VHIpL5Mz1JY
I’ll be honest here, I’d be more interested in seeing the homebrew original in action. That’s not a sleight against Mr. Run and Jump, I guess I just think that a game made in the constraints of an old console is more fascinating than a 2D platformer made on modern hardware. I'm also not a huge fan of the die-and-retry genre, and that includes classic examples such as Celeste and Super Meat Boy. Just not my jam.
That said, I dig the style on display here. The neon visuals fit in with what Atari seems to have been going for recently, which is sort of a modernized re-interpretation of what could be pushed in the primordial days of consoles. It also looks to be in a similar vein as Graphite Labs' previous game, Kombinera. I never played it, but it was very well-received.
Mr. Run and Jump is looking to drop this year on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Atari VCS (the modern one).

Dungeons are the time-honored challenge of many Zelda titles. Whether it's a giant mechanic contraption, a hidden temple, or the literal insides of a giant fish, the Zelda series has many dungeons we remember, fondly or not.
As part of our Zelda Week coverage, I asked the Destructoid staff to choose a favorite from among the many, many dungeons of The Legend of Zelda series, and to write a little bit about why. Whether it's the contraptions, tools, or boss fights therein, there are plenty of reasons to love a dungeon here. Let's dive into it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division has announced a new publishing partnership with Pokémon developer Game Freak. It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. 
Codenamed "Project Bloom," Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: 

"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work," Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. "From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future." 
Take-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, "We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market." 
Game Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. 
Private Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more.

You know, I gotta hand it to Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. These games ensure I’ll never run out of things to do.
I mean, this Friday only has The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and a beta for Diablo 4 coming out, so I was worried that I might fit some sleep in sometime this weekend. Sure enough, Game Freak had decided to throw its hat into the ring and give us another Tera Raid event for trainers to bash their head against too. I’m sure the residents of Hell and Hyrule will understand that they'll have to wait another day before I visit.
Timing musings aside, 7-Star Chesnaught will indeed make its appearance in Paldea from May 12 to May 14. Adhering to recent tradition, it will reappear from May 19 to May 21. Unlike previous events, I imagine the rerun weekend…]]></summary>

The Entertainment Software Rating Board, or ESRB, has released its rating for Bethesda's upcoming sci-fi RPG Starfield. There's little surprise that it garnered an M for Mature rating, but it's the details of this rating that have been fun to read about today.
As part of its rating process, the ESRB lays out both its letter grading and reasoning. Among the descriptors, there are: Blood, Strong Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Drugs, and Violence, as well as In-Game Purchases. While that last one could spark concerns over microtransactions, it might also be signaling potential DLC or cosmetics. It's not out of the question, considering past Bethesda RPGs.

[Note: This piece was originally published in 2021. We're bumping it now, as part of our Zelda Week coverage in May 2023, in the lead-up to Tears of the Kingdom. Enjoy!]
Thirty-one years ago, The Legend of Zelda became the first video game I ever beat. A year later, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link became the first video game I ever quit.
To be fair, I didn't finish too many games in my elementary school days. We owned maybe five titles total for our NES, and everything else was rented. So most games I played in the early '90s were returned before I got the chance to see the credits roll.
But that's not what happened with Zelda II. Sure, it was a rental to keep me occupied for another stormy Western Washington weekend, but I gave up on it…]]></summary>

Oh no. The listing includes several examples of post-coital pillow talk, and they are about sexy as you would expect from the studio whose dialogue is best known for inadvertently spawning memes about mudcrabs and knee injuries.

So what does it deal with? Bugs, mainly! This isn't a content patch, as it's meant to smooth over some of the rougher edges on all platforms. Several PC-centric issues are addressed, but it's a far cry from "the big one" that fixes hardware-specific issues. Other fixes are platform-agnostic, and include save state errors, streaming issues, and progression-halting bugs.

The word 'Metroidvania' might rub some core gamers the wrong way, but it's a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map. As you explore and find secrets throughout the environment, these games empower the player in a way that makes them extremely addictive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not just a novelty
Bitwave Games has announced that Gimmick! Special Edition will be coming to PC and console on July 6, 2023.
Initially released by Sunsoft in Japan in 1992, followed by a very limited release in PAL regions as Mr. Gimmick in 1993, Gimmick! is a game cherished by NES fans who are in the know. The PAL version is among the most expensive NES cartridges on the system and isn’t cheap on the Famicom either. As such, a modern port has been a long time coming.

Gimmick! has you play as a horned, green blob who can throw stars. While it’s simple on the surface, it requires you to master the heavily physics-influenced gameplay. It can be a rather tricky game that requires you to become intimately familiar with its movements.
I’ve personally bounced off Gimmick! More than a few times, but I know a number of gamers who are passionate about it. Gimmick! Special Edition is looking to preserve the gameplay while bringing a few extra tweaks alongside. There’s a speed-run mode and some other quality-of-life upgrades (that can be disabled). There’s also a save and reload function so you don’t have to complete the game in one sitting. Beyond that, there’s the now standard rewind feature to smooth over the more difficult aspects. If you found the original version too punishing, this could be your chance to finally finish it.
Gimmick! Special Edition launches on PC, Switch, and PS4 on July 6, 2023. The Xbox version will follow shortly after. There are physical versions of the games coming for Switch and PS4, and they’ll be arriving at retailers later this year.

The developer behind Pokémon GO, Niantic, has today revealed its latest game, Peridot. This is another AR-based title, it is true, but it looks to be a marked step from the 'mon-based gameplay that we all know the studio from (thanks, Eurogamer).
Instead of catching fantastic creatures and using them in battle (which really sounds weird when we phrase it that way), Peridot is all about raising a fictional pet and seeing it flourish in the world around you. The game uses an AR technology that Niantic has been working on for many years to accurately register objects and textures that you point your phone at, before working out how your virtual pet should interact with it.

We are just days away from the official release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on 12th May, and Nintendo has just published a special 'Ask the Developers' interview to provide a better insight into what's in store.
The interview discusses a range of topics from building on Breath of the Wild to the intricacies of the building process, but one strange point that stood out to us was the emphasis that the developers seemed to put on hands in the game, even going as far to describe it as the title's "key theme".

At the time of writing, the Switch has the highest number of software sales of any Nintendo console, ever, with over one billion games sold on the platform since March 2017. What's more, its lead is so commanding that it will likely hold this pole position for a good few years to come (unless there is a sudden surge in sales for DS games around the corner that nobody saw coming).
Of all of the games available on the Switch, a select few have been able to make it into the elite club of surpassing one million units sold. This is a feat that has only been achieved by 65 first-party games as of March 2023, with titles ranging across the breadth of the Switch's lifespan, and recent additions including Fire Emblem Engage, Metroid Prime Remastered, and Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe.

The series, which consists of 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn and its Frozen Wilds expansion, 2022's Horizon Forbidden West and this year's Burning Shores expansion for it, and the recently released PSVR2 exclusive title, Horizon Call of the Mountain, has quickly become one of PlayStation's best selling. In a new PlayStation Blog post detailing Guerrilla's history, PlayStation reveals the Horizon franchise has surpassed 32.7 million units sold worldwide. 


It also reveals that Horizon Forbidden West has sold more than 8.4 million units as well. 
"Millions more around the world have discovered Horizon thanks to PlayStation's subscription services and initiatives, including PlayStation Plus and Play at Home," Guerrilla studio director and art and animation director Jan-Bart van Beek writes in the blog post. "All told, it's a milestone we never imagined possible twenty years ago when we first started making games.
"The reception has been staggering, and we're grateful to the community for the continued love and support for the franchise."
The blog post ends with van Beek teasing that the studio "cant wait for you to find out where [Aloy] will go next."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elephant never forgets
Armor Games Studios has announced that they’re bringing a collection of John Cooney’s Flash games back in The Elephant Collection.
Do you remember Flash games? I don’t, but a lifetime of self-inflicted concussions will do that to you. For those like myself who only house a big blank space, Flash was an animation platform that some internet denizens would twist to make games. It was ahead of its time, putting powerful (but flawed) tools in the hands of everyone.
Hold on. A number of repressed memories are returning to haunt me....
Newgrounds was the nexus for these experiments, and The Elephant Collection compiles a number of high-profile games from those days. Each of these games stars a blue elephant, and many of them are a subtle (or not-so-subtle) commentary on the games industry at the time. These include the mind-bending This is the Only Level and the more on-the-nose Achievement Unlocked.
https://youtu.be/-Hf91nIk3zI
With Flash getting sucked down the Adobe tube and replaced with a disparate selection of other platforms that don’t have quite the same security issues, a lot of people have been left trying to preserve what is at risk of being lost. In that regard, The Elephant Collection is an important glimpse of a part of the past that could otherwise be forgotten.
To be clear, Newgrounds does still exist, and these games can still be run using the Newgrounds Player. That would be the site’s own (effective) attempt at preserving its content. The collection, however, will upgrade the quality of these games, rather than just present them as-is. I’d just warn caution in re-visiting Newgrounds, as its reminder of better days may suck you down memory lane. I’m seriously getting kind of misty-eyed here.
The Elephant Collection is coming to PC sometime in 2023.

        <updated>2023-05-09T13:51:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.
Just like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, "hella broken," and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.

Creative Bytes Studios has announced their next game, Return to Grace, a sci-fi adventure about restoring an AI. It’s set to release on May 30, 2023.
What’s that? You don’t want to save an AI because they might steal someone’s job? Understandable. But what if it’s a ‘60s interpretation of an AI? If that’s more your speed, then step into the boots of Adamari “Adie” Ito, and get ready for a retro-futuristic adventure.
https://youtu.be/2ipja8eFd1M
Return to Grace puts you in the year 3820AD where Adie is looking into the disappearance of “Grace,” an ancient AI that was once known as “humanity’s most significant technological achievement.” There’s absolutely no way that it could have turned evil or be remorseful. Right?
Fall from Grace will have you solving puzzles on Ganymede. There are multiple endings depending on your “playstyle and decisions.” The developer is also touting that the game is fully voiced, and you’ll be joined by a “cast of character AIs” that will “provide humor and perspective.”
I dig the art-style here. Creative Bytes Studios was formed by some former Silicon Knights staff. Dave Evans and Paul Caporicci are prominent, with both having worked on Too Human, while Paul Caporicci goes back to Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes. While I’m mostly a fan of Silicon Knights’ Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem, I appreciate the heritage.
Return to Grace is currently slated for PC. It drops May 30, 2023.

Atari has today announced that it is bringing Graphite Lab and Heavy Horse Games' Mr. Run and Jump to Switch later on this year.
This is an action-platformer that seems to put the stress on 'action' (and on 'platformer', now that we think about it). You will play as the titular Mr. Run and Jump, a fluorescent stick man who embarks on a perilous journey through a neon-soaked world to defeat the evil Void and find his missing dog, Leap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced a new action-platforming game called Mr. Run and Jump, which promises to be a speedrunner's delight. With lush neon graphics and reflex-based platforming stages, the game promises fast-paced and frenetic action for fans of the high-speed, tight-controlling entries of the genre.
As Mr. Run and Jump, you explore the Realms of Color on a quest to defeat Void and find the hero's missing dog, Leap. The title was originally created as a homebrew title for Atari 2600 in 2021, but a modernized version is now being released by developers Graphite Lab and Heavy Horse Games through official means. If this sounds up your alley, you can check out the announcement trailer below.


Mr. Run and Jump offers dozens of unique levels across six different worlds, as well as several enemies with distinct attack patterns and personalities. According to Atari, the title will offer more than 30 hours of gameplay when you take into account time trials, collectibles, and achievements.
Mr. Run and Jump arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year. For more on one of Atari's most recent successes, check out our review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One billion Switch games sold to date
Nintendo has revealed the newest sales figures regarding its Nintendo Switch platform, which sees the console pass the 125 million unit mark, as well as hitting an all-time record in regards to software sales.
According to the data, 3.07 million Nintendo Switch consoles were sold during the first quarter of 2023, (ending March 31), which pushes total unit sales to 125.62 million. While an additional three million sold Switch consoles is not to be sniffed at, it does represent a huge 22% sales drop on the previous year, continuing a downward trend for Switch hardware sales in general. At this rate, it seems very unlikely that the Switch will surpass the sales of Nintendo's best-selling hardware, Nintendo DS, which closed on a staggering 154 million units — making it the second best selling console of all time.
Nintendo is openly aware of the sales decline, but still hopes to sell a further 15 million units by the end of March 2024. Speaking in a conference call attended by Bloomberg, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa called the target "a bit of stretch", but hopes that the holiday season will help the company to hit its targets. Furukawa said that no new or upgraded hardware was being factored into the prediction, somewhat furthering whispers that the company has no plans to release a new edition of the Switch in the near future.
In regard to software sales, Switch has shipped 1.036 billion games since its launch, which is the most titles ever shipped for any Nintendo platform. The three best-selling first-party titles remain Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (53.79 million), Animal Crossing: New Horizons (42.21 million), and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (31.09 million). Nintendo's next major release, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, launches this week, and is expected to carry the lion's share of the company's software revenue for 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every PC* needs fans, so why not pick up some of the best value options for a historic low price? Arctic's P14 140mm fans are great performers as both radiator and case fans, although they're intended primarily for the former. They've attracted strong user and critical reviews since debuting a few years back, as they offer a good balance of airflow, pressure, noise and price, and now you can pick up a five-pack for just £22 - a solid £5 off their normal cost, and the cheapest they've been since 2020. 
*OK, there are some passively cooled PCs, but most of us have at least one case or radiator fan contributing to our airflow needs!

[Update: These titles are set to be removed imminently. If you still wish to record their respective licenses to your PSN account, then you need to do it right now. As in Right Now.]
Sony Interactive Entertainment has confirmed that it will be closing down its "PS Plus Collection" this spring — The collection represents a selection of 19 best-selling PS4 titles, readily available to all PS5 PlayStation Plus subscribers. Access to the library will end on May 9.
The PS Plus Collection is a who's who of PS4 hits, and includes titles such as God of War, Batman: Arkham Knight, Bloodborne, Resident Evil 7, The Last of Us Remastered, Until Dawn, Fallout 4, Days Gone, and Monster Hunter: World, among many others. Given the pedigree of the titles on offer,the collection is certainly one of the most inviting aspects of the PlayStation Plus subscription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEsLzh0xLZc&ab_channel=PlayStation
SIE confirmed that all registered titles will still be readily available to players after the collection is removed, so be sure to jump in and "log" all the games from the PS Plus Collection before the fated date — That way they'll always be available to redownload from the PlayStation Store, because you don't have enough of a backlog already, of course. All titles will also remain available for purchase.
PlayStation Plus launched its revamped, tier-based subscription service in the summer of 2022. This variant of the classic service, structured to compete with the Xbox Game Pass service, offers PlayStation users access to a variety of brand-new, recent, and classic PlayStation games on a monthly basis, with rotating titles, beta access, and other bonuses.
The PS Plus Collection will be removed from the PlayStation Store on May 9.

The EVGA Z12 is the firm's rubber dome offering, and it's down to £20 at Amazon UK, a heavy reduction from its £60 RRP and a few quid less than it's been over the past few months.

Redfall is my biggest disappointment of 2023. As a massive fan of developer Arkane Studios’ previous work, from Dishonored through Deathloop, my expectations were high for the company’s new release. However, this vampire-hunting first-person shooter is messy, plagued with technical flaws and head-scratching design decisions counterintuitive to the game itself. The result is an often-bland experience, made frustrating by occasional glimpses of potential, and it’s sucked the life out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. 


What I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, fans will finally get their first look at Payday 3's gamplay, according to a new teaser trailer.
This teaser is the latest following a similarly brief trailer released in January. Today’s video succinctly states that the first look at gameplay will arrive this summer. Odds are it will debut during Summer Game Fest or another adjacent event, but we’ll have to await confirmation to know for sure.


Payday 3 has been in the works for a long time, having been officially announced in 2017. It hasn’t had the smoothest development cycle due to developer Starbreeze Studio flirting with closure at one point, among other factors. So far, we know that the co-op heist shooter is coming this year for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It stars the original gang from the previous games and unfolds in New York.

Darkest Dungeon II is cruel. A simple miscalculation or bad luck can ruin your two-to-three-hour expedition before the chapter’s final boss. There are no checkpoints; if your party dies, it’s time to start fresh from the very beginning. Only some unlocked upgrades stay with you. When you have to make tough choices all the time while keeping in mind various systems, this can (and will) be frustrating and nerve-racking. At the same time, Darkest Dungeon II is the most cathartic and rewarding experience since the original in 2016.
Much like its predecessor, you create a party of four distinct heroe…]]></summary>

They describe the game as "fun, campy and spooky" and hint at yet more secrets to be revealed. Appropriate for a game where, every time you start a new run, one of the townsfolk starts killing everyone else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

It was a wide-ranging interview, looking at what Solomon plans to do next now that he's left Firaxis, and how he feels about his 20+ year career there. You can read the condensed version of that interview here, but as a treat for RPS supporters, I thought you might like to read our chat in full. There's still a lot I couldn't quite squeeze into separate news stories here, and I think (and hope) you'll find it interesting to read as a whole. So here it is. All 8760-odd words of it. Enjoy.

Ploughing through several emotions without comment, in amongst the games that we never got to see as a result of Things Happening was an earlier version of Lunark, a clearly Flashback-influenced action puzzle platformer.
I've kind of worried about it ever since, so I was glad to see it released recently, and gladder still that it's a lot of fun.

Shortly before release, Valve bestowed it with Verified status for the Steam Deck, a coveted green tick that represents more or less complete compatibility and suitability for the portable PC. 
I wouldn’t normally curl an eyebrow at this sort of thing – having more great Steam Deck games is good for PC gaming – but given how all-over-the-shop Redfall’s performance is on desktop PCs, could it really settle in on the less powerful Deck? A few ambulatory vamp slaying jaunts later, I can conclude that it... maaaaaybe can. Sort of.

Flashes of Arkane's brilliance make an appearance, but they are a rare find amidst a bland, incoherent world that clearly points to deeper issues in a game that's been drained of its magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Tell Me Why, has announced that its next title, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie, is coming this June and will get a playable demo this month. 
Steam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. 


Polly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. 
Harmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.
For more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.]]></summary>

“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”
Spencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take one look at Luna Abyss and you'll probably go, 'Wait a minute, this looks like first-person Returnal!' And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. 
There's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.

While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is not a good game. I don’t think you need me to pour salt on that wound if you’ve spent significant time with it. But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  
There are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…]]></summary>

Thus we discuss DLCs in general and what the difference is between a live service game and a game that is supported with DLC for years. As usual, we all talk about what we've been playing - what's up with Redfall, y'all? - and have some recommendations. The mini-game this week is to imagine feeding beans to Quentin Tarantino.

The Big N haven’t gotten around to it yet, but indie developers Rokaplay and Firechick have beaten them to the punch with Super Dungeon Maker, which just released out of early access. It’s what the name implies: a game where you can build your own classic Zelda-like dungeons, share them online, and then play through other people’s whacky creations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   


Beginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. "We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to," he says. "The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally."

When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being "point designers" for certain characters. "Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero," Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. 
Both are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards. But when I ask Solomon at GDC if he thinks he has a particular design 'style' that unites his crop of Marvel heroes, he says he loves being "bombastic".

On May 23, players can embark on an adventure as Lana, joined by her cat-like companion, Mui, to rescue her sister. The game is set in an alien world teeming with strange creatures and dangerous robots, which Lana and Mui overcome by working together to solve platforming puzzles or sneaking unseen in stealth. Planet of Lana occupies a similar space as games like Limbo and Inside, though with a decidedly more vibrant presentation. Check out its new trailer below. 


Planet of Lana was first unveiled at E3 2021 and is being developed by Wishfully and Thunderful. It was originally supposed to launch last year before suffering a delay. The game is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. It will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

Park Beyond is not just a complex theme park management sim, or a physics-ish coaster builder (although it is both of those), it's also an anti-physics weird-ride expando-game, allowing you to unlock increasingly unrealistic upgrades for rides in a process the developers Limbic Entertainment call "impossification". Deets on how to get your code for the closed beta below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced that a standalone version of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered will hit PlayStation 5 later this month. 
Previously, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered was only available by purchasing the Ultimate Edition of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Later this month, anyone will be able to play Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. Players will be able to purchase it standalone or, if you own Marvel's Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 (or its Digital Deluxe Edition or Game of the Year Edition), then you can pay $10 to upgrade to Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered on PS5. 
This remaster is perhaps most famous for introducing a redesigned face for Peter Parker, but it also includes The City That Never Sleeps expansion starring Black Cat as well as some exclusive Spidey suits, such as those from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Owners of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales can still obtain Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered by upgrading to the Ultimate Edition through the main menu of the PS5 version of the game. If you're looking to buy the remastered game standalone, it will cost you $49.99. 
PlayStation says this standalone version and upgrade path is coming later this month, but it doesn't say exactly when. 


In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Marvel's Spider-Man and then read our thoughts on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

And then, strangely enough, the voice actor behind the game's Venom hinted on Twitter that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be released this September.

That's because on Free Comic Book day, which is this Saturday on May 6, PlayStation will release a prequel comic book for Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.
Set in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. 


According to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). 
Double Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. 
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Well, Arma 3 developers Bohemia Interactive are taking a punt at blending the two genres with Silica, in the hopes that you can both shoot and command things with equal levels of good. It's the first project to hatch from Bohemia's incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.
Silica is largely the work of one developer, Martin "Dram" Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia's Take On Mars. Having given Silica a whirl for over an hour, I struggle to see whether the RTS, FPS hybrid can truly offer the best of both worlds. It does, however, make being a crab extremely good.

Playing as a student, you're free to decide how to spend your free time, which characters to spend it with, and who to inevitably romance by the end of the game. Plenty of options, for sure, but Persona 3 Portable was the last time we could choose our protagonist’s gender in the series. Until now. Thanks to the simply titled “P5R Female Protagonist” mod, you can now replace the default male protagonist Joker in Persona 5 Royal with a she/her Joker. On paper, that would seem like a novel change in a lot of games, but in the mammoth-sized Persona 5, a change like that requires some very impressive modding.

Having played the vampiric FPS for a clutch of hours now, I'd say it feels more like an "absence". Arkane's latest strikes me as an open world shooter with a few simple strands that never seem to go anywhere. Occasionally, there are flashes of a team that - as we all know - are capable of brilliance, but Redfall has me following a path of irritation, and feeling a slight sadness for what might've been.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Firaxis Games has revealed the release date for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of its 2022 strategy card game, Marvel's Midnight Suns, alongside news that the planned Switch version has now been canceled. 
Midnight Suns hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2, 2022, with plans for the PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions to launch at a later date. Today, Firaxis announced that the PS4 and Xbox One versions will launch next week on May 11, which is the same day the game's fourth and final DLC – Blood Storm, which introduces Storm as a playable hero – releases. 
As for why the Switch version has been canceled, Firaxis doesn't provide anything more than, "Note that a Nintendo Switch version of Marvel's Midnight Suns is no longer planned." This follows news from earlier this year that the game's director (and the director of Firaxis' modern XCOM games), Jake Solomon, is departing from the studio. 
PS4 and Xbox One players that purchase the Legendary Edition of Midnight Suns or the game's Season Pass will get the new Blood Storm DLC as well as all previously released DLC, which alongside Storm adds Deadpool, Morbius, and Venom to the game.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Midnight Suns review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite experiences of 2022, and as it approaches its first anniversary on May 5, the team behind it reveals it's begun work on its next project.
Gareth Damian Martin, the solo developer behind Jump Over the Age, is again joining forces with indie publisher Fellow Traveler, character artist Guillaume Singelin, and composer Amos Roddy on a new game. There’s no information about what this next title entails, but the team promises to reveal more in the “near future.” The coming days serve as a celebration for Citizen Sleeper, with the game receiving a 33 percent discount on PC and Switch starting May 4. 
Citizen Sleeper is a sci-fi choice-driven adventure where players guide a robot possessing a human consciousness through life on a space station, fighting for survival while also helping the lives of its inhabitants. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with editor Wesley LeBlanc writing that "Its hopeful and inspiring message is backed by a branching, heartfelt narrative, and a great gameplay loop, making it tough to put down. Add in its enriching visual style and my favorite musical score of 2022 so far, and Citizen Sleeper is a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." Citizen Sleeper also earned a spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022. 
Citizen Sleeper is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

The four men, seated on tall Hollywood director’s chairs, were estimated to be worth a combined $11 billion - and that was in 1995 money.


Together, Dreamworks and Microsoft were going 50-50 on a new game studio, investing a total of $30 million. “I’m spoiled,” said Spielberg, as recorded by the LA Times. “I worked with the best studios and the best actors, and it would be silly to get into the interactive business without Microsoft. They’re the best company in the world. It does seem like a marriage that was destined to happen.” It was a marriage that would produce a famously strange child in Jurassic Park: Trespasser.

When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. 
"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie," he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals "we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much."

Unlike other many video game movies, Gran Turismo is actually based on real events. The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan. The film follows the teenage Mardenborough's ascension from, as the poster below puts it, gamer to racer and all the trials that come with it. 















	



  
    

  
      
            


      
  













Mardenorough is portrayed by Archie Madekwe and the film also stars David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Djimon Hounsou. Neil Blomkamp sits in the director’s chair. 
Gran Turismo premieres exclusively in theaters on August 11.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first played co-op third-person shooter Glitch Busters: Stuck On You at Summer Games Fest last year, and came away really impressed. I played with couch co-op with two members of developers Toy Logic, which was lighthearted, slightly chaotic fun; everything couch co-op should be, right?
So, I thought I'd give the game a whirl but as a solo player. How would a game built for up to four players cope when there's just one person taking the reins? Well, sort of fine for a bit, then quite agonising, actually. That's not to say it can't be a fun time, but bots definitely aren't a substitute for real people.

Yep, embroidered as in using needles, thread, and fabric to stitch together every animation in real life, from the protagonist's big jump to a sheep’s wagging tail. This stitching is then scanned into the game by developers Attu Games, creating a uniquely beautiful platformer with a slightly physical touch.

Street Fighter 6 may feature thrilling 1v1 fights, but one of its most exciting features is its World Tour mode. This single-player sandbox story mode is a dramatic shift in what the series has offered, and players recently got to sample a small slice in a recent demo. On a trip to Capcom’s U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, I ventured beyond the demo for a more comprehensive look at what World Tour has to offer.

I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.
In case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.
Writing this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. 
As a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. 
On a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. 
However, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.

We’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a pretty great game that, unfortunately, isn’t running as well as it could be for some players. The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update. 
The PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering" in the patch notes. 
That doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it's worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:
Multiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.
Fixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.
Performance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Fixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis
Fixed various rendering issues.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.
Fixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.
Fixed various collision issues.
Fixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.
Fixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.
Fixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.
Fixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. 
Hopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you’re playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today’s update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Super Mario Bros. Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. 
The film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, and Jurassic World Dominion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. 
Developer poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. 
“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.
If you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. 
Vampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game. You can read our review of Vampire Survivors here.]]></summary>

Original Story: The live-action Twisted Metal TV series got its first poster today, courtesy of IGN, ahead of a teaser trailer scheduled to drop later today. The upcoming adaptation of the classic PlayStation car combat series is set to premiere this July. 
Twisted Metal is being developed by Peacock and stars Anthony Mackie as protagonist John Doe, a “smart ass” delivery driver who transports supplies between settlements in a post-apocalyptic America. He has no memory of his past but gets a chance at a better life by making one special delivery across the dangerous landscape. 
We have the exclusive new poster for @Peacock’s #TwistedMetal show starring Anthony Mackie.

Tonally, the series is billed as an action comedy. Other characters include Sweet Tooth, who will be voiced by Will Arnett and physically performed by pro wrestler Samoa Joe. The cast also includes Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church, Richard Cabral, Tahj Vaughans, and Neve Campbell. The show is being produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and it's the second TV adaptation of a first-party PlayStation game to arrive this year following The Last of Us. 
Twisted Metal premieres on July 27 exclusively on Peacock and consists of 10 half-hour-long episodes. We'll update this story with the teaser trailer when it becomes available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lego and Nintendo have announced four new Donkey Kong sets joining the Super Mario lineup. 
Lego has continued to build out its Nintendo universe of sets with Super Mario and now, hot on the heels of The Super Mario Bros. Movie's release in theaters earlier this month, Donkey Kong (a major character in the movie) is joining the lineup. More specifically, four new sets, each available for purchase starting August 1, are coming and they feature Donkey Kong and some of his family members like Cranky, Diddy, Dixie, and Funky. 
Those four sets are Donkey Kong's Tree House Expansion Set, Diddy Kong's Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set, Dixie Kong's Jungle Jam Expansion Set, and Rambi the Rhino Expansion set. 
"The excitement continues to grow for the Lego Super Mario franchise with yet another playful update," Lego Group design director Simon Kent writes in a press release. "We're welcoming the iconic Donkey Kong into the LEGO Super Mario product line. We can't wait to see how the four Expansion Sets inspire kids to discover the new wild and colorful jungle from the Donkey Kong universe, whether that's hanging out in the tree house, riding a mine cart, jamming out with Dixie Kong, or exploring with Rambi." 
Let's break each of these sets down:
Donkey Kong's Tree House Expansion Set
$59.99
555 pieces

Diddy Kong's Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set
$109.99
1157 pieces

Dixie Kong's Jungle Jam Expansion Set
$26.99
174 pieces

Rambi the Rhino Expansion Set
$10.99
106 pieces

All four of these sets will be available from Lego and select retailers on August 1, 2023.

The turn-based anime RPG did exactly that earlier this week, and it's already been downloaded over 20 million times in just a single day, according to a tweet from analyst Daniel Ahmad. Perhaps not surprising for a free-to-play game, but still. That's a lot of people. I must admit, I could never quite gel with Genshin Impact, another very anime RPG made by the same developers, but Honkai's turn-based battles look a lot more up my street. So I downloaded yesterday, which I guess makes me part of that enormous 20 million number. Are you planning on giving it a go as well?

Shardpunk Verminfall is, as Graham reported, an excellent mash-up of several familiar games and concepts, yet doesn't feel like a knockoff of any, or lack its own identity. I would resent it a lot less if it wasn't also a roguelike. Even with its standard mono-save system and unlocking things and "repeating the whole thing from scratch ad infinitum" though, I can't pretend I don't enjoy it anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve revealed a swathe of new features coming to Steam's desktop client beta last night, and there are lots of new features that caught my eye. They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game's performance in Unreal Engine 5. 
Layers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games' DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called "The Final Note" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: 


Layers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word "Lumen" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects "to create particle effects in real time" and Action System Controls "to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics," according to a press release. 
"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality," Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. "It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity." 
Layers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June.

That's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world.

As you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. 
The trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: 

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall, the vampire FPS from Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, is out in less than a week and to prepare players for what awaits, the team has released a new launch trailer aptly set to a cover of Soundgarden's "Black Hole Sun." 
It's a nice cover, and it goes quite well with what's happening in Redfall, Massachusetts, as a total eclipse has made it a haven for the game's enemy vampires. The launch trailer itself is more of what you'd expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda. Listen to our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with Redfall after that. 
Redfall launches on Xbox Series X/S and PC next Tuesday on May 2. 
Are you picking up Redfall next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores serves fans a substantial dessert that brings the main course of the campaign to a satisfying close. A dangerous new sandbox and a compelling story await Aloy, offering a nice wrap-up that also provides some tantalizing glimpses into the future. 
Unlike Zero Dawn’s Frozen Wilds DLC, which was a good but skippable side story, Burning Shores has enough relevant plot advancement to make it closer to required playing. Taking place immediately after the sequel’s conclusion, this abbreviated tale sees Aloy travel to the volcanically fra…]]></summary>

It comes from Dimfrost Studios and features gorgeous (if not terrifying) visuals and a fun loop of traversal and puzzle solving. And fortunately, you don't have to wait long because it hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC tomorrow on April 27.

In the game you, as a dog, must direct an endless stream of humans as they mindlessly walk forward. It's up to you to make sure they reach safety. Join Charles Harte and me as we play a few puzzles (without revealing the final solutions) and make sure Humanity can live on. At least, I think that's what the game is about.
As a bonus, the game is also fully playable in VR using PlayStation VR2, so we took the time to show off that version of the game, as well. It is functionally the same, but it's nice to have an alternate, encompassing way to play.

If the only thought in your mind upon completing 2019’s Jedi: Fallen Order was that you wanted more, then I have excellent news. Picking up where its predecessor left off, Jedi: Survivor isn’t just more of the same but more of virtually everything, with meaningful advances and improvements across the board. It’s a longer game with greater levels of customization, more enemies, more diverse approaches to combat and puzzles, and more storytelling and character development for its compelling cast of characters.

The sequel to the influential 1992 adventure game was first announced in 2021, but we haven’t seen much of it since its last teaser at Summer Game Fest last year. Today’s video provides a look at how hero Conrad B. Hart (and his A.I.-powered weapon A.I.S.H.A.) faces off against the shapeshifting aliens known as the Morph once more. Though the action largely retains its 2D roots, the game now sports 3D levels for more depth of movement, especially during firefights. Flashback 2 is helmed by original creator Paul Cuisset alongside the development team at Microids Studio Lyon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. 
More specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. 
As for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. 
Here are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: 
Revenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)
Operating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)
Net income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)
Xbox hardware revenue is down 30%
Xbox content and services revenue is up 3%
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%
These results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HeR Interactive’s The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill are now ready for testing in ScummVM!
The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.
