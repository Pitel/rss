Hell, for a blissful but fleeting moment in the early 2000s, even Nintendo got in the habit of regularly releasing GameCube preview discs. The discs, 3.1 inches in diameter, would make a handful of trials available for buzzy games. But like Heelys, low-rise jeans,…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The heavily rumored remake of The Last Of Us was officially revealed, and it hits PlayStation on Sept. 2.
This news comes from Wario64 on Twitter, who seemingly spotted a link to PlayStation Direct that houses pre-orders for the game, which is now called The Last Of Us Part 1, and its official reveal trailer. As you might expect, it looks gorgeous. The remake will also include the entire game and the Left Behind DLC. Plus, it's also in development for PC, but it doesn't seem like the PC release will be happening simultaneously with the PS5 release. 
You can check out the trailer for yourself below: 


The pre-order page reveals the standard PS5 edition will cost $69.99 while the special Firefly Edition will cost $99.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He's Like the Wind
With the arrival of each recent DNF Duel character trailer, I've been left thinking "That's probably about it" and yet publisher Nexon continues to surprise us with more and more pugilists debuting in the flashy-looking fighter — Today sees the arrival of the young and powerful mage: Swift Master.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzL-iMD_ckg&t
As demonstrated in the above trailer, Swift Master holds fearsome control over the winds, which he uses to manipulate and confuse his opponent on the battlefield. Of diminutive stature and mischievous nature, Swift Master's battle plan appears to involve using bursts of air to attract, deflect, and launch his opponent, following up with an array of air combos and juggle-enhanced specials. Swift Master looks very set-play based, and as such may prove to be one of DNF Duel's more complex but dangerous characters.
With the arrival of Swift Master, the DNF Duel roster has reached a healthy total of 14 highly unique characters, which is nothing to be sniffed at when it comes to an underdog, untested fighting IP. While the launch of the Dungeon Fighter Online spin-off is bearing down on us, there remains plenty of time for Nexon and Arc System Works to introduce us to more of its hard-hitting, (and compellingly hot), roster.
DNF Duel will launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28 — after you take a look at Swift Master, why not check out the previous character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, and Troubleshooter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mean, good songs are kind of the norm in this series
So far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is putting its best foot forward. We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called "A Life Sent On."
Shared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a "somber flute-based melody," which is played by "off-seers" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.
For now, I've listened this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times now (even when writing this!) and it's giving me extremely good vibes for how the game will turn out. Aesthetically it seems to be nailing everything it needs to, as that's arguably been one of the stronger points of the series from the start: outdoing other similar games on the same hardware.
Hopefully we get even more quality of life upgrades and a killer story. There's a lot to improve upon in the second core game mechanically.

Trailers, reveals, shadow-drops, speculation — it's E3 season, alright! We'll never be able to shake that term off, even if we think we should probably come up with a new name for it. And we know June is always rife with rumours and excitement, and while this one's a little bit bizarre, it certainly follows a very Nintendo pattern.
Bayonetta 3 was announced way back in 2017, and the only trailer we've seen since was shared last year (and it's above too, in case you've forgotten how brilliant it is!). And while Nintendo did reconfirm as part of its latest financial report that Bayonetta 3 is still coming in 2022, people are getting desperate for more details. Where's the news? The trailers? The glory! If Bayonetta 3 is coming out this year, then surely now is the time to show off the Umbra Witch's skills once again.

Publisher Humble Bundle announced that it has committed a further $1 million USD to its Black Game Developer Fund (BGDF), an ongoing initiative to provide funding and other financial support for projects homegrown projects conceived by Black game developers and Black-led studios.
Since its initial inception back in 2020, The Black Game Developer Fund has helped to finance over 30 independent developers with the conception, production, and publishing stages of their respective releases. This year's investment will be directed toward the following five in-development projects:
Code Blue Games — 6Degrees: A cyberpunkian action-adventure set within a dystopian universe.
GXGrainSon — Arcus Chroma: Dimensional Shift: A revamped edition of the colorful 2D fighting game.
Weathered Sweater — Unannounced: A new title helmed by Trinidadian-American dev Ryan Huggins.
Ritual Games — Unannounced: A new title from the young, retro-gaming-inspired studio.
Joseph Hooker — Unannounced: A new title promising "retro aesthetics, modern rendering," and a "compelling gameplay loop."

In addition, Humble Bundle has signed a new deal with one of the initiative's original seven beneficiaries, Adam Kareem, to publish their action platformer Protodroid DeLTA. The hi-tech, sci-fi, "solarpunk" adventure, is expected to launch on PC in early 2023 and is available for wishlisting over on the Humble Store right now.

With long-running rumours of a GoldenEye 007 re-release coming soon, we've once again been thinking about Rare's seminal N64 shooter, a landmark first-person shooter which would go on to influence the genre and larger console gaming trends for years following its 1997 release. It is, pretty inarguably, the best James Bond game ever made — certainly the most influential.

GoldenEye 007's Return Could Be Close

However, games that carry the name of the world's least secret agent have been many and varied, with winners like Everything or Nothing, the underrated World is Not Enough, and a bunch more appearing on Nintendo consoles. 007 might have been quiet for a while — since 2012's 007 Legends, in fact — but we count 19 James Bond games released for Nintendo platforms over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Project Moorcroft" is rolling out later this year
Just today, as part of a vague tease of what's to come on Sunday during Microsoft's "E3" 2022 conference, they've posted some plans for both the next few years and "the next 20 years." Perhaps most importantly in the near future, the company announced an enhanced Xbox demo program coming later this year.
Here's the recap, with some bullet points being more pertinent to some audiences than others:
Bringing the Xbox app to Samsung 2022 Smart TVs
Expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming to more countries
Bringing new gaming experiences to Microsoft Edge and Windows 11
Rolling out updates for Xbox Game Pass members
Introducing more options to express yourself with Xbox Design Lab
Several facets of this plan just involves plain old Microsoft corporate expansion: the type of thing that only really excites shareholders/execs. But the biggest point is arguably the bit about Xbox Game Pass, including a new Xbox demo program announced today called "Project Moorcroft."
No this isn't a misspelled code name for a game starring a Sherlock Holmes relative: it's a vague promise of "new curated demos of upcoming games." Microsoft says that it'll arrive "within the next year," and the start of the program will focus on "independent developers from around the world." Apparently it's not just offering consumer-side benefits, as developers can view metrics of "how their demos perform," and earn compensation.
Paying people to bring stuff to the Xbox platform is decidedly Microsoft. But I've generally been a fan of everything they're doing this generation from a macro-perspective, so hopefully this does actually encourage better relationships for indie studios, publishers, and fans alike. We'll find out more "within the next year," and possibly on Sunday during Microsoft's showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft revealed today that a new Xbox app for 2022 Samsung Smart TVs will let Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers stream their games. However, that’s not all the company had to reveal today. 
In a new Xbox Wire blog post, Microsoft discusses Project Moorcroft, which is seemingly its take on the PlayStation Plus Game Trials system launching with the revamped service on June 13. According to the blog post, the program will bring “the fun and discovery of playing new, curated demos of upcoming games to our Xbox Game Pass members,” and it will begin rolling out next year. It will start with “a focus on providing independent developers from around the world more opportunities to build excitement for their games.” 
Xbox says participating developers will be able to see how their demos perform, and the company will compensate them too, “enabling them to bring their creativity to Xbox and reach new audiences with Game Pass.” Xbox also says that later this year, “it’s our intent to roll out the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play, from the cloud, select games they already own or have purchased outside the Xbox Game Pass library.” 
Elsewhere in the blog post, Microsoft has revealed new colors for Xbox Design Lab. They include Soft Pink, Soft Orange, Soft Green, and Soft Purple. There are new Camo Top cases with matching side caps, too, including Mineral Camo, Arctic Camo, Forest Camo, Sandglow Camo, and Blaze Camo. Xbox Design Lab is launching in 11 new countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Slovakia, and Switzerland. Xbox Design Lab will come to Taiwan later this summer.

Nintendo Switch Sports is still the king of the Japanese charts this week. The sports simulation game racked up another 28,259 sales in the week of 30th May to 5th June. It's fast approaching 500,000!
But it faced some stiff competition from a brand new release this week. MAGES' visual novel, The Quintessential Quintuplets the Movie: Five Memories of My Time with You, charted on both Switch and PS4, with the Switch version selling 21,440 units, which doesn't put it far behind Switch Sports. The PS4 version sold just over 9,000, but it's an impressive debut for the Japan-exclusive game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. 
This wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. 
Forza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: 
“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”
Are you excited about the alleged crossover?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demo is out now, the full game is out on June 24
Following a vague Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo listing last week, Nintendo pulled the trigger yesterday, and made the whole thing available straight off the eShop. There's a few important things to note though that are worth pointing out specifically.
Progress from the Three Hopes demo can be carried over to the full game
This one was obvious to anyone who already played a similar demo from the Koei Tecmo/Nintendo partnership, but it's worth explaining regardless. Downloading and playing the demo will allow you to carry over progress to the full version once you've bought it.
The Three Hopes demo nets you 100 platinum points for My Nintendo rewards
Nintendo has started incentivizng game trials with platinum points, and Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is the next one in line for that offer. If you play it through July 31 (note this is even after the game is fully out) you can nab 100 platinum, which can be used for digital or physical rewards (plus shipping for the latter). As is typical with offers like these, you just need to download it, and fully boot the game up (it should pop after you reach the title screen). You can use those rewards to pick up some new Zelda: Breath of the Wild icons.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

The Switch has become home to some, shall we say, questionable games in the five-ish years since its release. The latest to make its way onto the eShop is truly baffling, however. It's a game that's so shameful in both its premise and brazen nods toward a certain Rockstar franchise that we're astonished it's an actual real game.

        <updated>2022-06-09T13:25:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony officially announced three TV shows last month – a God of War series at Amazon, a Gran Turismo show, and a Horizon series coming to Netflix – and these three joined the already-in-production Twisted Metal TV series. The latter has received plenty of updates, such as word that Anthony Mackie will star and Will Arnett will voice Sweet Tooth. Details about these other shows, though, have remained unknown. 
However, new details about Netflix’s Horizon show have reportedly leaked, including that it will be called Horizon 2074. This news comes from GamesBeat’s Jeff Grubb, as reported by Eurogamer. Grubb said Horizon 2074 will be “split between the timeline you see in the games and the timeline of where things begin to fall.” 


He also said the idea is that the series will not be “a reboot or remake or reimagining of the game’s storyline” but will instead “take place parallel and explain other elements that happen,” according to Eurogamer. 
If Grubb’s leaked details end up being true – mind you, this show sounds very early in production, so some things could change as well – then it sounds like we’ll be getting a lot of backstory and lore related to the fall of humanity. We might also learn how Earth gets to where it is at the start of Horizon Zero Dawn. Only time will tell for now. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Horizon Zero Dawn review and check out our thoughts on Horizon Forbidden West. After that, check out the first look at gameplay for PSVR 2’s Horizon: Call of the Mountain game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We first heard the news of Cyberpunk 2077's anime two years ago, months before the sci-fi RPG's official release. Today, a new and gory mini trailer revealed the flashy grittiness of the upcoming Netflix show.


The Maelstrom gang is displayed in the short clip (seen above). The criminal faction, known for its obsession with prosthetic enhancements, conducts a ransom deal with a group of unnamed protagonists. A woman is stowed away in a small, fridge-like contraption until she's quickly rescued. This is Night City, after all, so violence ensues. Limbs are hacked off and blown to bits in eye-popping fashion, which might be no surprise as the acclaimed Studio Trigger (Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, Promare) is responsible for the art direction and animation. We can't hear any dialogue as cacophonic guitar riffs add flavor to the bloody action. Even so, the shocking violence and heavy atmosphere are reminiscent of CD Projekt Red's vision. 
Not much is known about the anime, but the Netflix blurb in the YouTube video reads as follows:
"The series tells a standalone, 10-episode story about a street kid trying to survive in Night City – a technology and body modification-obsessed city of the future. Having everything to lose, he stays alive by becoming an edgerunner – a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk." 
The show will exist in the same universe as the game, so come September, we might even get to see or hear about V's exploits!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inside ActivisionBlizzard there are two wolves. Possibly dire wolves, or some other species of fantastical monster with surplus vowels in the name. Dreade Froste Beaste Wolfe. Anyway, one of them is made of decent people, developers who are fighting for better working conditions and making the best games they can under the circumstances. The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it's actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). 
Diablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it's all right to play! However, I don't know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it's a bad decision and we've already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.

Everyone expected Nintendo Switch Sports to sell well. And, after it snuck in at fourth in last month's European charts despite only being out for a few days, it's perhaps unsurprising that the family and online-oriented sports game is the number one selling game for the month of May across Europe.
That's mightily impressive given that Nintendo doesn't share digital sales and that this is based only on the physical. However, it's not exactly had stiff competition in what has been a quiet month. No new game releases have charted in the European top 20. Looking ahead to this month, we expect that will probably change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite released last November after a year-long delay from its initial 2020 release. Still, it did not launch with a few highly anticipated features like campaign co-op, online and split-screen, and Forge. 
In February, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten announced that the team was delaying an update regarding those modes planned for January. That update finally arrived in March, with the unfortunate news that campaign co-op and Forge had been pushed back to an unspecified date. Now, we have a new update regarding co-op: Halo Insiders can participate in a campaign network co-op flight in July. 
“With Halo Infinite campaign network co-op arriving later this year, we’re planning to flight it to Halo Insiders in July,” a tweet from the Halo Twitter account reads. “Register and make sure your Halo Insider profile is up to date for a chance to participate.”

June 7, 2022
You can do that here. As for what to expect, it sounds like this will be a Halo Infinite campaign network co-op beta meaning you’ll be able to try online co-op, (not to be confused with split-screen). If you’re interested, be sure to update your Halo Insider details or sign up if you’ve never done that before.

Music has always been an important part of fighting games — from setting the tone, to providing the backbeat of the fight, to being dynamically controlled by the in-game action, perhaps best realized in the excellent 2012 fighter, Killer Instinct. And so, the reveal of a new fighting title's theme song is something of a big deal, as it often reflects the entire vibe and aesthetic that will form the core of the game's mood.
Capcom has partnered with legendary music mag Rolling Stone to debut the full version of the official theme song to Street Fighter 6. "Not On The Sidelines", performed by artists Rocco808 and Randy Marx, is an aggressive hip-hop track that reflects not only Street Fighter 6's "back to the streets" approach to the franchise, but also emphasizes competition and the desire to overcome all obstacles to become the best on the block, reminiscent of the halcyon days of arcade centers and queues of quarters.
Of course, it's music, and as such it Will Not be For Everyone. Y'all know how old yer boy is — back in my day musicians didn't have numbers in their names... Maybe 808 State... oh, and Jurassic 5... oh, and Level 42... and Haircut 100. But I digress. You can check out Not On The Sidelines right now over on the official Rolling Stone page. (The video was also unofficially re-upped to YouTube by user Sakura buff when.) The track is not yet available for purchase.
Street Fighter 6 launches 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can also check out our thoughts on its new protagonists, and read all about the supposed roster leak right here.

Can anyone think of any video game soundtrack that's been debated over more that Sonic the Hedgehog 3's? The King of Pop — Michael Jackson's — involvement has long been debated, with other musicians seemingly confirming that he did indeed help with the game's music in an interview back in 2016. But this has still been contested by other SEGA employees.
One of those interviewees — Brad Buxer, a keyboardist who worked closely with Michael Jackson in the '90s — recently sat down with the Abbey Road Institute Paris to talk about his involvement in the music industry, including how he got into the industry, his time in the new wave band The Jetzons, and how he met and got to work with MJ.

Turner has already proved his hand at creating games, directing the 3DS rhythm-based platformer HarmoKnight back in 2012, and now he and developer @onebitbeyond (who was behind cute action RPG The Swords of Ditto) are joining forces to form All Possible Futures. And, in Turner-style, there's some adorable accompanying art to promote the studio, along with a tease of a game announcement.

It's being developed by Stunlock Studios, the folks behind arena-brawler Battlerite that lifts the fights from MOBAs like Dota 2 or League Of Legends and cuts away all the tedious build-up. So quite the departure then? Yes and no. V Rising strikes out as its own thing, but Stunlock's back catalogue definitely bleeds into its combat and exploration and easygoing attitude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Studio Trigger series launches this fall
Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the brand new anime series set within the neon nightmare universe of CD Projekt RED RPG Cyberpunk 2077. The new video gives us our first look at the animated show in action, following on from its initial announcement back in 2020.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4ztgjvfU60
The minute-plus teaser chooses to go with an "assault on the senses" vibe, foregoing plot details or character introductions for wild visuals, atmospheric vistas, and pulse-pounding music. The anime instinctively carries the vibe of its production team, Studio Trigger, which is known for its acclaimed work on shows such as Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Star Wars: Visions. In this trailer, we get a lil' of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners violence, a lil' of its romance, a lil' of its crazy tech, and, of course, the obligatory Akira-esque bike chase.
It's a pretty good debut, but we'll have to wait for the first episode to really get a taste of the action.
The rough narrative outline for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners concerns the escapades of a young street punk who, with nothing left to lose, falls in with a band of digital mercenaries-for-hire, known in the universe as "Edgerunners". The 10-episode anime will follow the protagonist and their new comrades as they pick their way through the oppressive, opulent, and highly hazardous neon nightmare that is Night City.
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners will launch exclusively on Netflix this September.

So why wouldn't Nintendo want to take advantage of that and promote the music!
This morning, Nintendo UK shared what has become one of the most iconic songs already from the upcoming game.

In the course of playing Metal Max Xeno Reborn, I reached the point where I could make a move on a female party member. I did so, and the game told me that the two protagonists lived happily ever after while the rest of humanity died. It then rolled credits and kicked me to the main menu. Cool.
I later got the opportunity to make a move on one of the male party members. I was curious, so I did so and got the same result. And that’s how my rampant bisexuality ended the world.
Like many in the West, I had never experienced a game from the long-running Metal Max series before. While the series has been around since 1991 on the Famicom, it has only rarely reached our shores: Metal Saga in 2006 for PS2 and Metal Max Xeno in 2018 for PS4 and Vita.

This week sees the arrival of Mario Strikers: Battle League on the Nintendo Switch. So far, we've seen the initial impressions, a round-up of reviews, and now we've got Digital Foundry's technical analysis. So, how does the game hold up on the Switch?
Jumping straight into it - Battle League runs at a full 1080p in the docked mode - with a "surprisingly sharp and clean" display, while the portable mode is locked at 720p.

It's like I'm really there
One of the things I love about games is how much they lean into genre fiction. Games have never been afraid to lean hard into sci-fi, fantasy, westerns, apocalypse stories, and so on. This means we get a lot of stories that stand out with their unique characters, mechanics, and lore, but one of my favorite aspects of games has to be how settings take on a whole personality of their own. Rather than serving as a backdrop for the action, so many game settings take a front seat in the story, driving home its themes and moving the plot forward.
Perhaps my favorite example of great settings in games comes from the BioShock series. Cities like Rapture and…]]></summary>

Not to be confused with a certain high-profile Super Smash Bros. Brawl mod, Project M from NCSOFT is an upcoming Unreal Engine 5-developed, console-bound "interactive movie experience" with an eye-catching trailer. I can't say I'm exactly picturing a full-fledged game yet from this limited proof-of-concept, but the premise of a "man seeking vengeance" — combined with these high production values — speaks to me.

The footage is heavy on the "is revenge ever really worth it" theme? and shows a few action sequences that would look at home in one of Supermassive's cinematic horror adventures like The Quarry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You could help test the long-awaited online campaign co-op
Halo fans who have been waiting for Infinite to get some campaign co-op might not have to wait much longer. 343 Industries announced its going to test out online Halo Infinite campaign co-op in July.
The test flight will be for Halo insiders, 343's program for experimenting and getting feedback on Halo games. These public flights offer a chance to test things out, stress them a bit, and provide some feedback to the team.
If you're hoping to get some network co-op in, you're able to sign up for the program here on the Halo Waypoint.
https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1534233991972257792
Keep in mind, this is just the insider test that's rolling out in July. 343 Industries is still targeting later this year for the official launch of campaign co-op. And note that that's network campaign co-op, too, so no split-screen just yet.
Carrying on the fight
Campaign co-op has been an elusive addition for Halo Infinite. First it slipped the launch window, then was pushed into 2022, and now it seems to be aiming for an August launch.
The Forge, Halo's extensive custom map and content creation tool, has also been pushed back a few times as well. At least with test flighting on the way for co-op, odds seem good that 343 Industries is closing in on a launch.
That might help 343 set a better tone for Halo Infinite moving forward too. The post-launch rollout has had some bumps, with the team acknowledging a "bumpy start" to Halo Infinite Season 2 last month.
Campaign co-op and the Halo series are synonymous for me, so it's safe to say that the full launch of online campaign co-op would definitely get me to boot Infinite back up. The latest Halo has been something I enjoy going back to every couple of months for a few quick matches of Team Slayer and Big Team Battle, but I'd love to see 343 finally roll out the heavy hitters it's been working on.

The Logitech G915 Lightspeed TKL is an ultra-slim, low profile mechanical keyboard that feels like the best laptop keyboard you've ever used. Lightspeed means Logitech's reliable 2.4GHz wireless, while 'TKL' stands for tenkeyless, a compact design that ditches the numpad for superior ergonomics and longer battery life. 
Altogether, it's a beautifully-designed mechanical keyboard, with a high price point being the only strike against it - and despite that, the full-size G915 has been our 'best wireless keyboard' recommendation for three years running. Today though, the G915 Lightspeed TKL is down to £109 after a £90 discount, making it an excellent time to upgrade your setup with a swanky new keyboard.

Activision is unveiling more details about its next Call of Duty today. Amid the Modern Warfare II news, there were also some new details about the upcoming Warzone experience, dubbed Warzone 2.0. It'll be using new tech and gameplay, and that means some old stuff like player inventory will need to stay in the old Warzone.
Development on the new Warzone experience will take the game into the same engine behind Modern Warfare II itself. As part of this, Warzone 2.0 will feature new content and systems with "brand-new progression and inventories."

Big (tiny) news! One of our favourite indie games on the horizon just got a new trailer and a bunch of new screenshots, and we've got the exclusive! Misc. A Tiny Tale is a beautiful little gem of a game that was confirmed for Switch last year, and features two tiny robots, Buddy and Bagboy, on an adventure to collect cogs and help out other tiny characters you meet along the way.
You can probably tell just from the way it looks, but developer Tinyware Games has been heavily influenced by Pikmin, Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, and of course, cult classic Chibi-Robo, creating a 3D platformer that's story-driven and character-led, just like the good ol' days.

Now with the October 28 release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (not to be confused with the 2009 game with the same name), Activision is looking to overhaul the series by adding a whole host of new features to go along with the reboot, as reported by Polygon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[John Smith, 1882?
Focus Entertainment has announced an official release date for its gory, gothic shooter Evil West. This grisly and alternate take on undead life in the American Frontier will hit PC and console platforms September 20.
Developed by studio Flying Wild Hog, who sure know their way around an exploding head or three, Evil West sees players don the hat and poncho of a lone gunslinger, one of the last remaining members of a clandestine monster-hunting society. As a terrifying and bloodthirsty battalion of vampires, ghoulies, and legions of the undead emerges to lay waste to the Old West, it is up to our hero to lay down a law that goes way beyond a sheriff's badge, and put these decaying varmints back in the ground. Permanently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O35NOsTIoE
One or two players can saddle up for a hyper-violent campaign that will follow our outlaws as they forge a path through America's formative towns, cities, and wildlands, facing off against an army of ungodly creatures and offering all a date with oblivion. In typical Flying Wild Hog fashion, Evil West is loaded for bear with a huge arsenal of explosive, anachronistic weaponry, while players will also earn perks and upgrades to help turn the tide of battle in their favor.
It's a really cool setup, and I'm liking what I'm seeing in both the chaotic, cathartic gameplay and the atmospheric old-west-horror cutscenes. Evil West already looks to be one of those titles that might not be making a huge impact on the radars of the gaming community, but will prove to be one of the year's slickest and most compelling shooter experiences.
Evil West launches September 20 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Atlus is gearing up for the launch of its kinetic and stylish-looking sequel Soul Hackers 2, which is coming to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms this summer — and for those of you hardened hacker-heads, the publisher has also revealed a cool, (and somewhat pricey), collector's edition.
The Soul Hackers 2 Collector's Edition, which will be made available to western audiences, includes a physical copy of the game on the platform of your choice, along with several fun additions including an exclusive SteelBook case, a digital soundtrack on a themed USB stick, art cards, a pin badge set, and a Shark key chain, the centerpieces of this edition are a three-inch figurine of the series iconic mascot Ai-Ho, and a cute plushie of Mimi. The set will retail for $199.99 USD.
If you're interested in bagging this special edition, then you should mark your calendars for Friday, June 10 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET, for this is when Atlus will open pre-orders over on the official Shop Atlus store. The Collector's Edition is an online store exclusive and Atlus suggests that quantities for each platform are limited, so set your watch and be online when the pre-orders go live to ensure that you get your name down. While I think the pricing is pretty steep, I have to admit that Mimi plush is very cute.
Soul Hackers 2 launches August 26 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

So far what we've seen of Xenoblade Chronicles 3's locations look on point, and this week Nintendo is showing off more of the world of Aionios.
Shared by way of Nintendo's YouTube account (and Twitter), at least one zone has the classic Xenoblade look and feel of a lush water-filled environment (similar to Gaur Plain), and "Aionios" itself is most definitely appropriate nomenclature for a Xenoblade universe. As a reminder, Nintendo describes Aionios as "the rich world where you’ll begin your journey to end the cycle of violence between two opposing nations in Xenoblade Chronicles 3." Those two nations are Agnus and Keves. Through the clip below, we're able to get a glimpse at some of the verticality of exploration, some teases into a few structures that will likely have story ramifications, and of course, several enemy designs.
For me, it's hard for the team to really top Satorl Marsh from the first game. It's such a gorgeous area and it's the first thing I think of when I hear the phrase "Xenoblade Chronicles." Walking through it was a joy in the original and made me recall some of the best zones from '90s JRPGs, and going back through it in the Switch edition was a treat.

Donkey Kong has been a mainstay in the Mario series for an extremely long time. The name was first given to the ape who wreaked havoc in the original Donkey Kong arcade game (who we now know to be Cranky Kong), but the Donkey Kong we now know and love is the son of Donkey Kong Jr.
This dapper tie-wearing ape has been around since Rareware's Donkey Kong Country, and he's been fighting Kremlings, guarding bananas, and enjoying some sports with his grandfather's rival every once in a while ever since. But it sounds like DK's family also enjoyed a spot of travelling.

It's not often that I get to talk about Shadow the Hedgehog, so I'll definitely take this opportunity and run with it.
Like Waluigi (albeit less lovingly so), Shadow is often seen as an oddity of the universe he's in, especially given his insane backstory and penchant for using guns. When juxtaposed to Sonic and most of his "friends," he sticks out like a sore thumb. His polarizing reaction really doesn't need an introduction.
But like all black sheep, he has a legion of fans, and his edgelord nature has been used to great effect in some Sonic media. One of my favorite semi-recent takes was Shadow showing up in the otherwise goofy Sonic Boom as a serious character, only to have Robotnik refer to him as a "fan favorite" and talk about how much p…]]></summary>

Bend Studio, the Sony subsidiary behind survival horror wilderness title Days Gone, announced that it has started development on a brand new project — one that it hopes will advance the open-world adventure, excitement, and engagement of its aforementioned monster-bashing biker epic.
"We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you," said community manager Kevin McAllister in comments to PlayStation Blog. "We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right."
The comments come almost a year to the day that Bend Studio announced it would venture into new IP territory for its next project, news that came as something of a consolation prize to the controversial story that a Days Gone sequel was canned by Sony, despite the team feeling very passionate toward the idea of creating one. As I said at the time, you sometimes have to "do the thing to do the thing", and if Bend delivers a major hit for Sony with this new project, then perhaps the parent company will see to making Days Gone 2 a reality.
In related news, Bend Studio also revealed its new branding, complete with a snazzy new logo. The company has opened up numerous job listings for a wide variety of designers, coders, artists, and animators. You can check out the vacancies over on the official Bend Studio website.

Where were you when Infinity Ward conquered the console shooter scene with Call of Duty 4 and its equally revolutionary sequel, Modern Warfare 2? Operatives everywhere toured Chernobyl's dilapidated theme park in nothing but a ghillie suit, stumbled through the residual radioactive smog of a detonated nuclear warhead, stormed a Kazakhstan stronghold under intense blizzard cover, and saved the world with a single, well-aimed throwing knife.

We've been suspecting this for the last few weeks, and it seems like we were right! The Ashen Wolves will be joining the other three houses in the upcoming Musou game Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes.
To celebrate the release of a demo, which dropped today, Nintendo shared another new trailer titled 'Awakened Rivals', which shows us the return of Tea Time, some of your character — Shez's — moves, and the returning DLC house from Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Unlike the other three houses, the Ashen Wolves won't have their own route, but all four members — Yuri, Balthus, Constance, and Hapi — will be back and playable with their own preferred class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The animated tease is the most interesting part so far
So the unveiling of Sonic Frontiers gameplay didn't really go as planned for Sega, but they did tease an interesting departure from the open world formula: animated story sequences. Thanks to a new Sonic Central stream, we got a small tease of Sonic Frontiers story details.
There's two teases afoot, actually, both in the same day. One comes from the latest IGN video, which provides a snippet of the story:
"After flying into a wormhole with Tails and Amy, Sonic finds himself separated from his friends and all alone on an isolated island, with nothing but an AI voice guiding him to collect the Chaos Emeralds."

So the obvious takeaways here are that Tails and Amy are a part of Frontiers, and that we possibly won't get an overload of "friends." Remember the tenuous original story tidbit shared by Sega back during the announcement, too, which was subsequently removed from Polygon's report due to Sega deeming it "incorrect:"
"In Sonic Frontiers, Sonic’s long-time nemesis Dr. Eggman discovers an ancient technology on the Starfall Islands and installs his AI program SAGE to hack in and take over. But there is more to this technology than he realizes, and unintended consequences immediately come to bear. Sonic must race against time to discover the truth, save his friends, and maybe even save himself at the same time."

The second recent tease comes via a short clip in the Sonic Central stream that's literally just a few seconds, we see Knuckles at the top of the stairs seemingly guarding an emerald [probably the master]. The full short will be shared "later this year, prior to the release of Sonic Frontiers." Remember, this story will be penned by Sonic comic writer Ian Flynn, and right now, it's the most intriguing part of this new entry.

Capcom's second Arcade Stadium collection was announced in April, and we've been eagerly waiting to find out what games will be included in the package.
However, it looks like we might not need to wait! Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium's 32 game line-up has potentially been leaked through the Microsoft Store, as reported by our friends at Push Square, and the leak has revealed that there's a fair bit of crossover with previous Capcom collections, including the first Capcom Arcade Stadium and the currently unreleased Capcom Fighting Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No more. No less.
After Bioware's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic wowed audiences with its in-depth storytelling and RPG mechanics in 2003, publisher LucasArts decided that a sequel would have to be made as soon as possible. Much akin to how Majora’s Mask came out barely a year after Ocarina of Time changed the game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II was fired out as soon as developer Obsidian Entertainment could possibly make it and released a little less than a year and a half after its predecessor. Considering that an entirely new development team of just seven people took over for this entry while still meeting that narrow deadline, it’s truly a miracle that the final product turned out as good as it did. As a standalone that was evidently rushed to market, KOTOR II may overall feel weaker than its predecessor, but it also does a fantastic job of maintaining the high standards previously set in storytelling and gameplay.
Before we get too into the weeds, we think it bears mentioning that this re-release on modern platforms brings with it the opportunity to finally play the game KOTOR II was originally envisioned as before the demands of the deadline necessitated that the dev team cut content. A free post-launch patch — The Sith Lord Restored Content DLC — is coming which will bring this missing content back by reworking the entire final act of the game with a whole new level, hundreds of bug fixes, adjusted cutscenes, new enemy encounters, and expanded dialogue with important characters. Those of you who have played this in the past on PC may already be familiar with the content (which comes courtesy of a fan-developed mod) but suffice to say this is an exciting new chapter for a game viewed by many as not living up to its full potential in its original form. If you're after the 'complete' KOTOR II package, this re-release will offer that — if not at launch.

Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It's an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.
"About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it," says producer Swann Martin-Raget. "We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director's cats called Murtaugh. He's not an exact copy, but he's the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he's a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we've adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us."

Nintendo has been struggling to provide Switch Online perks to users for some time, but one such perk is occasional game trials: sparing preview versions of full games during certain windows. The next one will be a Stardew Valley Switch Online trial, limited to Australia, Europe, and Japan currently.
With my European and Japanese Switch accounts (they're helpful for reporting!), I was able to see the notification in the "news" sections at the bottom of the Switch UI. The trial will run from June 13 (12:00 JST) through June 19 (17:59 JST). Australia even has an eShop page up for it.
If you somehow haven't played Stardew Valley yet, now is the time, provided you're able to take part in the trial. It's tough to really put into words how magical this game is that hasn't already been said, but suffice to say a few hours with it should give you a clue as to whether or not you're going to be spending another 100 hours with it.
Also note that you should be able to take advantage of the extra My Nintendo mission points once the trial is live. As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward.

Valve has announced the return of its annual summer tradition, the Steam Next Fest, which will once again offer up a huge selection of trials and demos pulled from a wide variety of incoming indie titles.
From Monday, June 13, Steam users will be able to download and check out "hundreds" of demos free of charge. Valve did not release a full list of the available titles, but a short trailer — which you can check out below — references a huge variety of spunky young developers and publishers, all of whom are no doubt hoping that you will find a few minutes to check out their wares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnu-nh4NI0Y
According to the above video's description, the Steam Next Fest trailer spotlights (deep breath) Arksync, BROK the InvestiGator, Cult of the Lamb, Daydream Forgotten Sorrow, Exophobia, Foretales, Gestalt Steam Cinder, Glimmer in Mirror, Harmony's Odyssey, King of the Hat, LEGO Bricktales, Misc. A Tiny Tale, Nine Sols, Eyes in the Dark, Fays Factory, and Ghost Song. Of course, these titles make up just a sliver of the demos that will be spotlit during the event.
Steam Next Fest will end on Monday, June 20, so you have a full seven days to check out as many demos as you choose. As this "non-E3" week is already a pretty busy one in regard to live streams, news, and reveals, it might be hard to find space for "hundreds" of releases, but, hopefully, all interested parties will find at least a few new games to add to your Steam wishlist.

That’s because Nintendo announced Three Hopes has a demo available to download now. You can play up to Chapter 4 in each of the game’s three routes: The Edelgard-led “Scarlet Blaze” Empire route, the Dimitri-led “Azure Gleam” Kingdom route, and the Claude-led “Golden Wildfire” Alliance route. What’s more, your progress carries over to the full game once purchased. 
Nintendo also released a new Awakened Rivals trailer to coincide with today’s news, and it features new looks at gameplay, in-game systems and mechanics, playable characters, and much more. Check it out for yourself below: 


“Step into the shoes of Shez as you join Fire Emblem: Three Houses characters, such as the Ashen Wolves, in epic, real-time battles across Fódlan,” the trailer’s description reads. “The house you choose will bring you through one of three compelling stories set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses universe, each with a different outcome.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Should be live any day now
Although it isn't fully live currently, a Fire Emblem: Three Hopes demo popped up on the Nintendo store recently. While it currently errors out if you try and download/access it, the listing clearly points to a demo reveal that will likely happen in the near future, so keep an eye out for it: especially if you pre-ordered already.
Typically, Warriors demos involve several early stages, potential access to the world map, and the ability to free play until a certain point in the game. At that point, you should be able to carry over progress into the full version. So for fans, it should be a meaty dive into what Three Hopes has to offer, and provide a glimpse into the new take on the storyline, as well as any potential gameplay adjustments.
Of course, it'll also be an important showcase for something that's deeply impacted Warriors games, especially on Switch: performance. While some can live with framerate issues, others can't, and Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo will need to put its best foot forward if it wants to sell more people on the game leading up to launch. Performance hasn't stopped Omega Force and company before, though!
Again, when it goes live, you'll find it here, or on the eShop proper.
[Update: Nintendo has confirmed that the Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo is live as of 10:00AM ET June 8, 2022! You can play through the game's first three chapters, and can carry over progress when it launches. Split-screen two-player co-op is confirmed by Nintendo.]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I think [you] can enjoy the story 100 times more"
Should you play Bayonetta 1 and 2 before 3? Well, you don't have to! But producer Hideki Kamiya thinks you should.
We've been through this before in the past. As recently as four months ago, Kamiya noted that folks who played the original two games would get more out of the threequel, which is still slated for later this year. Now he's taken to Twitter this week to reiterate that this is still his stance.
Here's what he says, roughly translated:
"Somehow I wanted to say this again, but if you are thinking of playing Bayonetta 3, I definitely want you to play Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta 2 by now ... I think that person can enjoy the story 100 times more."

Kamiya notes that with the second game, he "intentionally created a story where you can play it in any order" and not be too lost. But with Bayonetta 3, he worked on the story in such a way that he assumes enough people are aware of the series to have played it, and wanted to make the world-building elements "more profound" with that background informing the audience. He goes on to share this "introductory video" of the first two games (which is in Japanese).
Naturally, if Bayonetta 3 is anything like its predecessors, it'll stand on its own two feet as an action game, even if you skip the entire story. But I really want to see what the third game has up its sleeve now that we have a full-on universe on our hands at this point.
Kamiya answers the question: "Should you play Bayonetta 1 and 2 before 3?"

Deliver Us Mars is coming on September 27. The space-faring adventure stars Kathy Johanson, an astronaut who enlists on a mission to Mars to locate stolen colonization vessels in search of a way to restore a dying Earth. She’s also chasing a mysterious signal that may be linked to her long-lost father. 


Like the first game, players will split time between solving environmental puzzles as well as platforming. The video shows Kathy scaling cliffs and other structures with her climbing ax, and the game also features scuba diving and zero gravity exploration. In addition to trekking across Mars’ dusty terrain, players will explore icy landscapes as well as interiors of ruined vessels and abandoned colonies. 
Deliver Us Mars will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC for $29.99. Publisher Frontier says to expect more information on the game at the PC Gaming Show on June 12.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a teaser trailer last year, DC and Warner Bros. Pictures have finally released an official trailer for its Black Adam movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.
Featuring arguably one of the brightest color palettes in all of the DCEU, this trailer provides some backstory to the anti-hero that is Black Adam before showcasing the strength of this character. And that strength is enough to seemingly rival Superman as Black Adam doesn’t so much as break a sweat when up against baddies, missiles, crowbars, and more. Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this trailer explains how Black Adam came to be. Nearly 5000 years ago, some bad people enslaved the man who would become Black Adam. Those same people then killed him, but somehow, his son sacrificed his life to help his father become Black Adam – an ancient god bestowed with mighty powers. However, just as quickly as he gained those powers, he was imprisoned. The trailer reveals that in the modern-day, he is somehow freed from the tomb and ready to “unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.” 
That unique form of justice will likely put him up against or on the paths of Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, Sarah Shahi’s Adrianna, Marwan Kenzari’s Ishmael, Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone, Bodhi Sabongui’s Amon, and Pierce Brosnan’s Dr. Fate. The director of Jungle Cruise, which also starred Johnson, Jaume Collet-Serra, is the director behind Black Adam. 
DC’s Black Adam hits theaters internationally on Oct. 19. It hits U.S. theaters two days later, on Oct. 21. For more, watch this teaser trailer from last year.

Whenever a Nintendo sports game comes out, I perk up. No, they're not all winners. But in the modern era of "solved design" (I'm using quotes liberally here) and roster-update-centric sports games, and the extreme homogenization of the genre, a silly soccer game with Mario characters in it is going to at least spark some interest on my end. Mario Strikers: Battle League ended up delivering, but there's a proviso. Make sure you have some people to play with, or be open to going online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West, not to be confused with Weird West from earlier this year, finally has a release date and it’s just a few months away. 
More specifically, Flying Wild Hog and publisher Focus Entertainment will release Evil West on Sept. 20. This news comes by way of a fancy new release date reveal trailer that you can watch below. It’s worth watching, too, because it looks great, complete with plenty of turn-of-the-century action, gore, and western antics. Oh, and monstrous vampires – can’t forget about those. 


“Jump right into frantic, gory carnage in a vampire-infested Wild West as the trailer introduces gunslinger Rentier on his mission to eradicate the supernatural terror,” a press release reads. “As the star agent in his father’s undercover monster-hunting organization, his fight is also a personal war against the nightmarish leading figures in the vampire world. Take on Jesse’s role as the final line between humanity and the vampire threat, rise up to become a Wild West superhero and save the United States.” 
Evil West will feature third-person action gameplay with an arsenal of guns and other weapons. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. 

For more about Wild West, watch its premiere trailer for The Game Awards 2020 and then check out this gameplay trailer from last year’s Game Awards show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Going into my chat with Steve Piggott and Rasmus Löfström of Torn Banner Studios, I thought I had a reasonable grasp of the developer’s trajectory up to that point. After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.
It turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The not-so-Nice Guys
In a week expected to be jam-packed with rumors and leaks, the loudest whispers of the past 24 hours concern Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima and his studio, Kojima Productions — according to the word around town, the studio is preparing to reveal a brand new horror title, going by the name of "Overdose."
The rumor was sparked by professional spoiler Tom Henderson, who has an uncanny knack for being very right in these matters. Writing on Try Hard Guides, Henderson claims to have already seen the first teaser trailer for Overdose, which sees a young woman — played by Margaret Qualley of Death Stranding, The Nice Guys, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood — picking her way through a creepy corridor by torchlight.
While this remains a mere rumor at present, Henderson's word has been proven correct on numerous occasions. In fact, (as noted by VGC) Henderson has gone on to claim that Kojima Productions has directly requested the removal of his words, in a tweet that has itself been removed. If Kojima and pals are preparing to reveal Overdose, then one would surmise that we can see it during this season's gaming news digest — perhaps during Thursday's Summer Game Fest, hosted by Kojima's speed-dial buddy Geoff Keighley.
Either way, it's exciting news, people have been linking Hideo Kojima to horror for many years, (lest we forget P.T.), and he has already proven he knows his way around a creepy character or two in the Metal Gear and Death Stranding titles. If Overdose exists, then it could prove to be the realization of the scary, Silent Hill-type adventure that has eluded the studio thus far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meet Apollo, the god of music
Hades is one of my favorite games of all time. It was my go-to game at the start of the pandemic, and after all was said and done I think I put close to 400 hours into that bad boy. I have played and replayed Hades to death, so anything new to help switch it up is a welcome change. Enter Apollo — the Greek god of music who was left off of the game's original lineup, but has since been added to the game by way of a mod thanks to AlexKage's project, OlympusExtra, which was originally spotted by ResetEra.
The mod adds Apollo to the game as if he were just like any of the other gods, including Boons (solo and duo), a Keepsake, a Wrath (you know, the environmental attack the gods spring on you when you're in a two-Boon chamber), and of course, plenty of dialogue. An artist named Reikiix did Apollo's portrait, which honestly looks so good you can't tell that it wasn't part of the base game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbeHCKiDB7M
Apollo's specialty is a blinding effect, which makes enemies more likely to miss their attacks. I can imagine that would go really well with Aphrodite or Athena's Boons if you want to go for a low-damage or even no-hit run. There are already some videos out there of modders playing with the Apollo mod, so those might be worth checking out if you want to see what he can do to help Zagreus escape the Underworld.
OlympusExtra is still in its early stages — not only will Apollo's inclusion of the game be more built out in the future with some more voice lines and duo Boons on the way, but other gods will also be added to the mix, including Hera, Hestia, and Hephaestus. Hades has fostered a huge cult following since its release in 2020, and it's great to see the modding community getting in on the action.

Newegg dropped their price on the EVGA Supernova 1000 G6 PSU to $140, and Amazon followed suit soon after. That's $50 below the usual price of $190, and a historic low for this model.
If you've got a high-end system - or you're planning to pick up a power-hungry next-gen graphics card when they launch later this year - then this is an awesome upgrade.

        <updated>2022-06-07T20:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a few PlayStation studios that we haven't heard much from in a while, one of which is the Days Gone developers Bend Studio. That changes today with a blog post detailing the history of Bend Studio and giving a tiny hint at what the team is up to with its next project.
The post details the games Bend had developed in its nearly 30-year history, from the first days of the studio when it was known as Blank, Berlyn and Co., through the time it was known as Eidetic when it developed Bubsy 3D, the Syphon Filter series, and beyond. There's a lot of great history about the studio packed in there alongside concept art and more. But, what comes next for Bend Studio is a break from any series or franchise it's worked on or created before. 
"We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you. We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right," writes Kevin McAllister from Bend Studio.
This is the second time Bend has mentioned its new project, with the first word coming from a tweet last year. While the next game from the studio won't be Days Gone 2, nor a return to Syphon Filter, it at least looks to be learning and building from those prior works. Additionally, whether this new IP will be part of Sony's new initiative to develop more live service games remains to be seen.
Bend Studio also took the opportunity to debut a new logo in the blog post, which you can see above. The logo treatment is a nice change in design from the previous iterations since it's now modular and can be fitted into different aesthetics for various occasions.

But with clever implementation of said metal music, Metal Hellsinger looks to transcend the spiritual successor label to become something else entirely.
By combining that fast-paced, frenetic first-person shooting action with rhythm-based mechanics that reward you for shooting in sync with the music, Metal Hellsinger delivers a wholly unique experience. While the gameplay conventions help separate the game from the pack, it's perhaps the original soundtrack that is most eye-catching.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and developer Mediatonic have announced a special collaboration for the popular game-show-style battle-royale game, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout. The collaboration brings costumes featuring the Blue Blur and his closest friends into the zany multiplayer experience.
Beginning in August, Fall Guys players can take the form of Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails during this new Sonic collaboration. For those unfamiliar with Fall Guys, this is far from the only collaboration the game has ever done, nor is this the first collaboration with the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. The initial appearance of the Blue Blur in Fall Guys came in 2020, but this new collaboration expands the offerings.
Starting June 21, Fall Guys not only comes to new platforms like Xbox and Switch, but it also goes free-to-play across all platforms. Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout originally launched in August 2020 and quickly became one of the most-played multiplayer games.

The pack is appropriately titled “Stand Back” because it’s headlined by The Hurricane. The emerald green superhero is joined by former Diva Stacey Keibler, NXT UK’s A-Kid, and former NXT Tag Team Champion Wes Lee. 


Like past DLC wrestlers, each new face comes with MyFaction EVO cards, including a Booker T and Sapphire Seth Rollins. The Stand Back pack costs $9.99 on its own and is part of the $39.99 Season Pass (included in the Deluxe and nWo 4-Life editions).

Originally revealed to a booing crowd as a mobile-only, MMO-styled take on the APRG series, its later-announced Windows release has revealed the full extent of a F2P monetisation system that ties immensely powerful Legendary Gem upgrades to costly loot boxes. Not a great look, especially coming from a company facing multiple lawsuits, staff walkouts and sexual harassment allegations.


Strictly speaking, the PC version of Diablo Immortal is in open beta, with only the mobile version launching as the finished article. The good news is that this leaves more room for the technical issues and oversights I’ve encountered to be fixed; the bad news is that they exist in the first place, and range from absent PC settings staples to repeating performance hiccups.

With its Studio Ghibli-esque styling, imaginative character designs and amazing music made by the legend that is Joe Hisaishi, its world is a true joy to immerse yourself in. It’s why I’m ultimately so disappointed by Cross Worlds. Netmarble has taken this pure, effervescent fantasy dream land and pushed it off the monkeybars into a steaming pile of gacha mechanics and crypto currencies.
To be fair, it’s not all bad. Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad. There’s a wonderful glimpse of something amazing that just never materialises as the mirk of mobile-based gameplay is just too thick to get through.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/07/battlefield-2042-update-10-includes-hundreds-of-changes-and-fixes-ahead-of-season-1"/>
        <updated>2022-06-07T11:56:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A massive 1.0 update for Battlefield 2042 is out now on all platforms, and it brings hundreds of changes, bug fixes, and quality of life improvements to the online shooter ahead of its Season 1 launch. 
And speaking of Season 1: Zero Hour, DICE will reveal gameplay today at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET on its official Battlefield 2042 YouTube channel, as reported by VG247. There, you’ll see a glimpse of these changes and improvements and a look at what the first season of Battlefield 2042 looks like. As for the update, here’s what Dice has highlighted: 
Multiple improvements to soldier gameplay which will result in overall smoother animations and movement.
Weapons received updated netcode to improve bullet hit registration. We’ve also done a further balance pass which includes increased projectile speeds for DMR’s and LMG’s, and improved accuracy for Shotguns.
Multiple new XP events have been added, such as for killing an enemy who recently wounded or killed a squadmate, or when an enemy vehicle you recently damaged is destroyed by a teammate and the occupants are killed
The number of available in-world vehicles has been increased for Conquest which should make it easier to move across the map
Sundance’s Wingsuit has been adjusted to lower overall flight time, while making it easier to maneuver. To simplify their Specialty, the EMP Field Smart Explosive has been removed
Dice is scheduling the next update for early July, but it’s “a smaller update that brings further fixes and changes to the battlefield.” Head to Dice’s full patch notes list for the complete list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements. 
While waiting for today’s Season 1 debut, read Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review and read about how the next Battlefield has entered pre-production with “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. Check out Dice’s response to Battlefield 2042 map complaints and feedback afterward.

        <updated>2022-06-06T21:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madden NFL 23 is coming in August with some new tech set to change the game entirely on both sides of the ball. Our own Brian Shea recently went hands-on with the latest version of Madden and its game-changing feature FieldSense, which encompasses a variety of changes to gameplay and animations. You can check out a deep dive into everything FieldSense offers in the video above.
FieldSense, which is exclusive to the newest generation of consoles (PS5 and Xbox Series X/S), has a few different aspects that are covered in the video by senior game design director for Madden NFL 23, Connor Dougan. First is a set of new physics-informed animation as well as animation branching technology that brings a more realistic look to the action on the field. New gameplay techniques like 360 Cuts introduce more control for receivers and running backs, while Hit Everything is a feature that affects just about everything on the defensive side of the ball. For Quarterbacks, Skill Based Passing will let players fine-tune where they're throwing the ball for more precise passes that can be kept away from pass defenders. There are demonstrations of those new concepts and more in the almost five-minute breakdown.
Madden NFL 23 lands on August 19 this year with the man himself, John Madden, gracing the cover. While FieldSense is only available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, other versions of the game are also coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/06/plumbers-dont-wear-ties-definitive-edition-arrives-this-year"/>
        <updated>2022-06-06T21:23:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back at E3 2021, we learned that Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, one of the strangest FMV games of the ’90s, was getting remastered for modern consoles courtesy of Limited Run Games. Now we know that John, Jane, and Thresher will return later this year. 
The news comes by way of today's Limited Run Presents showcase. What the heck is Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, you ask? The 1993 game is best described as an interactive romantic comedy firmly aimed at adults, thanks to its mild nudity and sexual innuendo. Players guide a plumber named John, who tries to win the heart of a beautiful woman named Jane in an adventure laden with ridiculous hijinks. That includes dealing with an unreliable narrator and confronting a, shall we say, creepy boss. The gameplay involves making simple decisions in a choose-your-own-adventure format and watching live-action cutscenes. 
To editorialize a bit, Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties is absurd and pretty bad. However, as footage of the game found its way on YouTube over the years, the game has found new life as a cult favorite “so bad it’s good” oddity, not unlike Night Trap (which got a similar remaster a few years ago). Since Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties had a limited release on PC and the poor-selling 3DO console, not many folks have been able to play it themselves. 
The Definitive Edition polishes up the adventure with 4K visuals and adds features such as deleted scenes, a progress chart, and new video interviews with the cast. 
Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties: Definitive Edition launches later this year for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be available both digitally and in physical form, thanks to Limited Run Games. If you’re into FMV games, check out this deep-dive feature about the history of the genre.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has started a week-long celebration of its upcoming shows and movies coming to the streaming service, and on today's edition of Geeked Week, a new trailer premiered for the new Resident Evil series. Beware, the footage does contain violence, gore, and adult language.


Resident Evil takes place in two time periods, 2022 and 2036, following Jade Wesker (Ella Balinska) before and after the T-Virus is unleashed on the public, causing all kinds of monsters such as zombie people, zombie dogs, and the biggest monster of them all, pharmaceutical corporations. There's also a kaiju-sized caterpillar, and that's pretty cool too! The series also stars Lance Reddick as Albert Wesker, Tetiana Gaidar, and Connor Gosatti. 
Here's a brand new poster for Resident Evil featuring the Licker, an iconic creature that first premiered in Resident Evil 2:
You can start watching Resident Evil on Netflix beginning July 14.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve written one of these Letters From The Editor. Things have been… manic, to say the least. Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. 
What I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 made a big splash during its PlayStation State of Play showing last week, revealing two more fighters, some sort of exploration story mode, and more. While we await more details on some of those features, Capcom has divulged some info on Ryu's new look and the game's place in the Street Fighter timeline.
The game's official Twitter account shared a statement by director Takayuki Nakayama that confirms Street Fighter 6 takes place after the events of Street Fighter III. This places the game at the end of the series' timeline given that Street Fighter V is set before SF 3. 
As for Ryu's new look, Nakayama explains his Buddhist robe, also called a kasaya, showcases Ryu's newfound dignity despite the warrior feeling he's "not there yet." What that means is up to interpretation, but the attire does pair well with Ryu's dashing beard if nothing else. 
"Although Street Fighter 6 occurs after the Street Fighter III series, Ryu still feels that he's "not there yet" - though he seems to have gained some dignity. The way he wears the kasaya (Buddhist robe) is reminiscent of his master, Goken."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About nine months after its release, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is getting a big patch today, introducing two much-requested features that will hopefully make the brawler feel like a more well-rounded product. Developer Ludosity has announced it's finally adding character voices and items to the game today.
Alongside voice acting and items, here are the latest patch notes! pic.twitter.com/gfTHwtz4Tj
June 6, 2022
Paired with some substantial character balance adjustments and stage changes, Nick Brawl's fighters will now have voices, with many of the original actors for these characters reprising their roles. This includes what looks to be a big rework of Sandy, which you can see in the embedded tweet above. Here's the complete cast list as revealed by the Nick Brawl Twitter account: 
Jim Cummings: Shredder / CatDog (Cat)
Tom Kenny: Spongebob / CatDog (Dog)
Bill Fagerbakke: Patrick
Carolyn Lawrence: Sandy
Alex Cazares: Oblina
Jim Meskimen: Nigel Thornberry
Richard Horvitz: Zim
Vivian Vencer: Toph
Dustin Sardella: Aang
Janet Varney: Korra
Fred Tatasciore: Reptar
Bentley Griffin: Lincoln Loud
Jessica DiCicco: Lucy Loud
Franchesca Marie Smith: Helga
Townsend Coleman: Michelangelo
Cam Clarke: Leonardo
Abby Trott: April O'Neil
Frank Welker: Garfield
Billy West: Ren & Stimpy
David Kaye: Powdered Toast Man
David Kaufman: Danny Phantom
Janice Kawaye: Jenny
With the entire cast getting voiced, it's safe to assume upcoming characters Hugh Neutron and Rocko will receive the same treatment. As stated before, items are also joining the game, but there's almost no detail on what those items may be or what they do in battle. We'll just have to play to find out.
The new Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl patch hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC today, with the Switch update coming later. PlayStation Plus members can claim a free copy of Nick Brawl until the end of June as part of the PS+ monthly game offerings alongside God of War and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.]]></summary>

I'm now attuned to their look, their pacing, their good and bad points. So, it came as no surprise when I found myself testing out the closed alpha of yet another of their ilk: Ripout, an upcoming sci-fi horror FPS that's very Doom 3.
What's nice is that vidbud Liam joined me! Both because he's a fan of the FPS genre and to be present with a jar in hand, lest I crumbled into dust. Thankfully this didn't happen and we had a pretty swell time, I'd say. It's early days for the game but there's potential there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last weekend's Pokémon Go Fest delivered two days of catching fun, along with the debuts of Nihilego and Shaymin within the mobile game. Now, Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game are crossing over with events that will touch both games. For Pokémon Go, the event begins on June 16 and brings the chance to catch Wimpod and a new version of Pikachu wearing a TCG hat.
For the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the next expansion is themed around Pokémon Go, and will feature cards based on Team Mystic, Instinct, and Valor. We'll have to wait to see just how many of the cards are true crossovers, but no matter what, it's great seeing these two popular games work together.
For the mobile trainers out there, Wimpod is one of those Pokémon that requires 400 candies to evolve. When this number is hit, Wimpod evolves into Golisopod. The creature that looks a bit like a dead fish transforms into one of the coolest Godzilla-like beasts in all of Pokémon.
This event also sees Mewtwo returning to five-star raids. All Mewtwo caught from June 16 to June 23 will have the Shadow Ball charged attack. Those caught from June 23 to July 1 will have the Psystrike charged attack.
If you use the Mystery Box during the event, you'll have the chance to catch a Shiny Meltan. The Mystery Box is only obtained by sending a Pokémon to Pokémon Home or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! It's a bit of a hassle to get the Box, but it's well worth it, as Meltan is great for battling.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest kicks off in earnest this week, and one of the biggest presentations will be the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase on June 12. If you watch the show and find yourself clamoring for more information, Microsoft has announced an extended version of the presentation a couple of days later.
On June 14, the Xbox Games Showcase Extended airs at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern. This supplemental event features 90 minutes of new trailers, interviews, and in-depth looks at the titles shown during the Xbox & Bethesda livestream. Xbox Wire describes the presentation as “all-new,” suggesting it may be more substantial than just a rehash of the June 12 event with a few extra tidbits.   
We don’t know what the Xbox & Bethesda showcase has in store, but appearances from Starfield, Forza Motorsport 8, and Redfall seem like solid guesses. You can listen to some of our Game Informer editors pit their predictions against each other in this episode of the Game Informer Show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiplayer FPS Escape From Tarkov is getting a dedicated PvP spin-off in the form of Escape From Tarkov Arena, developers Battlestate Games have announced on Twitter. Battlestate say Arena will be a “standalone” game, so you won't need to own the original Tarkov in order to play it, but clarified that anyone who owns Escape From Tarkov’s ‘Edge of Darkess’ pack will have free access to it as DLC. Watch the teaser trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a night of being offline following the Collision event, Fortnite is back, once again shaking up the norm with new biomes to explore, skins to unlock, and gameplay techniques to master. In the final moments of last night's event, we saw Obi-Wan Kenobi locked in combat with Darth Vader. The feared Sith Lord is one of the new skins that is unlockable when you purchase this season's battle pass. At a later date in the battle pass bonus tier, archaeologist Indiana Jones will join the fight.
Fortnite Chapter 3, Season 3 is officially called Vibin', and true to form, it brings a colorful, party atmosphere to its new story thread and areas of the map. On the eastern coast, you'll see two new areas to explore: Rave Cave and Reality Falls. These Biomes feature giant mushrooms to bound across, as well as waterfalls and strange trees to interact with.
The tallest tree is called the Reality Tree and it's in full bloom, spreading Reality Seed Pods across the island. If you grab a seed and plant it, a Reality Sapling will grow. If you weed it, you'll be rewarded loot. The more times a sapling is uprooted, the better the loot. Yes, you can get Mythic weapons this way.
On the gameplay front, you can now use animals as mounts. If you see a wolf or boar, see if you can catch a ride. Ballers are also back thanks to the reappearance of the Screwballer amusement park ride. The Ballers have more health than before, can float on water, and are battery-operated, meaning you know how long the ride will be.
We'll have to wait to see what other surprises and changes await us in Vibin', but it's off to a great start, and you gotta love seeing Indiana Jones and Darth Vader joining the character ranks.
What did you think of the Collision event? And are you excited to jump into this new season? Let us know in the comments section below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we start from the beginning as we unpack one of the most influential action games ever, Devil May Cry.
Arriving stateside on October 16, 2001, the game stars Dante, a demon hunter (and half-demon himself) on a mission to stop underworld emperor Mundus from invading the human world. The game began life as Resident Evil 4, helmed by a hotshot young director named Hideki Kamiya who veered the game from survival horror to stylish action. While it proved too drastic of a departure for Resident Evil, Capcom knew they had something and reworked the project into its own franchise. Listen on to learn how Dante was conceived, our thoughts on the game’s story, and how we fared against the game’s legendarily brutal difficulty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games has partnered with Disruptive Games, the studio behind Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 and Diablo II: Resurrected, to create a new intellectual property that will release on a variety of machines. Described by Amazon Games as an online multiplayer action-adventure with cooperative and competitive play, this new experience appears to be set in a post-apocalytpic or post-war world. This observation comes from two pieces of concept art that show crashed airplanes that appear to be heavily weathered.
The humans pictured in these artworks hold primitive weapons, such as a rifle with a bayonet. One of the characters appears to have mechanical legs. Several of these beings also wear headsets with tall antenna, likely for cooperative communication.
In a press release, Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, says we can expect something different from this multiplayer experience. "The talented team at Disruptive Games is creating a fresh take on the multiplayer action-adventure genre, with strong game design and rich world-building that we're excited to help bring to players." 
On Disruptive's official website, this new IP is amusingly codenamed "super secret project." We'll have to wait for more details, but the usage of concept art with game title implies it's a long way off.]]></summary>

I scoured the internet for dinosaur titles that are in the works and found five that look promising. The last one on this list is something you can download right now. Here's what we can look forward to soon:


Jurassic Architect
. Jurassic Architect is currently in development for PC and looks incredibly ambitious, almost like a sci-fi and prehistoric Sim City. Sadly, no release date has been given.


Deathground


The Lost Wild


Paleo Pines


Dinosaur Fossil Hunter
If you are looking for something you can play on PC right now, Dinosaur Fossil Hunter was released last month, and offers a deep simulation where you are tasked to drive across open worlds to find fossil sites, and then use various gadgets to locate and dig for dinosaur bones. The collections you unearth can then be displayed in your own museum. You get to design all of the displays and arrange how the dinosaurs look.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-03T21:23:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called "Collision." This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.
The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.
Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.
If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.
If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.
What do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil fans have had a lot to celebrate over the years. Biohazard and Village have brought the series back to its horror roots in unique ways. The Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes have been a perfect way to relive the glories of the past with contemporary improvements. But what comes next? Resident Evil 4 Remake is the answer, and we're pouring over every detail of the new trailer in today's spoiler-filled breakdown.


Alex Stadnik is your host for the video and welcomes Resident Evil 4 superfan Blake Hester to dissect every nook and cranny of Capcom's surprise announcement from the latest Sony State of Play. As stated above, we go into a lot of spoilers of the original game, so if you haven't played it yet, please bookmark this video and come back.
The boys kick things off by discussing their levels of surprise when the fourth entry in the iconic series makes its first appearance. They then break the trailer down scene by scene, letting you know what they think will be different and what will stay the same. They also ponder if the remake will feature a character similar to Mr. X, Nemesis, or Lady D instead of creating a straight one-to-one recreation. Finally, they wrap by discussing whether or not the game will get delayed and what their levels of hype are after seeing Leon's return.
Are you excited about Resident Evil 4? The wait isn't too long as Capcom's next remake is launching on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC!

        <updated>2022-06-03T18:34:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega revealed a quick 30-second teaser of Sonic Frontiers gameplay earlier this week, and IGN released a full seven-minute look at the open-world gameplay of the Blue Blur’s latest. Now, you can watch more than six minutes of combat from the game, and it looks like Sonic combat…in a 3D open world. 
As we previously saw, Sonic Frontiers’ world is beautiful and one of the most realistic-looking games in the franchise’s history. Today’s combat showcase takes place in the same area as the previous gameplay premiere but with decidedly less rail grinding and more spinball fighting action. As you might expect, Sonic fights in Sonic Frontiers like he always has – lots of jump attacks, spin moves, kicks, and more. However, it seems he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Namely, an in-air jolt attack that makes him dash all over the screen before doing an interesting rotating circle attack. Take a look for yourself below: 


As you can see, Sonic is up against some new types of enemies in Sonic Frontiers, and they seem to tank a lot more damage than the Blue Blur is traditionally used to doling out. That doesn’t appear to be a problem for him, though, as he aptly takes them out with ease. We also get a look at Sonic confronting a massive creature-like machine that stands extremely tall toward the end of the video. Sonic uses some interesting moves to eventually defeat that, too. 
Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully, we don’t have to wait too much longer. In the meantime, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted earlier this week. 
What do you think of the combat in Sonic Frontiers? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 6/3/22:
During yesterday’s State of Play showcase, Sony revealed Insomniac Games’ Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered would be coming to PC on August 12. It turns out Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is actually coming to PC this year, too, according to a PlayStation Blog Post spotted by IGN. However, while Spider-Man Remastered will be released on PC this summer, the PlayStation blog says Miles Morales will “launch on PC in fall 2022,” so presumably later than August 12. 
Oddly enough, PlayStation didn’t reveal Miles Morales was coming to PC during yesterday’s showcase, an odd exclusion for a segment of the show that was all about Spider-Man’s big PC release. Nonetheless, you can play through both of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games on PC later this year.  
The original story continues below...
Original story, 6/2/22:
Have you been wanting to web-sling as Spidey on your PC? You’re in luck! Today, at Sony’s State of Play, it was announced that Insomniac’s Spider-Man is coming to PC in its remastered form on August 12. Previously, you could only play the game on PS4 and PS5. 
The remastered edition includes new assets, tech, and plenty of updates. In this edition, Peter Parker was recast to Ben Jordan to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture for PS5.
That’s right in just a few months, you’ll be able to experience the game that our own Andrew Reiner gave a 9.5, saying: “Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes.” You can read his full review here.
Want more? You can watch the reveal trailer above, which showcases the announcement and all the awesome action in store for Peter Parker.]]></summary>

Ramone Russell has been there front and center to tell us what is new in each edition of this annualized series. Ramone is Sony Interactive Entertainment's product development communications and brand strategist, but I've always jokingly called him "the face of The Show."
In the years I've interviewed Ramone about The Show, I've learned he has an inspiring story to tell. People always ask me "How do I get into the video game industry?" and there's no easy answer to that. Everyone's journey will be different, but it always requires patience and a drive to make it. That drive is the backbone of Ramone's story. He knew he wanted to get into video games and sacrificed everything numerous times to get there. I rec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.

That's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has revealed its next miniature console, the Mega Drive Mini 2. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that it will include 50 games from both the Mega Drive and Mega Drive CD, including ports of arcade games and games Sega calls “mysterious new work.” Sega revealed this mini console during a special livestream in Japan today. It included news that the company will release the Mega Drive Mini 2 on Oct. 27 (in Japan) with a roughly $75 price tag. Sega has not confirmed a release outside of Japan, according to VGC. 

VGC reports that these are the confirmed games so far:
Bonanza Bros (Mega Drive)
Fantasy Zone (because Fantasy Zone never hit the Mega Drive, this version is a port based on Super Fantasy Zone)
Magical Taruruto (Mega Drive)
Shining in the Darkness (Mega Drive)
Thunder Force IV (Mega Drive)
Virtua Racing (Mega Drive)
Mansion of Hidden Souls (Mega CD)
Popful Mail (Mega CD)
Shining Force CD (Mega CD)
Silpheed (Mega CD)
Sonic CD (Mega CD)
The Mega Drive Mini 2 follows 2019’s Mega Drive Mini, first announced in 2018. You can read our thoughts on it in the Game Informer Sega Mega Drive Mini review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You have Final Fantasy XVI on the brain if you’re anything like me. This game, which Square Enix’s Creative Business Unit III studio is developing, has admittedly been on my mind since Square Enix revealed it in 2020. However, it’s especially front and center today after the FF XVI trailer that aired during yesterday’s State of Play. 
That trailer featured new looks at gameplay, more information about the warring kingdoms, including the Empire, surrounding the story, and the key figures at the heart of it all. Yesterday’s trailer highlighted these characters because they seem to have the ability to transform into completely, or at least embody, the primals or summons seen throughout the Final Fantasy franchise – primals and summons such as Ifrit, Bahamut, Odin, Shiva, and more. Following that trailer, Square Enix has uploaded some new screenshots of the beautiful landscapes in FF XVI we’ll be trekking across, and they look fantastic. Check them out for yourself below: 

As you can see, they feature new looks at different parts of this world that we haven’t yet seen in trailers, which have focused more on the story and combat of the game than the actual setting. These screenshots shed new light on the setting, though, including multiple locales we’ll likely be visiting when the game is released next summer. 
For more, read about how an easy mode for FF XVI could be on the way, and then check out this new FF XVI art that reveals exciting story details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI was released during today's PlayStation State of Play, and it revealed a whole lot of war, turmoil, and primals. 
It also gave us extended looks at gameplay and a summer 2023 release window, which might come as a surprise considering producer Naoki Yoshida said in April that FF XVI was near the end of development. The trailer, which dove deep into the story of FF XVI, focuses on the war that will soon be waged between warring kingdoms, with the Empire seemingly leading the charge. At the heart of this war are multiple key figures who appear to have the ability to transform into (or at least embody) primals, which have traditionally been summons in Final Fantasy games.
Check them out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Here are the primals/summons seen in the trailer: 
Phoenix
Titan
Garuda
Bamuh
Shiva
Odin
Bahamut
Ifrit
Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at the game's combat, which seems to contain some unique boss fights that will feature health bars on the top of the screen. The combat throughout the gameplay looks quite flashy, too, with plenty of spin attacks, fire, and more. At the bottom right is a weapon wheel of sorts that seems to be something players can customize, complete with items, a jump action, an attack action, and a slew of magic attacks to utilize. Hopefully we learn more about all of this soon!
Final Fantasy XVI is being developed by Square Enix's Creative Business Unit III's studio, and it will be released in the summer of 2023. For more, read about how an easy mode for FF XVI could be on the way, and then check out this new FF XVI art that reveals exciting story details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't seen the jaw-dropping, peaceful-seeming indie since last year. Just a few months after its debut at The Game Awards, the title seemed to be stalled after several hostile workplace allegations. However, today's State of Play proved the game is still in development and aims to come out in Autumn. The unexpected release window is coming up quickly, but the gorgeous new trailer suggests Season: A Letter to the Future will be ready.


Season won't task you with fighting monsters or saving the world. Rather, the game puts the player in the shoes of a traveler named Estelle, who is recording everything around her for posterity. There are hints that Season's sweeping vistas, sun-drenched fields, and flowing waterfalls won't be around for future generations. The trailer explains that no one knows what will happen when "the season" ends, which makes the job of documenting the world for the future so important. We see the protagonist going about this assignment is various ways, like writing in a journal, taking photos, and recording audio. She also stops off to speak with the people around her while exploring the landscape on her bike.
As the narrative designer, Meg Hutchison explains:
The title looks like it is shaping up to be a pensive and beautiful experience when it comes out on PlayStation consoles and PC this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's State of Play debuted a quirky dating-action game called Eternights. In it, independent developer Studio Sai invites you to find love in the most trying times – during an apocalypse.  
The game challenges you to make the most of life during this catastrophic situation. That means finding life and saving the world. When a mysterious entity infects humans and turns them into monsters, you must race against the clock to find an answer for survival, especially if you want to save your new relationship. In the game, you scavenge, dungeon crawl, and date your way to answers. But be aware that you're doing it all on a deadline, with a clock constantly ticking, reminding you to meet your deadlines.
Studio Sai promises dungeons with traps and puzzles, alongside fun dancing minigames. You also get to pick from a cast of five characters for your romantic pursuits, each with their own unique stories and skills to help you battle. The action showcased in the trailer looked fast-paced and featured mostly hacking and slashing away at baddies while using the face buttons to unleash powerful skills and magical abilities. There was even a motorcycle sequence to get your adrenaline pumping. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action for yourself. 
So get ready to hold hands, makeout, and fight to stay alive when Eternights debuts on PS5, PS4, and PC sometime in early 2023.]]></summary>

First, the footage shown in the State of Play introduced a new single-player mode for SF6 called World Tour, which has players roaming the streets in an open world picking fights with other world warriors. The other is Battle Hub which is where players can throw down in matches online. Capcom states the mode will "further expand the scope of player communication and engagement."

This means I'm at work today and Friday. For other people outside the UK who don't know, this weekend it is celebrating the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. She's the first UK monarch to manage 70 years on the throne, most of the other ones having killed each other or somesuch. The country, specifically England, has responded to this by going absolutely off the boil, represented even in digi-form with a virtual street party map in Minecraft. I wouldn't normally write about it, but it gives me an excuse to republican-post on main when nobody is looking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seregios can get stuffed. I recently faced off against the massive golden dragon during a hands-on session for Sunbreak, the upcoming expansion pack for Monster Hunter Rise, and it battered me repeatedly for the best part of an hour. It has become the flying white whale to my dual blade wielding Ahab, and I left the preview event determined to chop it to bits when the DLC finally arrives later this month.


Sunbreak’s new master rank quests aren’t messing around, basically. It seems Capcom have taken criticisms that the base version of Monster Hunter Rise didn’t provide challenging enough end-game content to heart, and have loaded the expansion with some truly agonising encounters purpose-built for returning veterans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That's how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring's major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.
Yet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.

Still, that vague hint of warmth that lingers between the raindrops has got me dreaming of all those lovely things that make summer so appealing. Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.


OK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Why do we even bother leaving the house, when we can stay indoors and play video games on PC instead? June is a little sparse when it comes to new releases (as is so often the case during these warmer seasons) but there’s still plenty on the horizon to keep you occupied.

One of the best deals we've spotted is for the Asus Prime B660M-A WiFi D4, which launched at £197 and is now down to £86 at CCL in the UK.
This motherboard uses better value DDR4 memory, two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots and WiFi 6 on board, so it ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the essentials. You're missing some things from higher-end Z690 boards - like PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports and 2.5-gig networking - but nothing that affects gaming performance, at least in the here and now.

Take a sheet of plain paper, turn it horizontal, draw two long lines across it, dividing it into three strips. That’s a level; that’s a side-scrolling environment. That’s what I’d do, basically all the time, basically every day. You could call me a budding game designer, only I had no knowledge of how to transfer my genius creations into digital form. I’d tried before, with Doom, but the editor was incomprehensible. Sectors? Vectors? Call me a particularly stupid child, but I just wanted to draw two long lines on a piece of paper.


Enter Speedy Eggbert, a budget-priced platform game that scored “the world’s first generous 4% review” in PC Gamer magazine. But I wasn’t aware of that yet. I was, though, aware of its big, shiny box on the shelves of Game, with its gorgeously embossed Eggbert and a reverse emblazoned with screenshots and features, including the most enticing few words I’d ever seen – “MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS!”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we have another AOC gaming monitor, except it’s not just by AOC, but by posh car makers Porsche? It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.


It’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I'm happy to report that game is now out in early access. It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion's key features work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast Four Word is a clever idea. It's a Wordle-like in which you begin with a four-letter starting word and must enter a new word which changes just a single letter. So if the starting word is AHEM, as it was yesterday, you could change the first letter and enter THEM. 

From there, you have 44 seconds to chain together as many new words as you can, with plenty of other twists to make it more challenging.

The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they're actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with. The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends and loved ones will agree, I have big “background character” energy. If I lived in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn’t be a Jedi or a Sith inquisitor. I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I've seen for ages.
It's more than just stylish, too. As I've mentioned before, I'm bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I'm not going to do a pun about the name. I'm not. I'm definitely not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I finished Yakuza: Like A Dragon and felt a little bit lost. You know the feeling, right? When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
