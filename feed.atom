Farming games are well-tilled territory. It’s near-impossible to play a new one without comparing it to the many predecessors on Switch. Everdream Valley knows this, and uses it to both its benefit and detriment.
Released on PC and PlayStation last month from newbie developer Mooneaters and publisher Untold Tales, this debut squeezes its way onto the Switch’s crowded farming sim market (farmers market?). The game does a lot differently; unfortunately, we found those differences didn’t necessarily make for a better farm sim experience. But, depending on how you play other farm sims, your (horse) mileage may vary.

Rather than going for the same figure approach, Zuljaras' latest build is much more practical as they transformed their Nintendo 64 console into a StarCraft 64 battlefield, complete with different terrains, bases and Protoss, Zerg and Terran units. All of the models were created by hand using polymer clay and are permanently fused to the console, making it the ultimate StarCraft machine!

In an update, the Game Boy has apparently been retired from active duty. 'VGArtandTidbits' on Twitter asked one of the Nintendo New York Store employees about it "after not seeing it on display for a while" and was informed the famous handheld had been returned to Nintendo's headquarters in Redmond Washington.

In fact, they made the game with multiplayer sessions in mind.

Often this is all in slow-motion. Trepang2 is unashamedly aiming to be a new F.E.A.R. and does a pretty great job of it for a game made by a core team of only four people (plus external artists and such). Give me a shotgun, a slidekick, and slo-mo, and I'm happy.

Over the far-too-many years I’ve been with Destructoid, I don’t think there is an article I’ve written that’s caused me as much trouble as this one.
Despite the fact you’re seeing more of these on this website, listicles are hard. Whether it’s something simple like ranking family games or trying to sum up an entire console catalog in just ten spots, writing articles like this can cause a type of anguish no review or impressions piece ever could. I’d much rather try to explain the gameplay of the latest Nobunaga’s Ambition to an octogenarian than try to whittle down a list of the best Nintendo DS games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A second Lord of the Rings project has also been canceled
Daedalic Entertainment is closing its Hamburg, Germany studio and shifting focus, following the reception to The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. The publisher will now fully focus its efforts on its publishing business.
First reported by Games Wirtschaft, Daedalic confirms to Polygon as well that it's shifting focus. Daedalic is closing its internal Hamburg studio, which developed Gollum, and canceled a second project based on The Lord of the Rings IP.
Games Wirtschaft's report indicates 25 employees will be affected. In a statement to Polygon, Daedalic says it will support those former employees in "finding new opportunities" within its network. Additionally, Daedalic says it will continue to work on a patch for Gollum, which was released in May. The publisher confirms that the stealth-action game "did not live up to the expectations" it had for Gollum.
My precious
There's no hiding that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was a massive flop. It sits at a rare 37 on OpenCritic, with only 4% of critics recommending it. As Will Cruz writes for our sister site, The Escapist: "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is quite possibly the worst game I've played in 2023 so far."
Having played a demo of it a while back and walking away baffled, I'm not terribly surprised. Regardless of Gollum's quality, though, seeing developers fall on hard times is never a good thing. Hopefully, those affected can find a new path forward in the industry.
As for Lord of the Rings video games, well, this seems to have salted the earth on Gollum. It feels like it's been a bit since we saw the last great LOTR game. Return to Moria is currently set for a fall 2023 release date, so maybe that can rattle the dust off the series a bit.

This week I was supposed to be doing Brave Fencer Musashi. However, I forgot to save at one point and lost more than two hours of progress, which really took the wind out of my sails. Years of autosave have completely atrophied my "save early, save often" instinct. So I needed something else on my shelf that I could play in short order. Incredible Crisis wasn't something I had played before, but it seemed like it would fit the bill.
I knew two things about this game: it’s weird, and it’s really short. Oh, wait. That also means that I don’t know if it’s good or not. Did I choose the right column for it? Oh no, what if it’s bad? I really should have done more homework first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Diablo 4 developer update livestream
Mark your calendar. Blizzard has set the date for the next Diablo 4 developer livestream: July 6th at 11AM PST. The stream will feature Lead Game Producer Timothy Ismay and Associate Game Director Joe Piepiora as they detail some upcoming quality-of-life updates and officially announce Season 1 of Diablo 4.
Apparently Diablo Immortal will also make an appearance in the stream to discuss a new class coming mid-July. This is a bit strange as the two games certainly don't share the same player base, even if they are both Diablo games. Either way, you can catch the dual livestream on the official Diablo Twitch channel.
https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1674826164995604484
Quality-of-life and Season 1 details are coming for Diablo 4
I have to admit, Blizzard's handling of Diablo 4 post-release has been pretty spectacular so far. The recent patch 1.03 we received on June 27th fixed a lot of bugs, provided a ton of class balance changes, and added a ton of quality-of-life (QoL) features to the game. Experience gains have increased all over the game, and Nightmare Dungeons are more rewarding to run. With quality-of-life updates being a focus of the livestream, I imagine we'll see even more improvements on the way.
More importantly, Season 1 information is on the way. Executive Producer Rod Fergusson already confirmed we'd be getting the release date next week, which will probably be in this livestream. Furthermore, I think we'll get some details on the new features and content coming in the first season. This will probably include details about the Season 1 battle pass. Unfortunately, we know there will be no leaderboards just yet.
If you're interested be sure to check out the Diablo 4 developer update livestream on July 6th at 11AM PST.

If you’re only a casual or intermediate lover of scrolling shoot-’em-ups, it’s easy to drown in the deep end. The genre has been unfathomably popular in Japanese Game Centres for decades, so just about every publisher of arcade games at the time had multiple series going. So, you’ll have to excuse me if I haven’t played every game featured in the Ray’z Arcade Chronology. I mean, I’ve heard of them. Not that I could tell you when and where because the names RayForce, RayStorm, and RayCrisis are so laughably similar that I can’t keep them straight.
That’s okay. A lifetime of experience with the genre has given me ample framework to appreciate each of these games, and appreciate them I did.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confounded by the Rayz.
The limited edition retailers are getting out of hand again. The Ray'z Arcade Chronology, originally released in Japan back in March, and published by Taito for Switch and PlayStation 4, is receiving a European release courtesy of ININ games. Bizarrely, ININ Games are releasing two different compilations: this, the Ray’z Arcade Chronology, and the RayStorm X RayCrisis HD Collection. The latter, available in both physical and digital versions, only includes the HD touchups of RayStorm and RayCrisis, losing RayForce from the lineup. This makes it more a nerfed edition than a limited edition, and its existence somewhat baffling. Confounding things further, Strictly Limited Games have already released and subsequently sold out of its own physical version of the Ray’z Arcade Chronology, which contained all three titles plus an exclusive in R-Gear, an unearthed, unfinished prototype RayForce sequel.
The thinking behind these chopped-up, multi-licensed variations is bizarre, and sadly R-Gear isn’t present on ININ’s digital Ray’z Arcade Chronology. Despite this, it’s a fine package thanks to seasoned port-masters M2. Presentation is excellent, with nicely bound menus and plenty of information attached to its various screens. On board are five versions of three games, in that RayStorm and RayCrisis feature both original and new high-definition versions. Much like we saw with G-Darius HD, these remasters are beautiful enough that the originals are relegated to little more than historical curios; and, unless you’re using a CRT in an attempt to replicate the original look, they’re wholly overshadowed by M2’s upscaling work. That said, M2 has included a 'no burn-in' screen option precisely for people interested in running the games on old tech.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. 
Watch on Twitch!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-30T17:00:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A "bit" of news
First launched by Choice Provisions (formerly known as Gaijin Games) in 2009, the Bit.Trip series has endured a lot. The fact that it's still standing after getting its start on the much-maligned (but beautifully scored) WiiWare service almost 15 years ago proves that it has legs. Now those legs are moving into the maker space with Bit.Trip Rerunner; a brand new title in the franchise.
Originally there were six games in the Bit.Trip story (Beat, Core, Void, Runner, Fate and Flux), but then Runner really took off, inspiring two numbered sequels and one free mobile spin-off. Both of which featured Charles Martinet (best known for voicing Mario) in a prominent role. So in a roundabout way, it makes sense for the Bit.Trip Runner subseries to continue to follow in Mario's footsteps with this new "Maker" title.
Details are scant, but the Choice Provisions Twitter page tells us that Rerunner will have "Over 150 new levels, each with increasing challenges", a new "Runner-Maker tool to create and share your own levels" and "gameplay mechanics inspired by the original Bit.Trip games".
The feature I think most Bit.Trip fans will want to see is the option to play with the original voxel visual style. Mario Maker definitely spoiled us by giving us Mario 1, 3, World, and "New" modes to play with. Unbeknownst to many, the Bit.Trip Runner series has used five distinctly different visual styles in past games as well (voxel, Atari 2600-style flat sprites, NES-style sprites,  2D drawings, and rounded polygons), so the options are already there.
We may find out if Rerunner will rerun all four of those looks when we see the game in action!

You're leading a 4X-ish effort to establish a power base in an unfamiliar galaxy. But you're not doing it to conquer everyone or win victory points. You're doing it so you can go back home and save Earth from annihilation.

The summer's usually a quieter time for new releases as we await the holiday season rush (Nintendo's October and November are already taken care of), but that means for now, we can really concentrate on quality over quantity.
We've been busy rounding up our usual selection of games headed to retail in the coming weeks, including some highlights picked by us as well as lots of other games and accessories that are launching soon. Pikmin 4's certainly the standout this month, but have a browse through and see if anything takes your fancy:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ruinarch is based on a concept many of you have thought of at some point. What if, instead of building up villages and hunting down hostile monsters and evil overlords, you were playing as the Dark Lord?
It's been done most famously in Dungeon Keeper or Overlord, but those were quite conventional structurally. Sure, you were playing as the baddies, but still doing mostly the same things as in other games, twirling your moustache the whole time. Ruinarch feels not like one of those thematic remixes of an established structure, but an attempt to build a new subgenre. Now that it's reached a full release, it also, sadly, feels like a demonstration of how difficult that really is.

It looks like the fan-made Fallout 4 project Fallout: London is going to be pretty spectacular upon release. Taking place in the English capital city, this mod takes the post-apocalyptic RPG overseas, and the modders behind it now have a better idea of when they want to launch it.
In the latest progress video over on YouTube, the team gave us an extra taste of what's to come in Fallout: London. Lead 3D artist Kordan "SunnyDelight" Albon shows off a gnarly-looking trebuchet, complete with animation. While there's still some work to be done on the enormous siege weapon, you can see it in action as it hurls a projectile toward Big Ben.

What I can tell you is that the SpongeBob Squarepants DLC for PowerWash Simulator confirms that PowerWash DLC is now the only way I will consume content about pop culture I do not understand. The most elaborate Spiderverse-themed skins for Fortnite, with all the custom dances they can muster, are as shadows and dust next to methodically cleaning an orange submarine car while a fictional octopus sends you sad texts. I'm convinced PowerWash Sim could do a crossover with literally any intellectual property and make it work. Lego. Mad Men. The filmography of Nicolas Cage. Clean them all.

Pikmin 4 is gearing up for a July 21 launch, but Nintendo started the marketing campaign in earnest in the last Nintendo Direct, which dedicated a decent chunk of time toward the new series entry. Of course, the next stage of that campaign: My Nintendo swag!
As you may recall, Nintendo celebrated the re-release Pikmin 3 in 2020 with a sticker and coaster set. Well, in a recent news post on the My Nintendo site, the publisher confirmed that there will be a sticker set coming in the future for Pikmin 4. Here's the full rundown from Nintendo:
"Add some cuteness to your smooth surfaces with these lovely 3” x 3” stickers! One features a Blue Pikmin, a Yellow Pikmin, and a Red Pikmin ready for whatever’s next. The other shows an explorer and a squad of Pikmin riding on the back of space dog Oatchi."

Given the timeframe of prior announcements, it could be anywhere between 1-2 weeks until we see the set go up on the My Nintendo storefront. Expect the price to be in line with prior sticker sets on the service, ranging from 300-500 Platinum Points.
There's also a Pikmin 4 demo promo for free Platinum
In other My Nintendo news, there's a Pikmin 4 retailer demo promo going on soon, which can net you 200 Platinum Points.
All you need to do is play the demo of the game at select retailers, then scan a QR code at the end. That's it! This particular gimmick will be running from July 7 through October 19, so you have plenty of time. Nintendo mentions Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart by name.

Off the back of the trip, I've finally decided to get my act together and pursue a long, arduous road to some degree of fluency. It's always going to be a work-in-progress, but I think I've settled into a language learning routine which leaves me with plenty of time for Love Island in the evening. DuoLingo's owl has been punted to the curb, too, because the bird is awful.
Naturally, I've turned to a textbook: Genki I. At first I thought there was no getting past it being a bit dry - I mean they aren't meant to be thrillers, are they? Until, that was, I discovered Game Gengo, a YouTuber who takes each lesson from the textbook, breaks them down into manageable chunks, all complete with loads of examples from video games. I spend most of my evenings with the guy, and what a treat it is.

It has been almost two years since our last instalment of Deltarune, Toby Fox's follow-up to Undertale and, given the three-year wait between the first two chapters, this isn't all that surprising. However, Fox has recently shared an update on the development of Chapter 3 to keep us all in the loop about what's going on (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
Released as a part of his free newsletter, Fox noted that progress is still being made on Chapter 3, with the team working on the final overworld area for the instalment. After this, it looks like the chapter should be almost ready to go with Fox stating that he will need to give it a thorough once-over — though he hopes that this won't take too long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Thought is the labour of the intellect, reverie is its pleasure".
Movement is such an integral part of the Trails/Kiseki series – both in a literal and figurative sense. The focus on transportation, walking, and familiarising yourself with the geography and inhabitants of Zemuria is paired with moments of political navigation, those who refuse to move on, and people growing from their mistakes. And after the events of Trails of Cold Steel IV, there’s a lot of movement – people are trying to move on from the events of five months ago.
In The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie, there’s plenty of player movement – moving between characters and stories – coupled with the aftermath of the Great Twilight. While recovery is slow and change is imminent in the Erebonian Empire, the state of Crossbell is at last reclaiming its independence. These are two nations in flux, moving on from the past. But there are new forces that threaten to disrupt this new chapter for Zemuria. This results in a solid and unconventional entry in the Trails series, albeit one that feels like a bit of a cheap excuse to get all of your favourite characters together.

If you're a fan of 2D hack 'n' slash titles with an added element of roguelike, then the upcoming Death or Treat from publisher Perp Games might just be up your alley.
The game is already out on Steam and PS5, but the Switch version will be launching on July 11th, 2023, so not too far off at all. It follows Scary, the owner of a Halloween candy manufacturer called Ghost Mart. You'll be exploring ever-changing handpainted worlds as you encounter hordes of enemies and utilise one of three core combat styles: fast, heavy, or ranged.

We first heard that the gorgeous ex-battler Thirsty Suitors would be coming to Switch in Annapurna Interactive's 2022 showcase, but now, one year on, the game appeared in this year's presentation and served up a release date of 2nd November to boot.
The all-new trailer does a pretty good job of showing the kind of action that will be in store, and we'll do our best to summarise it for you here too. Developed by Outerloop Games, Thirsty Suitors is a story-driven adventure game where you play as Jala, our young protagonist, who returns to her family home only to find her relationships in disarray. Her sister isn't talking to her, her parents seem disappointed, oh, and all of her exes are out to either fight and/or flirt with her — that last one feels important.

In this smart murder mystery detective game from the creator of Ace Attorney, you play the recently deceased amnesiac Sissel as he attempts to piece together his own demise. Who killed him? And why? And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning. Thus begins a frantic night of whodunnit puzzling at its finest, with director Shu Takumi showing us exactly what he's made of outside the courtroom dramas he built his name on.

Niantic hit the big time with Pokémon GO and rapidly expanded into multiple other augmented reality-driven mobile experiences. Unfortunately, post-pandemic it's now experiencing a rough patch - with an update on the company website and email to employees revealing Niantic is axing two games and letting go of 230 employees as part of its LA studio closure.
Niantic CEO John Hanke told employees and fans how the company had decided to "narrow" its focus on certain mobile game investments. NBA All-World will be sunset and production on Marvel: World of Heroes will come to a halt.

It's hard to believe but Everybody 1-2-Switch! is actually already available in some parts of the world after its rather low-key announcement earlier this month.
As part of the multiplayer party game's launch, the title has received a day one update - bumping the game to Version 1.0.1. It's one of those patches where apparently some things have changed behind the scenes and Nintendo sums it up as a patch to "improve the overall gameplay experience".

        <updated>2023-06-29T23:00:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an Xbox version, but it needs more time
Today, Larian Studios announced that it's moving up the release date of Baldur's Gate 3 on PC and slightly delaying the PS5 version. Alongside those platforms, the studio says an Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 is still in the works. It's just a matter of getting it ready.
In a community update around the announcement, Larian said it's optimistic about Baldur's Gate 3 on the Xbox Series X. But in order to announce and release on Xbox, the studio will need to "ensure the game is performing without compromise across the entire Xbox X|S ecosystem."
Essentially? "Like with the PS5 version, we'll release it when it's ready," Larian said. "We'll update you as soon as we can."
Splitting the screens
Larian head Swen Vincke went into more detail about the status of the Xbox version in an interview with IGN. Vincke noted both the freedom of the game itself, and the split-screen co-op, as causes for its troubles. Vincke told IGN that Larian may have to make some "compromises" to get an Xbox version live, though he didn't specify what they were, and didn't want to confirm that would be the case for-sure.
Vincke also confirms that Larian is working with Microsoft's Xbox Advanced Technology Group (Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on the matter to IGN).
As the interview goes on, Vincke does say that the team's ambition is to release Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X|S this year, but it can't commit to that. Again, it's ready when it's ready.
"This one's not exclusive. You're going to be able to play it. It's just a matter of patience. This is really a question of time," Vincke said.
As for PC and PS5 players, the wait for Baldur's Gate 3 has shifted a bit with today's news. PC players will get the massive RPG on August 3, while PS5 players have to wait just a little bit longer for September 6.

In a new Endgadget interview, Bloober's co-founder Piotr Babieno stated that 2023 is the end of Bloober's foray into psychological horror.
"This year is like closing the era of making psychological horror games," Babieno said. “Right now we are going into Bloober Team 3.0, making mass-market horror.”
According to Engadget's piece, Bloober will rely on "action" and "player input", which Bloober hopes will expand its audience.

The Steam Summer Sale 2023 is officially live, offering deep discounts on hundreds of games across the Steam platform. From now until July 23 at 10 a.m. PT, tons of games have gone on sale. There's AAA titles, indie games, and everything in between.
While previous Summer Sales have often featured a fun little mini-game, it doesn't look like there's one this year. Instead, The Points Shop features a special Summer in the City section with new cosmetics for your Steam profile.

As part of the Annapurna Showcase 2023, the publisher has revealed that Thirsty Suitors will be arriving on November 2, 2023.
Initially revealed back in 2021, Thirsty Suitors is a stylish mash-up of so many things. Coming to us from developer Outerloop Games, it takes skateboarding, combat, and cooking and drops them into a slice-of-life casserole. “Battle your exes, disappoint your parents, find yourself,” the trailer says. Yeah, I can totally relate to all of those things on a nauseatingly deep level. It’s all about going back home and seeing familiar faces again. That sounds like hell! Count me in!
https://youtu.be/4LIj46_R62M
There’s a lot here, so it’s fortunate that Destructoid’s very own Eric “Peachfuzz” Van Allen went toe-to-toe with its demo last year. I’m still not entirely sure what to make of this whole thing, but Thirsty Suitors looks pretty awesome. It brings together relatable themes gussied up with some irresistible weirdness. I don’t know what I’m looking at, but I am entirely on board. There's currently a demo that you can check out if, like me, you are curious about what this game has to offer.
Thirst Suitors releases for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch platforms November 2, 2023.

Niantic, the mobile developer known for games like Pokémon Go and Pikmin Bloom, is making some big cuts. The company is shuttering its Los Angeles office, closing down NBA All-World, cancelling an upcoming Marvel project, and laying off roughly 230 employees.
In an email to employees, as first reported by Kotaku, Niantic CEO John Hanke says he has made the decision to narrow the company's focus for mobile game investments.
"The mobile gaming market is very mature and only the best and most differentiated titles have a chance to succeed," Hanke said.
Specifically, Niantic is closing its LA studio and reducing the game platform team, alongside reductions across the company, which will result in "around 230" employees laid off. NBA Al…]]></summary>

As part of the Annapurna Showcase today, the publisher unveiled Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. Alongside it, they’ve dropped a trailer that shows practically nothing, but I still want it right now.
Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is coming from Annapurna Interactive’s internal development team. Set between the original movie and Blade Runner 2049. It occurs after the Great Blackout depicted in Blade Runner Black Out 2022. You’re cast as a retired Blade Runner who is doing… something.
https://youtu.be/QCgmRTexkEU
Details are sparse! We see the aesthetics that make the franchise so memorable, and there’s some spooky narration, but not much else. That's good enough for me! The only additional details I can find are on the Steam page, which has the tags “Adventure,” “Exploration,” and “Investigation,” but nothing else really solid. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. Dammit.
In the meantime, I can catch up on some of the Blade Runner flicks. I've only really watched the first film.
Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is currently slated for PC and “console.” There’s no release window, but it will probably be within the next decade. It would be really weird to see it actually released in 2033 or after.

While most of the announcements were updates on games we already knew about, there are a couple of cool new things in there that I'm personally quite pumped for, including a new Blade Runner game being developed internally at Annapurna Interactive, a new Keita Takahashi joint about a kid stuck in a T-pose of all things, and a new ghostly biking game from the team behind Nidhogg. I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below.

But rest assured, Flock is still very much a game you can play on your own, without the need to have a pal along for the ride, the devs tell me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JACKPOT! JACKPOT! JACKPOT!
Loot your change drawer, Zen Studios has confirmed that Pinball FX is going to drop on Switch next week. July 6, 2023, to be precise.
To be clear, this is the–I don’t know–reboot of Pinball FX. Because they got up to Pinball FX3 and then decided to start the sequence over. This is especially interesting because you can already get Pinball FX3 on Switch. Pinball FX is kind of built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4. I’m not sure why that’s necessary, but it means that your tables don’t carry over from the previous Pinball FX games. That kind of puts a damper on things.
https://youtu.be/GSZYXzYaEaw
But, hey, it’s free to play. You get a one-day pass to try out everything. Afterward, you’re left with three tables you can play in unlimited fashion: West Rampage, Fish Tales, and Sorcerer's Lair. Tables after that are bought a la carte, or in small bundles. Other versions allow you to buy pinball coins or a pinball pass as another way of playing, but this won’t initially be part of the Switch version. The Switch is getting 21 tables that the platform hasn’t had before, so that’s something.
I still feel scorned by the fact that Zen Studios got their hands on the Williams and Bally licenses, which were previously held by Farsight Studios for their game, Pinball Arcade. I loved Pinball Arcade because it felt like it was trying to be extremely faithful to the tables. It was kneecapped after losing those licenses and never recovered. However, Zen Studios seems to have gotten better about their authenticity, so maybe I’ll eventually finally migrate. It just still hurts, you know?
Pinball FX is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms. It releases on Switch July 6, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 
Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 
Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 
Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

This news comes by way of today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, where developer Outerloop Games released a new trailer showing off more of what to expect in this RPG that's one part a skateboarding game, another part a cooking game, and always a game about confronting your exes and parents. It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: 


As you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. 
Thirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2.

It's official: three of six super rare Unique items in Diablo 4 have been found. After almost a full month of players slaying demons every day, the ultra-rare Unique sword The Grandfather has finally dropped for someone.

Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy XVI has already sold 3 million copies across both physical and digital formats. Even though that's a bit behind the start that Final Fantasy XV had, it's important to highlight some key differences between the two launches.

If you’re unfamiliar with 2022’s Save Room, so am I. It’s an inventory management puzzle game based on the best part of 2005’s Resident Evil 4: the inventory. The goal was to arrange the various oddly-shaped objects into the limited space of the inventory case.
Save Room: The Merchant shifts the concept closer to the Resident Evil 4 singularity. You’re made to think outside the case as you purchase items from the legally-distinct merchant character to prepare for the rigors of a level. You just need to make sure your adventurer has everything they need while trying to balance your pocketbook. There will be 40 bespoke levels that promise “relaxing music and sound effects.”

Save Room was something of an indie darling, so it’s great to see it continue on its legally-distinct way. I’m not as organization-obsessed as some gamers, but I do like optimization, so I’d probably enjoy it. You probably would too.
Save Room: The Merchant is currently targeting PC, but no release window has been mentioned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.
Wild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license. This means the teams and stadiums of the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.
"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st," the community update reads. "Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date."
Meanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, "This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it," likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.
The community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.

Baldur's Gate 3 is moving up its launch date by almost a month for PC players. Larian Studios announced that Baldur's Gate 3 will come to PC on August 3 now, while the PlayStation 5 version will launch a week later than expected on September 6.
Originally, Baldur's Gate 3 was set for August 31 on both PC and PS5. However, with an increasingly busy late-summer launch window, it looks like Larian isn't holding onto Baldur's Gate 3 for longer than it needs to.
"Reaching a technical bar that matches our design ambitions felt like the right move, while holding back the PC version when we knew we’d be ready felt like the wrong move in such a busy launch period," said Michael Douse, director of publishing.
PlayStation 5, meanwhile, is looking solid according to Larian…]]></summary>

The game is a real platter of genres, mixing flavours of RPG, management sim, visual novel and more to create a unique kind of experience that made a real splash while it was in early access. Dave's quite popular tenure in early access had three chapters to its name, but the full release takes that number up to seven alongside new weapons, areas, and features for the deep-sea-explorathon. Take a look at the new release trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Illusion Island is an upcoming “Mickeyvania” exclusive to Switch and after being revealed over a year ago, it’s finally out next month. Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day. 
Check out the latest Disney Illusion Island story trailer for yourself below: 


For more about Disney Illusion Island, watch the reveal trailer from last summer and then check out this gameplay trailer from February. After that, read about the game’s lack of combat and a Metroid-style map.
Disney Illusion Island hits Switch on July 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week on June 23, and less than a week later, Square Enix has announced it has shipped and digitally sold 3 million copies. 
It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indiescovery is recorded a week before we release it, and never has this small time delay been more apparant than in our latest episode. Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.
Oh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.

You simply need to pick a password which meets its rules, but it keeps introducing more and more which become sillier and sillier. It's a good joke and grows into quite a tricky puzzle game too.

Let's assume you didn't watch that, though. Let's assume that you, like me, were by that point too exhausted from 90 second trailers to tune in. Let's instead watch these videos now, since they've just been uploaded as separate videos, to learn more about Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty's new district, Dogtown.

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023.

They're a total game-changer that I couldn't go without - and thanks to this deal on Amazon US, soon you won't have to either. 
You can currently pick up a dual-monitor stand that accommodates two monitors up to 32 inches in size or 17.6 pounds in weight for just $15 when you use code LHEMYSVN and you're an Amazon Prime member. That's an incredible deal for a dual monitor arm that normally costs $46 and comes with over 15,000 ratings with an average score of 90%.

I've been playing Quantum Break since it arrived on PC Game Pass, and I'm finding their oft-forgotten time-bending shooter is yet another modern Remedy game full of boring gunfights even as it gives you supernatural powers that could replace guns. Their apparent disinterest in gunfights is especially felt in a game so into telling a story that it ends chapters with TV-length live-action episodes starring actual Lance Reddick. Looking back over their past games, agh, as much as I want spooky investigations, I can't get excited about their next, Alan Wake 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics announced their brand new squad tactics game, I've been dying to get my hands on Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. While Mimimi's previous games took place in mostly grounded historical settings, Shadow Gambit is about magical undead pirates hunting for mysterious booty and fighting a persecutive Inquisition. This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.
"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting," Abé tells me. "That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay. We were restricted by realism, so that was a core pillar. It had to be something fantasy, or sci-fi or something non-realistic."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been excited to play Final Fantasy XVI for ages, but after hearing about Game of Thrones' influence on the game, I was afraid I'd be overwhelmed by dense fantasy lore. While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

In an email to employees shared with GamesIndustry.biz, CEO Amélie Lamarche said “the game only sold 60,000 copies during its first five months, which falls far short of what the studio needs to survive.” Lamarche notes that discounts, critical praise, and game updates didn’t move the needle, and now only 16 employees are left at the studio after downsizing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the ambitious follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild, finally hit Switch last month. We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dear Villagers and developer Fallen Leaf Studios have released a new trailer on IGN for Fort Solis, the upcoming sci-fi horror game starring Roger Clark and Troy Baker. 
This trailer starts with Baker discussing how he came to be involved with Fort Solis and why he’s excited about the game before he reveals it hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. 
Fort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22.

Unsurprisingly, these monitors also cost a huge amount of money, with even lower-end options in the £600+ range and higher-end examples in the quadruple figures. 
Two or three years on, things have settled down and these HDMI 2.1 monitors are now much more affordable - if not yet exactly cheap. One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs.

        <updated>2023-06-26T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. 
For more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.]]></summary>

Showdown was the mode's name; something for the animal fight pit lovers in the room, rather than the plain old animal lovers. That mode has now been spun into a free standalone release aptly called Temtem Showdown, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between the Super Mario Bros. Movie and several announcements during last week's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo's mascot is having a great 2023. Carrying on the Mario momentum, Oreo announced a limited-edition cookie collab with the iconic Nintendo franchise.
The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

The confusion began yesterday, June 25, when Bethesda's support Twitter account tweeted that all physical versions of the upcoming game would include a code instead of a disc, a message that was later deleted without clarification. You can read all about that in the original version of this post below, but that same support account responded this afternoon with a link to a June 11 blog post detailing the release details and stating...
"Starfield Standard Edition is included with Xbox Game Pass. Game disc included with physical purchases of Xbox Standard Edition. Game code included with physical purchases on PC Standard edition."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week while I was away from my desk, Pete Hines showed that the Starfield hype train is an unstoppable perpetual motion engine, and he certainly won't pull the emergency break for something as normie as a federal court. While his comments were part of the ongoing Actiblizz acquisition malarkey (the point seemingly being "it's so big it'd be too hard to optimise for PS5"), hearing him pitch Bethesda's upcoming grey-rocks-but-in-space-this-time RPG as "irresponsibly large" made me want to go full Reggie Perrin.
Every time I bring my reviews of giant games to the altar of the industry, I weep tears of blood and beg that games be shorter. And every time the golden idol with the face of Phil Spencer opens its maw to spit a new £80 disc out and says: "Bigger than ever before. A million pointless collectibles. A feast of zero-calorie content. Lol. Lmao."

That impressive feat goes to BattleBit Remastered, a 254-player FPS that mixes Battlefield’s large-scale skirmishes, Roblox’s low-poly aesthetics, and some wild destructible environments.

The cyber attacks prevented many players from logging into Diablo IV, and the hack-and-slashers that managed to log in were at risk of “high latency and disconnections” in the always-online RPG. That tragically forced many gamers to step outside during the hottest weekend in recent memory. Thankfully, Blizzard now states the DDoS attacks have ended, meaning everything should be working as normal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ve středu vyšlo Go 1.21 RC2. V RC1 se totiž objevila chyba, ta byla opravena a vydáno bylo hned RC2. Mezi hlavní změny patří PGO (profile based optimization). To už bylo k testování v Go 1.20, ale v 1.21 již bude k ostrému nasazení. Stačí mít v hlavním adresáři soubor default.pgo a PGO bude použito. Očekává se zrychlení 2–7 %. Vlastní Go 1.21 je také kompilováno s PGO a kompiluje o 2–4 % rychleji (záleží na architektuře).]]></summary>

Promising an unconventional approach to rollercoaster construction as players design the theme park of their dreams, Limbic Entertainment’s Park Beyond is yet another business-building simulator that attempts to blend "unlimited" creativity with fiscal responsibility. A familiar pitch with some quirky set dressing, you’ll create your own custom coasters, plop down drag-and-drop shops, and hire staff to create a successful venture that’s profitable and exciting – but most importantly, profitable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox corporate vice president Sarah Bond has claimed that Activision Blizzard demanded Microsoft provide a larger revenue share to put new Call of Duty games on the platform, according to a new report from IGN. 
This news comes from yesterday's court trial between Xbox (and Activision Blizzard) and the Federal Trade Commission over Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Sonic Central stream to celebrate the anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, Sonic Team announced that the second free content update on Sonic Frontiers' 2023 roadmap, titled Sonic's Birthday Bash, is available today. The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

That's the journey I've been on with deckbuilding RPG Cross Blitz this week. I first heard about it last month back when word hit that it was coming to early access this year, and I was instantly taken with its chunky animal character sprites. There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Superstars received prime placement in both the Summer Game Fest 2023 stream and this week's Nintendo Direct. As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

Usually, when I read a game description like that, I’m already grabbing my cushion to hide behind and readying my cute puppy compilation video on a second screen, but Team17 have heavily leaned into the campy side of slasher horror with humour serving as the perfect buffer. No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. 
Here’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.

The injunction would further prevent Microsoft's acquisition deal of Activision Blizzard from going through. 

Several of Xbox's high profile figures testified at the first day of trial, including the likes of Sarah Bond, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships and business development at Microsoft, Bethesda head of publishing Pete Hines, and Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. They were questioned on a range of things including cloud gaming, Call Of Duty exclusivity, and Bobby Kotick's revenue share demands.

Like, sure, you could attach the horror tag to it on Steam if you wanted, but it's more of a costume for you to enjoy - like the family down the street who are really into Halloween and turn their suburban semi into a haunted house with a movie-quality zombie in the front yard. It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You’re playing a game you really like; the action is tight, the visuals are impressive, and the systems are engaging. Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-22T19:17:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

I really enjoyed my time with it, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in the official Game Informer review (which you can read here). From its explosive story to its fast-paced and robust combat, it’s a treat for any Final Fantasy fan, especially those looking for an extra dose of action. However, it’s still a Final Fantasy, meaning there are dozens of hours of content to experience, from the main story to the side quests, hunts, and more. 
With FFXVI now behind me after more than 65 hours (although I’m still tinkering with the idea of getting the Platinum trophy for it on PlayStation 5), I’m excited to share with you 10 tips and tricks I think you should know before getting started in FFXVI.

While Sonic Mania was a 2D platformer, the studio's first game under their new name brings them into the realm of 3D, taking an incredibly vibrant colour palette that would certainly work in any classic Sonic game, and marrying it a world that one could say is mildly reminiscent of the hedgehog's rival Mario.

It apparently helps to crib the mining, mineral hoarding, and maladroit approach to industrial safety that makes source material Deep Rock Galactic one of the best FPS games going.
Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn't have as good a ring to it (no one's going to be quoting "it's in the entertainment," any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.

And one of the main reasons I enjoyed my 65+ hours with it was the combat. It’s fast-paced and bombastic and continues to grow more and more robust as you play through the game’s story. 
However, it can be difficult. As someone with dozens of hours in the game (and still playing more as I stretch into its endgame content) and a pretty good handle on FFXVI’s combat, I’m here to help with that! Here are 10 tips and tricks to help you dominate the battlefield in FFXVI.

The match was too close to call – 1990 to 1995 – but I wasn't keeping track. All that stood between my team and victory was a chubby crocodile with a vacuum. I danced and jumped around him as he used his big belly and Luigi's Mansion-like hoover to bounce me around like a loose piece of cat fluff. I just needed a few moments to deposit my Wumpa Fruit, and victory would be ours. I had my blinders on, and that was a mistake. The enemy team's Wumpa Fruit meter quickly filled to 2000, and the match was over. My…]]></summary>

The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

There are flayed corpses everywhere, fathers are haunted by the ghosts of their dead sons, blokes cram flaming eyeballs into their skulls and sometimes a guy turns up at random just to stomp you (and a lot of other people) into fleshy jam on the ground. Given all the abject suffering that the game and its predecessors make their stock and trade, it was an especially nice surprise to see real, genuine positivity emerge out of the literal hellscape of Sanctuary.

Guttural sounds echoed from ebony nests; pounding steps grew louder the longer my marines stayed still.

Arriving on October 24, this package is headlined by its HD remasters of Metal Gear Solid (including the VR/Special missions), Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. However, it also includes Metal Gear (both the NES and MSX versions), Snake’s Revenge, and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.
Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Second Story is getting an HD-2D overhaul that slaps the letter R at the end of the title, a nod to the fact that it’s a remake.
The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.
Star Ocean The Second Story R launches November 2 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.


The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.

More specifically, the Arkham Trilogy is due out this fall and promises to allow players to experience "the definitive versions of Rocksteady's Arkham Trilogy games." This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more. All three of these games have been available elsewhere for years but this trilogy marks the first time Switch players can play through all three games. 
Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal. However, the three games in this trilogy are still great, so it's still a good get for the Switch platform.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
