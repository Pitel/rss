For one, it's set in a science fiction  world in which post-apocalyptic South Korea, the 10th century Byzantine Empire, and a 23rd century future are all somehow colliding. For two, it was revealed yesterday not with a brief logo or a show-nothing cinematic trailer, but with a nine minute video comprehensively depicting the actual game. Watch it below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NieR gets ready to breach and clear
The NieR series has crossed over into the worlds of PUBG, Soulcalibur, and Final Fantasy XIV. And now, NieR also joins the cameo ranks of Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege.
Ubisoft revealed today that a NieR cosmetic bundle is making its way into Rainbow Six Siege, arriving on November 21. The bundle isn't the only one on the way, either. A stinger at the end teases more to come, with 2B's boots and this tagline: "A YoRHa soldier is approaching... Glory to mankind!"
Looks like we'll learn more on November 21, when Ubisoft reveals the entirety of its next season, Operation Solar Raid. There, according to Ubisoft, we'll get more "NieR goodness" for Siege.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D13DlspkIvE
NieR and dear to our heart
The bundle shown off today is for Maverick, an Attack operator with a blowtorch. The set looks like it includes a cosmetic skin based off the brother Nier's appearance, rather than Papa Nier. I do like the design of the guns, as it's reminiscent of the black-and-gold aesthetic of the Shades. Grimoire Weiss is included in the bundle too, seemingly as a weapon charm.
As I mentioned before, this is hardly the first NieR crossover. Both the original NieR and NieR: Automata have crossed over into other games. In some cases, like Final Fantasy XIV's raid series, they even contain some additional details for fans.
I doubt Rainbow Six Siege will hold any deep lore tidbits, but I can't rule it out. It's a goofy and enjoyable crossover though, and one that made me fondly reminisce on series director Yoko Taro's response in our latest interview with him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major capital investment already secured
Sharon Tal Yguado, a media executive who has formerly worked for companies Amazon and FOX on a variety of smash-hit network shows, has announced the opening of new game development studio Astrid Entertainment.
The remotely-operated studio is yet to announce its workforce, but has seemingly already entered pre-production on its first release — believed to be a multiplayer-centric title. Tal Yguado has already successfully secured a "seven-figure pre-seed investment" from a party of powerful investors including Netease, Tower 26, and Stardom Ventures, which will be used to get Astrid Entertainment off to something of a major headstart.
"I love developing rich worlds and watching millions of people engage and build communities around them. We are seeing a new generation that wants something different. They enjoy walking into evocative worlds that give them freedom, let them hang out with their friends, explore, discover and create their own stories," said Tal Yguado in a press statement.
"I am incredibly lucky to have found and partnered with like-minded visionary game developers who are already pushing boundaries in this medium. We can’t wait to announce our incredibly talented gaming leadership team. Soon!"
Tal Yguado, who has previously been named one of the three most influential media executives in Hollywood, has worked a plethora of roles in televisual entertainment, partnering with various networks and having a hand in the production of shows such as The Walking Dead, The Boys, Invincible, Fleabag, Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and The Lord of Rings: Rings of Power.

The amusingly titled "Deep Dive" video, (running just short of four minutes), focuses on the many adventurous aspects of Forspoken that are both directly entwined with the game's central narrative or appear as fun little extras and/or mini-games. The video starts off with Athia's magnificent Monuments which, once freed of corruption by Frey, will offer up stat-boosting skills and abilities for …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How’s it hanging?
Trailers, screenshots, and previews of A Little to the Left paint a picture of a tidying game about making things neat – and a cat interferes and cats are nice. That’s not inaccurate, but there’s a lot more going on in Max Inferno’s first game. Presenting you with one-screen scenes of real-life objects like books, batteries, and cleaning products, the game invites you to get organising. The simplest asks are to just make a drawer neat, or straighten some pictures, but it soon becomes more sophisticated, launching into magical realist daydreams of how shadows and stars might be arranged to satisfy some sort of imagined rule set.
And it’s the imaginary nature of the rules that surprises most. Re-assembling a torn picture has a clear and obvious objective, for instance, but what is the right way to line up some pencils? Shortest to longest? Yellowest to purplest? Pointiest to bluntest? There’s no one right answer, so the game will usually accept whatever is your personal intuition – then shock you with the fact that there were other ways of seeing what seemed certain.

Microsoft has debuted its new Xbox Transparency Report, a bi-annual public document designed to detail all of the black-and-green brand's actions in regard to community enforcement, player complaints, banned and suspended accounts, and all other manner of recorded dirty dealings on the Xbox platform.
"With this inaugural Xbox Transparency Report, it is our goal to share with you more about the wide range of actions that the Xbox team takes to moderate content on our platform and create safer experiences," opens the report. "As an essential part of our growth, we expect this report to evolve over time as we learn, iterate, incorporate feedback, and make improvements."

A new hero joins the lineup of Marvel's Avengers at the end of the month. Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, will arrive in Marvel's Avengers on November 29.
The 2.7 update will add the once-frozen warrior to Avengers as a playable hero, alongside the Cloning Lab Omega-Level Threat. Bucky will also have his own chain of missions, which will reward an iconic outfit once completed.
The Winter Soldier will be voiced by Scott Porter, who also lent his voice to Bucky in Lego Marvel's Avengers. As for his playstyle, he's apparently an "assault-focused hero" who loves to do damage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDBojdBAjXU
The Omega-Level Threat of the Cloning Lab carries on the MODOK storyline. It's an endgame encounter meant for a squad of players to tackle, and will require Power Level 175 to enter.
Avengers, assembling
Bucky is the latest hero to join Marvel's Avengers, since Jane Foster's Thor took the field earlier this year. That brings the total hero count up to 12, if counting the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man.
It's also been a strange year for Crystal Dynamics, the team behind Marvel's Avengers. The studio was recently bought by Embracer Group, alongside Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal. The latter would soon be renamed to Onoma before getting shut down.
Meanwhile, Marvel's Avengers is still carrying on. The team says that updates past 2.7 will keep on revising and tuning heroes, as they've been doing with past patches. And Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next installment in the Tomb Raider franchise, too.

Games market research group Newzoo has published its latest report which forecasts a year-on-year decline of 4.3% for the global games market in 2022, following two years of "exceptional" growth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the report (thanks, GamesIndustryBiz), the firm estimates that the entire video game market will generate $184.4 billion in 2022, a reduction on the $196.8 billion forecast Newzoo made earlier in the year.

Player First Games has completed the first season of its crossover scrapper MultiVersus, with the free-to-play fighter making quite a splash in its opening months.

Xbox has detailed the latter part of November's Xbox Game Pass lineup, and it's got some intriguing additions. Wars for spice, fights for survival, and historical mystery are all headed to the subscription service before the month's out.
Leading the back-half of November are two entries out today, Somerville and Pentiment. The former is an Inside-like sci-fi thriller, while the latter is an excellent historical fiction mystery from the crew at Obsidian. I highly recommend making time for it this month.
The Game Preview version of Dune: Spice Wars rolls onto PC Game Pass on November 17. The 4X strategy game set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe is one way to get your maneuvering and strategizing fix.

Pikachu and Gengar are the only two 'mons confirmed to be making the jump to round, cuddly, and incredibly soft form so far, nor do we have a price for them yet, but listings should be appearing on the online Pokémon Center stores in the near future.

Marvel's Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that's far from all the heroes we'll be able to take control of when it's all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.

Publisher Thunderful Games has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire British independent studio Jumpship. The acquisition makes Jumpship the 10th studio to join the Thunderful portfolio, and the first purchase since the establishment of new CEO Anders Maiqvist.
“The level of intrigue that Jumpship has managed to generate for its debut title shows you that this is a team with a deep artistic vision," writes Thunderful Games' Agostino Simonetta in a press release. "Adding to our already diverse and accomplished roster of talent under the Thunderful Studios’ umbrella is an important part of our strategy to build strong internal IPs. We look forward to supporting the team at Jumpship to harness their skill for building impactful narrative-driven experiences as they continue to create fantastic titles within the Thunderful family."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_lPMatv07o
Founded in 2017 by Chris Olson and PlayDead co-founder Dino Patti, Jumpship's first release, Somerville, launches today on November 15 and concerns a young family's encounter with an intergalactic invasion. Much like previous PlayDead hits Limbo and Inside, Somerville sports a heavy atmospheric slant, evocative and stylistic visuals, and light platform and puzzle-based challenges.
Dino Patti also spoke of their excitement and confidence in the Thunderful acquisition.
"I feel really good about the partnership with Thunderful and what it will do for Jumpship," said Patti. "I have known Agostino for a very long time and we have built a strong relationship of trust. We’ve been talking about this possibility for around a year and, over that time, I have only become more convinced that this is a great opportunity for Jumpship and Thunderful alike."
Somerville launches today on Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass.

Isn't it terribly boring that so many ranked lists of Zelda games, whether it's "best music" or "best hairstyle for Link" or something else, end up dominated by Breath of the Wild? Well, not this one, because today we're ranking the very best dungeons in the Legend of Zelda series, and for once, BOTW doesn't have much to add (although it looks like Tears of the Kingdom might).
But rather than pointing out Breath of the Wild's dungeonlessness, let's instead celebrate the brilliant design, visuals, and music of our top 15 favourite dungeons over the past 35+ years, as well as the creative bosses, settings, and items that set those dungeons apart from all the rest.

I expect it was cheap in some kind of daily sale. Perhaps I was hungover, and hoped a small treat would ease my aching head. I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Season 1 of Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus is over, and Season 2 has begun today with an update that adds more reward tiers to the battle pass. There’s also a new Big Head Mode for the game’s recently added Silly Queue, and an in-game store that brings all MultiVersus’ skins and characters into one place for the first time. Weirdly, but appropriately, the game now keeps score of baskets on the Space Jam map and tracks how far away you shoot from too, so have some fun netting three-pointers with that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when I thought I had my top 10 games of 2022 sorted, Obsidian release Pentiment, forcing me to shred my former list and grab my quill and ink for a rewrite. It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. 
Its captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And runs through November 28 at 12PM ET
Bethesda has provided a new update on Fallout 76 happenings, and this time around, you'll get another event before the next big patch.
It's called the "Call to Axe-ion," and lets you pick up the Redd-Upper Auto-Axe skin on the Atomic Shop (free): and adds "unique daily and weekly challenges." While things are relatively quiet for now, the next big thing for Fallout 76 is still scheduled to arrive in December. That month will kick off season 11 of the season pass, as well as the "Nuka-World on Tour" update, which will ring in new public events, a region boss, and of course, more events.
For hardcore players, there's also some mechanical changes coming in regards to weapons:
"Although we are playing in a post-apocalyptic world, we still want to keep that world fair, fun, and inviting to all. While you have been exploring and rebuilding, we have been working on a new system that works behind the scenes to remove illegal attachment combinations that violate the EULA to ensure that every single player is using and trading the same items and has the same advantages as you. In today’s PTS update, we are implementing a system that will remove illegal mods attached to weapons that cannot be obtained in-game. Most players will not notice any change to their existing weapons, however, players who are in possession of a weapon with a mod that cannot be equipped naturally to the weapon may notice a damage decrease to the weapon, and the mod will no longer exist. This is intentional and does not need to be reported on the PTS Bug Reports channel in our Official Discord, but we encourage you to report anything unusual you observe outside of this change."

Here are the times when the Fallout 76 Axe-ion event starts and ends:
Event Start: 12:00 p.m. ET on November 15
Event End: 12:00 p.m. ET on November 28

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …]]></summary>

These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can't wait. However, there's still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we'll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it's Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…]]></summary>

Well, it turns out that it can be, and it has landed itself a Switch release date of 29th November, 2022 - as if there won't be enough football around at that point.

Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon's ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we'll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

Sonic Frontiers has been marinating for a bit, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a contextual success. While 3D Sonic games tend to be polarizing no matter what, many folks have taken to Frontiers, in part due to the promise of what this could bring for the future. Finally, I think Sega may have created a blueprint to follow for a really ace 3D Sonic game again (so naturally, they'll probably scrap everything and start over on the next go-around).
Until that happens, you can enjoy Frontiers a bit more thanks to some free DLC. In a collaboration with Capcom, Sonic is teaming up with the Monster Hunter series, complete with a new outfit and an extra minigame. It's not much, but if you're still playing through the core game (or going for a 100% rating), you can at least play around with the outfit. Note that you'll access it via the "extras" option in the main menu (before you load up a game).
Remember that this is in addition to the free SA2 shoes DLC, which is available to everyone until January. Hopefully there's more on the way! Crossovers are perfect for the Sonic series, especially other Sega properties.

That’s most likely because today sees the launch of American Truck Simulator’s Texas DLC, so you expect to hear more about Oklahoma after that's out of the way.

Fans of any and all genres will be interested to hear that Team17 and Rekka Games are bringing Bravery & Greed - the multiplayer, beat 'em up, roguelite, dungeon brawler - to Switch today with swords a-swinging and arrows a-flying.
We last heard of the title back at the Gamescom Future Games Show in August where we got to see a little bit of footage showing this fantasy world in action with the tentative release date of "Fall 2022". After a few months of relative silence on the matter, we now know not only that the game is coming soon, but it's coming really soon - today (15th November, 2022) at 5pm GMT / 6pm EST / 9am PST, to be precise.

Love it or hate it, there is no denying that the Grand Theft Auto series is huge. It is big enough to have GTA 6 subjected to leaks for months, big enough to have its iconic trilogy ported to Switch (in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition) with terrible effect last year and, it turns out, it was almost big enough to spawn its own Eminem-starring movie back in the early 2000s.
In a recent chat on the Bugzy Malone's Grandest Game podcast, Hollywood agent Kirk Ewing spoke about how he found himself in the middle of discussions between film producers and Rockstar Games on the potential of the GTA movie.

He told The Verge this in a new interview where he also revealed that no part of Microsoft's ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard is about pulling the rug from underneath PlayStation's plans; it's just that the two parties can't write a contract that says explicitly Call of Duty will be on PlayStation "forever." 
"It's not about at some point I pull the rug underneath PlayStation 7's legs, and it's 'ahaha you just didn't write the contract long enough,'" Spencer told The Verge. "There's no contract that could be written that says forever."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rolling the dice.
One of the only real criticisms we levelled at the recent Mega Man Battle & Fighters, a re-release of a Neo Geo Pocket Color title included in this new package, was that nobody had bothered to translate the content from Japanese. It was an issue exacerbated by a fan translation already existing online for those willing to go the emulation route. Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol.2, on the same basis, is equally disappointing.
There are ten titles on board this follow-up to Vol.1 — four of which are already available to buy separately on Switch eShop — nicely presented as little cartridges on the menu, each with a variety of options. The language barrier issue affects three titles, one of which is the aforementioned Mega Man Battle & Fighters. The other two are board game King of Fighters: Battle de Paradise, and minigame/sim curio Ganbare Neo Poke-Kun, both of which are fairly well-known to Neo Pocket aficionados as two of the system’s more intriguing titles.

Yesterday's announcement of the upcoming Splatoon 3 update, 'Chill Season 2022', might have caught many of us off guard, but there's no way that Nintendo is going to let any of the bonus content slip our minds. The detailed looks at the update began today with a walkthrough of what we can expect from the game's soon-to-be newest stage, Brinewater Springs.
There was a certain amount of location-specific content to be had in the Chill Season announcement, though we didn't get a look at the new map in this much detail. The stage looks to be set in an urban village home to some traditional architecture. There are also slopes and fountains a-plenty here, so the tactic will either be to find a good spot with a Charger up high, or take the dry spots of the arena by force with closer-range weapons.

This particular prototype build — unrelated to a later version that came to light earlier this year — is the E3 1997 demo and has been dumped and preserved after being supplied to the VGHF by an anonymous donor. Previously, off-screen showfloor footage was all that was available, but the game has now been archived for posterity, with the video above captured on real hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assume running position
Naruto fans have reason to raise their eyebrows (and arms) today, as a Bandai Namco trademark seemingly points to a new title in CyberConnect2 developed Ultimate Ninja Storm series.
As spotted by Gematsu, Bandai Namco filed a trademark just yesterday with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) for an "Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections" — a title that has yet to be announced or even hinted at by the publisher.
The series' most recent entry, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, launched way back in 2016, (although it did receive a Switch port in 2020), so it has been quite some time since Naruto and pals got their... erm... Ultimate Ninja on. The most recent Naruto title was 2018's Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Strikers, though some of the anime/manga series' spritely sluggers have since joined the roster of crossover characters in Epic Games' battle royale juggernaut Fortnite.
No doubt we will be hearing more news on this new Naruto trademark from Bandai Namco at some point in the near future. In the meantime, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is available now on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

We have known that golf was going to be swinging its way onto Nintendo Switch Sports at some point soon for a while now (ever since it was delayed to the holiday season in September's Nintendo Direct, to be precise), what we didn't know was exactly when it would be arriving.
According to a new Japanese advert for the game (found above), not only could golf be arriving sooner than expected, but it is coming later this month - for players in Japan, at least (thanks, Go Nintendo).

While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.
Somerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…]]></summary>

The free-to-play PvPvE survival shooter Scavengers is closing its doors. Studio Improbable confirms it will shut down Scavengers on December 16, 2022.
In an announcement, the team notes that it's been a while since its latest update. The reason for the closure looks to be a slowly dwindling player base for the shooter.
"The last few months have seen a decline in the playerbase, and whilst we explored many options to reinvigorate server population while the game is in early access, it became clear that it was unsustainable to continue development and live service," the statement reads. "We’re all proud of what we accomplished, and are grateful to every player who took the time to play, even if it was just for a short while."
The studio says it plans to celebrate the next few weeks, leading up to the shutdown.

A jagged, gorgeous winter
Shown off at the 2018 Game Awards, Scavengers was originally in development at Midwinter Entertainment. The team was bought by Improbable in 2019, and Scavengers launched into an early access in 2021.
In May, Improbable sold Midwinter to Behaviour Interactive, where the team is now working on an unannounced project. A small team was left to keep Scavengers running, while the console versions were scrapped. Improbable said in a statement at the time that the cut was to help the company's announced focus on the metaverse.
It's a shame to see for the remaining Scavengers fans. Hopefully those who held out hope will see something they like in Midwinter's new project at Behaviour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a real-life Fishbones!
Jinx was already one of the most well-loved and recognizable characters on the League of Legends roster, but after the release of Netflix's Arcane, her popularity has launched into the stratosphere. That kind of mainstream recognition usually means there are some awesome collabs on the way, which is definitely true in this case. This time around, Riot teamed up with Nerf to create a life-sized replica of Jinx's classic blaster known as Fishbones, which was also featured in Arcane, as fans will remember.
Jinx's Fishbones is available for pre-order now (pre-orders close January 1, 2023, and will be shipping on December 31, 2022. The gun is a gargantuan 35 inches long, and features jaws that open and close as you shoot. It holds 18 total darts, shooting out a three round burst every time you pull the trigger. Fishbones also comes with a Jinx-inspired stand and "display-worthy packaging" for those who want to show it off for everyone to see. The NERF LMTD League of Legends Jinx Fishbones blaster retails for $169.99, and is available for pre-order on Amazon or directly from Nerf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC_BXWllD5k
The Jinx Fishbones collaboration is part of NERF LMTD, a " premium, special edition, fan-focused line from the Nerf brand brings you some of the most iconic items from movies, video games, and entertainment with premium features and packaging." Other franchises that have been honored with a Nerf collab include Star Wars, Halo, Star Trek, Aliens, and G.I. Joe, just to name a few.
This has seriously got to be one of the coolest gaming merchandise crossovers I think I've ever seen, and absolutely something I wish I had when I was a kid. I've only touched League of Legends once in my life (that's a whole story for another day), but the second Nerf releases something from a game I play, I might just have to splurge and treat my inner child.

The Street Fighter community, yer boy included, remains on tenterhooks waiting for more information about Capcom's stellar-looking release Street Fighter 6 — In fact, some tinkerers are so eager for new action that they've taken to modding SF6 characters and skins directly into Street Fighter V!
The amusingly monikered modder "Sleepy Scrub" is currently mired in the process of adapting the skins of Street Fighter 6 for their Street Fighter V counterparts. Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Guile have already been completed, donning their slick SF6 looks, while Ken is  currently in development — though another modder, xHECZx, has seemingly beaten them to the (Dragon) punch.
No Juri yet... but I'm sure she's on deck.

Holding company Krafton has announced that it intends to acquire Swedish developer Neon Giant.
The South Korean umbrella corporation, which boasts battle royale juggernaut PUBG: Battlegrounds among its meaty portfolio, made the announcement as part of its third-quarter 2022 financial results. Neon Giant currently only has one notable title to its name — cyberpunk RPG The Ascent — but is currently developing an as-yet-unannounced first-person-shooter, set in an open-world environment.
Founded in the spring of 2018, Neon Giant was formatively made up of a party of former AAA game developers, featuring talent pulled from best-selling franchises such as DOOM, Gears of War, Far Cry, and Bulletstorm. Selected by Epic Games as one of several studios to receive a monetary grant for its first project, Neon Giant would develop and release The Ascent on PC and consoles in 2021, where it would receive moderate-to-high praise from critics and players.
With this latest acquisition, Neon Giant will join a number of western developers recently picked up by Krafton. Other purchases by the holding company include Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds and Striking Distance Studios, who are currently busy putting the finishing touches to their gory sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol.
The Ascent is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Nintendo has released a new demo for its madcap sports title Mario Strikers: Battle League, giving Switch owners the opportunity to check out the colorful and chaotic soccer game free of charge. The demo is available to download from the eShop now.
Nintendo had previously released a trial for Mario Strikers prior to the game's launch back in June of this year, but that particular demo was locked to Nintendo Online subscribers. While this new demo can be accessed by all Switch users, it is still limited to Nintendo's precious limitations. For starters, only one game of the Cup Battle feature can be played before the option is locked out. In addition, players can only experience the "Quick Match" feature seven times, before that too becomes inaccessible.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1590517271679508482?s=20&t=t-qXago3izz8rLojADoTSA
It's likely that Nintendo is hoping to get more footy fans on board, given the coming of the FIFA World Cup. But it's going to be a tough sell. While Mario Strikers: Battle League is a perfectly fine multiplayer title for anyone who wants a kickabout with pals, the full release has also been criticized for being very barebones, while also suffering from a distinct lack of major content drops/roster expansions since its initial launch. At $60, it's a hefty ask for a game that has been particularly subdued during its honeymoon period.
Still, if you and some pals fancy a bit of goofy footballing fun, then perhaps this new demo might help to win you over. At least you'll come away without any astro-burns, nor will you have to suffer some Big Lad blowing an air horn in your ear.

The Witcher is getting its update for newer consoles soon. The free next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has been locked in for December 14.
This update will be free for those who already own The Witcher 3, so no need to worry about buying it twice. While the next-gen part points to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, CD Projekt Red also confirms it will also arrive for PC players. A physical version is also in the works for a later date.
As for what's in the update? CD Projekt will be showcasing that next week, in a special REDstreams over on their Twitch channel. The showcase will have some details, as well as a gameplay reveal for the fancier version of this massive RPG adventure.

A shinier Wild Hunt
The next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a welcome end-of-year surprise. The project had been fairly quiet, as the spotlight had been mostly on other games like Cyberpunk 2077, which got its next-gen update earlier this year.
And I can't lie, I've been waiting for this update too. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was one of the better RPGs of the last generation, especially with its excellent pair of DLC stories. I was just holding out for an excuse to hop back in, and well, this is as good as any.
It's a good time for a Witcher refresher too, as the series has a lot on the horizon. While part of CD Projekt is working on Cyberpunk, another branch is developing the next trilogy in The Witcher series. The Molasses Flood is also working on its own Witcher project, and third-party studio Fool's Theory is developing a remake of The Witcher, the first game, in Unreal Engine 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Post-apocalyptic survival sim Forever Skies has floated its release date straight out of this year and into the first half of 2023, developers Far From Home have announced. Their reasons for the delay have been detailed in a lengthy Steam post, but it's mainly good news: after receiving tons of feedback from their recent demo, the devs are now looking to expand the game's scope and spend more time working on its futuristic dirigibles and such. They also released a new teaser trailer showing some customisable airships from the game, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shouldn't enjoy Sonic Frontiers as much as I do, but I do? The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it's a lot of fun when you're mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It's a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you'd like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can't get any better than this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big Run is imminent
A big update is coming to Splatoon 3 with some new features, including a certain Big Run. Today, Nintendo revealed a new trailer for the Chill Season of Splatoon 3.
The season kicks off on December 1, and adds a bunch of new content to the third squid-kid shooter entry. New stages are in store, some old and some new, as are new weapons. Three brand-new weapons (for Roller, Charger, and Shooter) are joined by 10 returning weapons from the Splatoon series.
For competitive players, the Chill Season of Splatoon 3 will see the return of X Battles. These are special ranked lobbies that you can only access once you've hit an elite rank in Anarchy Battles. Once there, you can risk special points to compete in these X Battles. It's like an extra level of ranked to compete in, for even higher bragging rights.

Born to Big Run
On the PvE side of things, the co-op Salmon Run mode is also seeing the debut of its Big Run mode. The Big Run has been teased in previous trailers, but it's a special in-game event that will bring the chaos of Salmon Run to a normal multiplayer map.
The first Big Run will kick off with the Chill Season of Splatoon 3 as Salmonids invade the Wahoo World stage. That's not very wahoo of them.
More info is on the way as to how this changes Splatsville, and how to play in this specific mode. But for the co-op fans, this seems like a big update, alongside what the competitive players are getting.
The Chill Season update will be available for all Splatoon 3 players with an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

Morio Kishimoto, designer and game director at Sonic Team, has suggested that the recent release Sonic Frontiers still has much room for improvement, noting that the developer will continue to work on the title now it is out in the hands of players worldwide.
In a pretty candid tweet posted Friday, (and translated by VGC), Kishimoto admitted that the new sequel features "areas where we are not quite there yet", and said that the development team would be taking player feedback seriously, "like a global playtest". Kishimoto notes that he envisions Sonic Frontiers becoming one of the series' most important titles, ultimately shaping the future of the long-running franchise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuTcBAkyNL4
Launching November 8 on PC and consoles, Sonic Frontiers has, like most of The Blue Blur's games, been a divisive title, running the gauntlet of high and low scores from both critics and players. While many have praised the high-speed sequel's visuals and mechanical overhaul, the title has been criticized by some for its combat, "boring" environments, and bizarre juxtaposition of colorful, cartoonish characters with somber, monolithic enemies.
Regardless, Sonic Frontiers has seen launch success. Over on the Steam platform, some 19,181 concurrent players were recorded at the game's launch, beating the previous series record — held by 2017's excellent throwback Sonic Mania. Whether Sonic Frontiers has the staying power to become the iconic release envisioned by Kishimoto remains to be seen, but this early admission that the title still has some way to go before developers will be pleased with the product does not go down smooth .
Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn't call him "Boy!", and also he won't shut up under any circumstances.

So Tactics Ogre: Reborn is out now on multiple platforms, including Switch. Thankfully, some folks (like solwhitehorn on Reddit) have tinkered around with it, and found that it has mouse and keyboard support: yep, on the Nintendo Switch!
That got me thinking: it would be great to have a list!
Which Switch games have mouse and keyboard support?
Tactics Ogre: Reborn
Doom 1 and 2
FUZE4
Hypnospace Outlaw
Factorio
Monster Hunter Rise (text input only)
Mouse and keyboard support has been a thing for generations of consoles now; and the most notable games I can think of that helped usher it into the mainstream spotlight were Phantasy Star Online for Xbox, and Shadowrun 2007 (the shooter). The latter was a really interesting experiment that pitted PC and Xbox players together via cross-play, ages before it became a major thing in the console market.
In any case, one of my favorite things about the Switch is the ability to swap to different control schemes. The Wii in particular was very inflexible, with many games forcing a singular type of control; and while the Wii U was better with a lot of titles allowing for Pro Controller support, the Switch has improved things even further.

At EyeLife's Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You'll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you'd prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you're not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.
Afterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They've got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you're short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don't forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I've only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful.

Real history is an interesting setting for games to use. Pulling in actual world events to tell a tale can be tricky, but Pentiment does it in stride.
Pentiment is a passion project from a small team of developers within Obsidian. It’s set in the tiny town of Tassing in Bavaria, in the late 15th and early 16th century. It’s a town with clear divides between the peasants and their fields, the townspeople’s crafted goods, and the double monastery looming just down the lane.
Every villager, sister, and monk in Tassing has a story. Each family has branches that grow out and interlock. It might seem too small a place to keep a secret. But as protagonist Andreas Maler soon discovers, those appearances are deceiving.

Even with, I’ll concede, some limits: whereas previous DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) versions have been available to any GeForce RTX graphics card, DLSS 3 is currently only usable on these RTX 40 series models. Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th. Yet having tested it out on the RTX 4090, I’m convinced it could be as big a deal as the cards themselves, especially if you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. 
Unfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[H2Whoaaaaa!
Ring the bell, sound the horns: the curtain has fallen on the Pokemon x Splatoon 3 splatfest — And now that the ink has finally dried and the result is in, we can see that Team Water has taken victory in the age-old battle of the Pokemon starter elements.
Over the past weekend, squid kids and octolings took to the messy battlefields of Splatoon 3 in order to stand up for their favorite starting Pokemon types — with playing taking up arms for Grass, Fire, and Water. Incredibly, Team Water came away with a perfect 45p score, meaning that the H2O lovin' squaddies ultimately won out in both Open and Pro battles, as well as winning the public vote.

This is one of the cleanest (no pun intended) sweeps in recent Splatoon history, and suggests that the Pokemon x Splatoon crossover community either really, really likes Water-type Pokemon, or that they simply converted their love of the wet stuff to fantastic in-game plays.
You can check out the full results below.
Public Vote
Team Grass: 25.80%
Team Fire: 33.60%
Team Water: 40.60%
Clout (Open)
Team Grass: 33.41%
Team Fire: 32.75%
Team Water: 33.84%
Clout (Pro)
Team Grass: 33.59%
Team Fire: 30.55%
Team Water: 35.86%
This special splatfest was, of course, held to help promote the release of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, both of which launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch on November 18. This event also represented the second splatfest result of the multiplayer shooter's new era. So, if your team took a drubbing this time around, it won't be too long before you can lock 'n' load for another weekend of gooey competition.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh Boy
Sony Santa Monica's long-anticipated release God of War Ragnarok finally hit shelves last week, and has already smashed all previous day-one sales in the long-running fantasy series — In fact, the first 24 hours of sales saw Ragnarok shift more copies than its 2018 predecessor achieved in its first week of release.
"God of War Ragnarok will debut at No.1 [in the UK Charts] and is the first cross-gen title in the series," said Gfk's Dorian Bloch in comments made to GamesIndustry.biz. "Day 1 physical sales were already greater than any other full-week launch sales for other titles in this franchise." Bloch also notes that 55% of PS5 hardware sales this past week consisted of God of War Ragnarok bundles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E
Launching on PS4 and PS5 on November 9, God of War Ragnarok sees a world-weary Kratos, accompanied by his fast-maturing son Atreus, embark upon another brutal odyssey across Scandinavia, preparing themselves for the coming of Ragnarok, the foretold event that will bring death to Gods and devastation to the land.
While some critics and fans have criticized the new sequel for its length and some frustrating "hand-holding" NPC dialogue, Ragnarok has received mass praise across the board for its spectacular visuals, compelling characters, engaging combat, and operatic approach to storytelling. Clearly more than worth the wait, Kratos and Atreus' latest head-chopping jaunt is clearly in contention for many critics and players' Game of the Year award, and is already set to be one of 2022's best-selling releases.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.

It’s a relief then, that Floodland is a bit more chill than some of its city-building contemporaries. Gone are the humanity-ending threats like Frostpunk’s great Winter storm, forever bearing down on you and periodically tightening its grasp around your neck. Here you have a simple group of stranded civilians looking to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flood.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 5000 series CPUs are getting increasingly affordable, with this week bringing rather good prices on the lowest-tier Ryzen 5 5500. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the cheapest Ryzen CPU in the lineup, but still quite a capable chip with power that's roughly equivalent to the old Ryzen 5 3600. This processor normally retails for £110, but today you can pick one up for £88 when you use code BAG20OFF.

Good morning, friends and witnesses, and welcome to this week's Whatcha Been Playing? May I start out by thanking everybody for their very, very kind birthday wishes last weekend. I had a pretty cool day, even if it was a little quieter than usual. I'm a busy fella, y'see? Still, I had a delicious donut and watched Sunset Boulevard for the 180th time, so it could have gone a whole lot worse. What really made it special, however, was the kindness shown to me here, in the Qposts, and on Twitter, so thank you.
I hope that your November has gotten off to a rollicking start, and as the year starts wheezing to its conclusion, I hope that November offers up some great memories — gaming or otherwise — to carry you into the coming holiday season. Go out and end this year with …]]></summary>

Publisher 3goo is currently gearing up for its rerelease of the cult 2D fighter The Rumble Fish 2 — Launching on PC and console platforms December 8, this release represents the 2005 scrapper's first-ever home appearance on the global market, filling in a long-standing gap for fight fans everywhere.
In order to get newcomers on board with the DIMPS fighter's weirdness, a new trailer spotlights the 13 characters that make up the roster — the titular "Rumble Fish (2)", as it were. These range from your standard bad-boy martial arts experts such as Zen, Lud, and Aran, to bizarre outliers such as child fighter Mito, young scribe Typhon, boxing shark dude Bazoo, and Cheeseburger in paradise-looking MF'er Boyd. Of course, sexy secret agent Sheryl is in the mix as the requisite waifu bait.
Check out the whole gang in the video below. See if you can spot your mains.

Limited Run Games currently has pre-orders open for physical editions of The Rumble Fish 2 on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch platforms. The fighter is available as a standard boxed edition for $34.99 USD, while a Collector's Edition, retailing for $64.99, includes an art book, strategy guide, command cards, a CD soundtrack, three additional DLC characters, plus a digital download for the first Rumble Fish release. Currently, this Collector's Edition is the only way to purchase the 2004 original.
The Rumble Fish 2 launches December 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Reminds me of being on some video game forum in the early noughties where a moderator absolutely flips their nut and everyone runs around pulling pranks and engaging in tomfoolery, then the bans start flowing. What a weird chaotic energy. Honestly, if there had been any hint of doubt around Elon Musk, he wouldn't have played such a prominent role in my cyberpunk novel about teens saving the world with NFTs. How could I have known, those six long months ago. Wow. Egg on my face. On all our faces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-11T18:47:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.]]></summary>

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
"Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday," Pershing writes. "He's been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans. He will be sorely missed not just by the cast of the series but by his legion of fans all over the world ... RIP, friend."

It’s set in Depression-era America, a time when many folks were having their assess kicked by the economy and manifest destiny. The game is about these people, specifically travellers and nomads who wander the country in search of answers. Migrant workers, preachers, poets, folk healers, Dustbowl refugees, and even men with wolf’s heads make up this cast, and it’s your job to meet these strangers and collect their stories.

Said anomaly fills with new sea creatures from all over the world every time it's visited, and possibly building-sized terror beasts and ancient merfolk, but Cobra's sure it'll all be fine, so in you go, mate. It's certainly pretty down there if nothing else, and Dave the Diver (game) is, if nothing else, a rare game that makes the usually tedious water level a bit of a treat to wander round in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in the pleasurable side of PC hardware. Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?
Oh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvestella is a JRPG. This may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say about a role-playing game from Square-Enix, but it’s the most important thing to know going in. Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.
Anyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.]]></summary>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's easy to place Dark Souls 2 in your crosshairs and take aim at its differences. Its map doesn't intertwine like Dark Souls 1 or 3. Lots of bosses do that thing where they summon in some mates and it's quite annoying. The atmosphere lacked that magic glaze. And yet, its quirks and frustrations make it one of my favourites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I toyed around with this intro a lot, because I didn’t want to start with a super pessimistic bang. But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.
At least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.

Out today on PC and Switch, it was originally developed by solo dev A Grumpy Fox as a small 30-day project, but it quickly ballooned into something larger. It's now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it's been time well spent.

While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It's impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.

There's a Cavern Of Lies to test Nate's coolness, and we check in with Henry "The Vit" Cavill, but first, of course, we must litigate the different kinds of cool we feel, what counts as cool, and which games make us feel the coolest.

That could always be the baggage plummeting from the sky over Anti-Escape Island though, where a summer vacation for the students of Escape Academy has gone very, very wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). 
Mostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder's Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good week for monitor deals, but a lot of what we've looked at has been fairly expensive, from a 42-inch LG OLED for £779 or a 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide for £943. These are great monitors, don't get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LG's C2 OLEDs are brilliant gaming displays at any size - and the 42-in and 48-in models are just small enough to fit onto an average to large-sized desk. That technically makes them "cool gaming monitors" and therefore well within my RPS deals duties. Both are now discounted from Crampton & Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon ("FLASH25") that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. 
That means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we've ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.

As you saw with our cover reveal yesterday, one of the most iconic characters is a centerpiece of Street Fighter 6's story. Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him "Hobo Ken." While at Capcom's headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…]]></summary>

For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

Stratton's post was written all the way back in May 2020, and Gordon's response is a doozy. “Marty lied about the circumstances surrounding the DOOM Eternal Soundtrack and used disinformation and innuendo to blame me entirely for its failure,” Gordon said in the post on Medium. Gordon claims that Stratton later offered a six-figure amount if he never spoke about the matter, but Gordon insists he turned the money down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

The intention to conduct an in-depth investigation was announced in a statement on the European Commission’s website, and will focus on how the deal will affect console and PC games, along with PC operating systems. This means that both the EU and UK are now holding further investigations into the potential buyout of Activision Blizzard due to concerns that Microsoft’s acquisition of the company could reduce competition within the games industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's Alienware AW3423DW is my favourite ultrawide monitor, thanks to its beautiful 34-inch QD-OLED screen that offers perfect blacks, near-instant pixel response times and gorgeous colours. With wide-screen 1440p (3440x1440) resolution and a 175Hz refresh rate, it's both detailed and responsive, and it looks the part too with a very cool space-y design. 
I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

There’s also a Google Stadia run of nautical indie action-adventure Wavetale, just a week before the streaming platform closes for good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other week I played a short demo for the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.
It's a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you're dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you're an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don't think that will change.

The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…]]></summary>

The shotgun blast of marketing speak erupted from the company’s third quarter earnings results for the year, setting off car alarms, shattering glass, and triggering journalists’ Google Alerts. You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window. I choose to sit on the fence for the next 12 months, carefully raising one eyebrow so I don’t topple over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How To Say Goodbye starts with someone dying. It’s not shocking or distressing; quite the opposite. The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. 
This is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn't received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway's NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.

A bit bland and archaic, lacking that colour and pop that the likes of Apex Legends and Valorant possess. But to pass it off as dull and basic is to do the game a disservice, as it's more refined than basically any of its competitors.

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …]]></summary>

The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons & Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game's release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that "enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. 
For more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. 
Which accessibility features do you find most helpful in games? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone," her statement reads. "Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering." 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, "creative vision" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”]]></summary>

Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with "H" and both their last names start with "K." Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…]]></summary>

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…]]></summary>

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…]]></summary>

As you can see, there's a lot going on in terms of graphics modes for this game, and that's great – the more options, the better! Regardless of where you play or how you play, it sounds like you're in for a good time based on the first five hours of the game. You can read what we thought about those first hours in our God of War Ragnarök spoiler-free impressions here.
