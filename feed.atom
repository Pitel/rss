        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live many lives
A short demo for the upcoming HD-2D remake of Live A Live is out on the Nintendo Switch eShop right now. And after spending a little bit of time with it, I'm pretty keen on playing the full game.
The demo was announced during yesterday's Nintendo Direct Mini Partner Showcase, allowing fans to get an early hands-on with the July 22nd release. The Live A Live demo also carries save progress over to the full game, so don't worry too much in that regard.
Still, even in demo form, the unique charms and ideas that have made Live A Live a sought-after port for ages really come across. Its demo has short slices of just three of its paths. But just playing them, Live A Live really feels like something Switch RPG fans need to keep an eye on.

Audio diaries — you'll find these little nuggets of storytelling scattered all over a game's world, taking the form of whatever diegetic theming fits best into the narrative. They can be called voxophones, audiographs, audio logs, or straight-up tape recorders, but it's always the same experience. You walk up to an object, interact with it, and you can hear characters talking to themselves, other characters, or even directly to the player themselves. We're going to call them audio diaries for simplicity's sake.
It's one of those mechanics that's in almost every single third- or first-person action game that has any semblance of narrative, and based on who I've talked to about audio diaries, they're a pretty polarizing mechanic at that. Some p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set to launch in 2023
It's hard to believe that Super Bomberman R, a flawed revival of the series, came out five whole years ago, but here we are. It was a Switch launch game even, and over a year later it made the jump to PC, PS4, and Xbox One.  After all these years Super Bomberman R 2 is now a thing, and it's going to launch on basically everything and ring in its own set of improvements.
So this time, Konami is eliminating any of the mystique of a timed exclusive platform. Although it technically debuted during the Nintendo Direct Mini presentation this week, Super Bomberman R 2 is actually arriving on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X devices in 2023.
The big additions for the Super Bomberman R sequel Konami is revealing so far include:
A "castle" battle mode where one person can challenge 15 other players with traps and support characters
A creation mode, which Konami says is "essentially a level editor," that also has a share feature for online play
In terms of what's coming back, the story mode is returning (with exploration sequences, base building, defense missions, and boss battles), as well as the 64-person battle royale mode, grand prix, and standard battle.
For me, the castle mode sounds the most intruiging. It's the kind of thing you'd make up as a kid playing Bomberman for the first time, but never actually get to play. You can watch it in action below, or at this timestamp in the new trailer (starting roughly 0:45 seconds in).

Camp Canyonwood is coming to Steam Early Access on August 4, and it'll task us with keeping campers in line, expanding the campground, and exploring mysteries in a Don't Starve-ish world. I'm intrigued.

The best part of the trailer is arguably the end, where it's confirmed that ghosts, UFOs, and other oddities are in the mix. And who's that ominous figure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little mouse, big adventures
The Spirit and the Mouse is an upcoming narrative puzzle platformer from Alblune Games, an indie team made up of two developers, Lucie Lescuyer and Alex Strook. Players will take on the role of a mouse named Lila who lives in a quaint French village, making friends with little electric spirit friends and helping out the local townspeople.
The game's trailer shows off the cozy setting, some of the characters that we'll meet, and of course, some gameplay segments of Lila running along rooftops and using electricity powers. The Spirit and the Mouse looks like one of those games that gives you plenty to do, but lets you go at your own pace and chill out, which is a perfect combination in my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5jpnShiiLs
I'll be interested to see what kind of narrative they have going on too, because we didn't get to see a lot of that from the trailer, but I have a feeling it's going to make me feel all warm and fuzzy (and not just because of the electricity). Another highlight from the trailer for me is definitely the music — I love an upbeat, jazzy score, so this might turn out to be one of those game soundtracks I have on a loop for a while.
I also never would have guessed just from looking at it that The Spirit and the Mouse was made by only two people. It looks great and well-polished — we'll have to see what it's like in practice when it comes out later this year. Alblune promises a wholesome, heartwarming experience with this one, and based on vibes alone, The Spirit and the Mouse feels like it might be in the same vein as the highly-anticipated Stray. Either way, we're always in need of more uplifting games out there.
The Spirit and the Mouse is set to electrify us sometime in 2022 on PC and Nintendo Switch, and a demo is available to play right now on Steam.

In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308733226112"></iframe>

<p>The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, "How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?" To which I responded, "Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now." Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the&nbsp;likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan&nbsp;–&nbsp;all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy&nbsp;babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their&nbsp;attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.</p>

<p>We're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is&nbsp;coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year.&nbsp;At the very least, a version will be&nbsp;translated into English for those looking to import.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Thank you for your support"
New figures from Square Enix claim that NieR: Automata sold 6.5 million units since launch, which was a staggering five-ish years ago.
The announcement comes from the game's official US Twitter account, as well as the Japanese Twitter arm. Both tweets thank fans for their support, while the Japanese one reminds us that the game came out five years ago somehow, and this past February was actually the fifth anniversary (周年) of its release.
Well, it looks like it's going to sell a little more, too, as the company just announced that NieR: Automata is coming to Switch later this year in October. This version will include prior DLC, as well as new outfits. At this point, you have a ton of Switch-only players who are going to bite, as well as double/triple-dippers.
To that end, that same account announced that there will be a five-year anniversary event held on November 25 and November 26 later in 2022. It'll take place at the Tokyo Garden Theater, and there's currently a lottery event so that folks can attend. There's a lot of NieR: Automata news popping up this week all of a sudden! It's always a pleasure to remember that this game exists, and it's still wild to me after all these years to see a NieR/Drakengard-adjacent game getting so much buzz.

The Direct rumours (sort of) came true, and we finally got a Nintendo Direct at the end of June — but wait, what's this? It's a "Mini" Direct? What does that mean?
Honestly, we're not fully sure what it means, but presumably Nintendo was trying to temper our expectations after a bombastic but Nintendo-light E3 Not-E3. Still, it was a jam-packed Direct, with a ton of JRPG news, a sprinkling of indies, and some much-awaited port announcements — but the question is, did you enjoy it? Was there something for everyone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paid gaming subscriptions to hit record high
Modern gaming subscriptions, such as PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Online, and Xbox Game Pass, continue to rake in millions of dollars each year and are currently set to hit a record number of subscribers by the end of 2022.
According to the number crunchers over at DFC Intelligence, revenue from paid subscription services is set to grow in the second half of the year — with money earned from each service's respective subscribers expected to offset what is predicted to be a weaker winter period for the industry. DFC predicts that roughly a third of the overall revenue for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox will come from subscription fees, rather than straight game sales.
It's difficult to argue against such predictions. The Xbox Game Pass service has all but reignited the Xbox brand in the aftermath of the somewhat submissive Xbox One years. Additionally, the recently revamped PlayStation Plus service is expected to see many users upgrade their standard subscription to the new "Extra" and "Premium" tiers, adding further free titles and access to a library of classic titles.
2022 — and the ninth generation in general — has been tentative for the industry, hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its major impact on the production and distribution of games, accessories, and hardware. Through subscription services, players have been able to receive instant access to a huge variety of new, recent, and old-school releases — for a relatively nominal fee. Much like Netflix and other paid streaming services changed the game for movies and television, gaming subscriptions are fast becoming a major component for our corner of the entertainment industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some fantastic songwriters are on board for this adventure
When Mario and the Rabbids hit the battlefield this October, they'll have some solid tracks backing them. During today's Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope showcase, Ubisoft unveiled three well-known composers crafting the tunes behind the battles.
Grant Kirkhope, the BAFTA-nominated composer, is back for the new Mario + Rabbids game. Joining him to contribute to the soundtrack are Gareth Coker and Yoko Shimomura.
Coker accrued many accolades and recognition for his work on the Ori series. Shimomura, meanwhile, is a legendary name in the world of video game music with credits on everything from Final Fight and Live a Live to Kingdom Hearts and, particularly relevant, the Mario & Luigi RPG series. This trio of composers could mean very, very good things for the tunes of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.

A tactical approach
Alongside what looks like a stellar lineup for the music, we also got a look at some more gameplay of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. It's still a tactical adventure, mixing action and platforming with a turn-based strategy system.
A few new faces are joining the fray, including the sword-wielding Rabbid Edge, the Rabbid version of Rosalina, and the big lizard himself: Bowser. Bowser was shown in yesterday's Nintendo Direct Mini, but today we got a little more of a look at him and his, uh, Bowzooka?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_NLXtKToHg
With a release date set for this October 20, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is entering a fairly busy fall. But this new adventure looks like a fun, interesting twist on the systems of the first. With even more composer star-power behind it, Sparks of Hope might be one for Switch owners to watch out for this fall.

There's a pretty long list of players who have beaten or tackled The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in weird and wonderful ways. Speedrunner Limcube is one of those people, and earlier this week, the streamer completed a pretty huge feat that could be a huge boon to speedrunners.
Limcube has managed to beat all 120 shrines in one sitting without using the Sheikah Slate's runes, and not only that, he did it all in one 28-hour stream (thanks, Eurogamer!). Beating every single shrine in one sitting would be incredible enough, but not using the runes — which many shrines specifically encourage that you use — makes the task ten times harder. Consider us majorly impressed.

The XIII remake has had a bit of a rough go of it, hasn't it? After launching on the PS4 back in 2020 to less than stellar reviews, with many even heading out to buy the original 2003 game instead, the Switch port received multiple delays. Today, however, Microids has announced that Switch owners will get their hands on this remake on 13th September — isn't that apt?
But to coincide with the Switch release, Microids has revealed that the studio has handed the reins over to Tower Five, creators of Lornsword Winter Chronicle. This developer has worked on the Switch port on top of adding online multiplayer, refining the art style to look closer to the original, and tweaking the AI among other things. Switch owners will be getting the best version of this remake on day one. But Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox players won't miss out either, as the game will receive all improvements in a free day one patch.

Honestly, I went into my hands-on slot expecting to plaster a big "meh" on the game in my notepad. But the inclusion of a "modern" control scheme flipped this on its head. I'm telling you, it's an absolute game changer.

As revealed in Nintendo's June 2022 Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is launching on Switch on 20th October. This afternoon, Ubisoft's dedicated showcase, a separate 15-minute stream from Nintendo's Direct Mini, has revealed various elements of the upcoming game, including new gameplay details (no grids!), characters (Bowser, Rabbit Rosalina, and the ever-mysterious green and purple Rabbid, Edge), and more information on the evil force trying to absorb the galaxy's energy, including that of the titular Sparks.

Watch: Mario + Rabbids Sparks Of Hope Showcase - Live!

Tough as it might be to believe, it's been nearly five years since Ubisoft and Nintendo released a crossover that seemed unlikely and — dare we say it — unnatural at the time. Multiverse crossovers are ten-a-penny these days, but rumours that Mario's Mushroom Kingdom crew would be collaborating with Ubisoft's love-'em-or-hate-'em Rabbids (anarchic bunnies which spawned from the Rayman series into a pre-Minions world) seemed crazy enough, but coming together in an XCOM-style turn-based strategy game that outfitted the cast with blasters? Surely not.

Blizzard is putting out a rather large Diablo II: Resurrected patch today, and it aims to address backend stuff to make the game smoother.

The Resurrected team admits that these elements weren't working as well as they should have, so you should see more games populated than before as of today when the patch is live. "Any number of games in your region that have a strong enough connection" are now visible, and the game list has been doubled from 20 to 40, with a real-time ticker/updates. Both consoles and PC players will see the benefits of this change.

This spin-off launched a whole new sub-franchise for the yellow puck on his 20th anniversary back in 1999, and fans have been desperate to see the game make a return. And now it will be this August!

First 4 Figures has made a pretty impressive name for itself thanks to its wide range of highly detailed and super-collectable statues and figurines, and the latest Zelda-related product has just dropped in the Nintendo Life office.
We've already sampled the delights of Link and Revali, and now it's the turn of one of the most iconic items in the entire Zelda universe: the signature Hylian shield which Link takes with him into battle. Outside of the Master Sword, this has to rank as one of the most essential objects in any Zelda outing; emblazoned with the Tri-Force and the Hylian crest, it has arguably become the trademark for the entire series.

One of the big headliners during the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase yesterday was Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, the sequel to Ubisoft's XCOM-esque Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. The original was a surprising mash-up of genres and characters that maybe shouldn't have worked, but darn, they worked really well together.
So we're delighted we're getting a sequel this year! And yesterday, we found out that the space-based game will be launching on the Switch on the 20th October along with some new details on the upcoming strategy sequel. But we're about to get more info today. As revealed yesterday, Ubisoft is having a special Showcase which promises to give us a better look at the unique tactical combat, as well as "a few surprises", so if you're a fan of the original, you won't want to miss this.

A My Nintendo Fire Emblem Warriors reward is coming soon, but don't get too excited! For 600 platinum you'll net a memo pad.
Announced by way of My Nintendo news, the reward will contain "full color images" of both versions of new protagonist Shez, as well as several key characters in the narrative (including members of the titular "three" houses). Typically it takes roughly 1-2 weeks for these rewards to go primetime.
Here's the full description from Nintendo:
"Jot down battle strategies, take notes, or simply doodle 'til you drop with this full-color memo pad themed after the new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes game for the Nintendo Switch system. Its pages feature stunning character art of new protagonist Shez (both male and female variants), Arval, Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude."

Currently the listing is not live. In fact, if you click on it, it'll bring you to this random printable Triangle Strategy box art cover page. But having followed rewards like this closely for some time, I wouldn't expect it to sell out instantly. In fact, several recent rewards like the Mario Strikers bag and the Switch Sports cooling towel are still up for grabs. Stranger things have happened in terms of items running out of stock, but this one should be fine within a 24-hour window of going live; at least.

There's no word on exactly which games will be included just yet, but we'll update this post when we hear more. It will apparently feature "six new titles inspired by the classics", though — see the blurb below for more details.

Developers Rogue Factor didn't provide many other details, besides a few buzz words: "semi-open world", "true adventure", "third person".
So, I sat down with the game's creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a "true adventure". Lo and behold, I think it worked!

Portal: Companion Collection has only just come out, but it seems a lot of interesting discoveries are already being made. Just earlier today, we reported on the existence of Half-Life 2 data within the game that's actually allowed some users to run the Valve classic on Switch hardware.
Now, it looks like never-before-seen Portal 2 beta content has been discovered for the first time within the Companion Collection's data. As reported by GamesRadar, YouTube user Ossy Flawol has uncovered a lot of interesting data, including cut levels, dev tools, and even an early version of the game's ending. A huge co-op level has also been discovered that features puzzles and mechanics that would eventually make their way into Portal 2's multiplayer component.

VentureBeat reports that the 100-strong team at Proletariat will be joining Blizzard and helping with the development of its titanic MMORPG World of Warcraft. Blizzard is looking to beef up its staffing numbers for the game as the developer approaches the MMO's next expansion coming later this year, Dragonflight.

This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.

      <p>With Atari's 50th anniversary happening this week, the company has revealed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. This classic compilation of games stretches beyond the standard game-collection bundles we've seen in the past, with aspirations of serving as a virtual, interactive museum to paint a picture of just how influential and important Atari was, particularly through the nascent years of the video game industry. I went hands-on with Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration to see how well it accomplishes that lofty goal.</p>

And not only that, it'll be coming to the hybrid console before anything else (other than PC, of course!).
However, after digging around a bit on the brand spanking new website for the game, Eurogamer reports that this may well be the last game in the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trailer is out now, the full thing arrives on June 27
In case you've been wondering why there's been some GoldenEye 64 news this year, note that it's the 25th anniversary of the series (amid rumors that it could be coming back in some capacity). That's partially why it's getting a whole GoldenEye 64 documentary!
Directed by documentarian Drew Roller, it'll bring us through the journey of the game "developer in a farmhouse in Warwickshire by a small ragtag team of university graduates, most of whom had never worked on a game before." Based on the trailer, the doc will take a look at how GoldenEye 64 (among several other games), changed the way shooters were perceived on consoles. There's interviews with past developers afoot, as well as tons of classic late '90s footage sprinkled in to take some of us back: or give younger folks a frame of reference for the "Xtreme/Attitude" period of the industry.
If you're interested, you can find the site for the production team here, which is where it'll debut in digital format on June 27. Although the digital platforms differ by region, it's currently being sold on iTunes [Apple TV] for roughly $9.99 USD, and the film clocks in at one hour and 39 minutes.
It's starting to get to the point where a lot of these retro games are "ancient history," and can be looked at in the same way that old relics of the past (like Pong) were just 20 years ago. I've come to accept it!
[Update: The documentary is out now. The digital platform options now include Prime Video, Sky, and Google Play in addition to Apple TV.]

During the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Valve announced that Portal: Companion Collection would release the very same day, giving Switch owners access to both Portal and Portal 2. Not even a full 24 hours after its release, however, it seems modders have discovered significant date related to Half-Life 2 within the game and have now managed to get it running on the Switch...

The upcoming Legend of Mana anime — Legend of Mana: The Teardrop Crystal — has received a brand new trailer earlier today (Thanks Comicbook and GoNintendo!). Produced by Graphinica (Chain Chronicle ~Light of Haecceitas~, Muv-Luv Alternative) and Yokohama Animation Lab (Monster Strike), the show looks pretty darn lovely so far.

After what felt like years of having to make do with just a single image to promote the launch of Sonic Origins, the game is finally in the hands of Switch owners. Pooling together the classic 2D Sonic titles, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic CD, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles, the game is a commendable compilation that newcomers in particular would do well to check out.

Disney's Mickey Mouse has been no stranger to video games over the years, from classic The Magical Quest and Illusion series to kart racers, and even Kingdom Hearts.

Perhaps one of the more notable and recent Mickey Mouse games is Epic Mickey, designed by Deus Ex creator Warren Spector. This Junction Point-Developed game got two sequels — Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two and the 3DS spin-off Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Available to Nintendo Switch Online members
Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can spend their extra Platinum Points on player icons, and this week, Nintendo added new avatars based on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Now we're talking! Since I last spoke about these wave-based profile pics, I've mostly tuned them out — but today is a big exception. Among other options, it's possible to set your Switch icon as the revolting (and amusingly censored) Dubious Food.
Link, Zelda, Urbosa, Revali, Tera, and a riled-up Bokoblin — the gang's all here. If you want to be prim and proper, the choice is yours. My eyes immediately darted elsewhere.
[caption id="attachment_332306" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Zelda: Breath of the Wild player icons are up for grabs until July 4 at 5:59 p.m. Pacific.[/caption]
If you're feeling bold, you'll drop 10 points on the Dubious Food and swap it in as your (permanent?) new Nintendo Switch player icon. Well, at least until the joke wears thin.
You can find the current selection from your Switch home screen — click on the red Switch Online icon, then scroll down to Missions & Rewards to see what's available.
This whole "weekly avatars" scheme is still pretty fresh, with tons of games and imagery to pull from, so I think it's amusing that Nintendo is willing to include some off-kilter imagery this early into the proceedings. If anything, the trick is just getting people to pay attention — I would've totally missed the Dubious Food if not for a Reddit shout-out.
After appearing in Breath of the Wild and Age of Calamity, I'll be bummed if this so-called food doesn't return for the sequel. I hope it's even more of a wildcard next time around.

There were a bunch of third-party games shown in today's Nintendo Direct Mini Partner Showcase, but one in particular threw me at first glance. Captain Velvet Meteor: The Jump+ Dimensions is an upcoming tactical RPG that leans into guests from the Shonen Jump+ catalog.
The new tactics game from Momo-Pi Game Studio and Shueisha Games follows Damien, a boy who's just moved to Japan. Feeling lonely in his new home, he dives into his imagination as the superhero Captain Velvet Meteor.
Along the way, he imagines a roster of his favorite Jump+ characters filling his adventures. It's an interesting premise, emphasized by the presence of actual famous faces from the Shonen Jump+ lineup.

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is free-to-play now, for close to a week. Over the last weekend, I spent hours getting back in; acclimating to the new model, browsing the new rewards, and marveling at all that's changed since I dropped off. And despite some early wrinkles, I can't really deny it. It's a good time to be back into Fall Guys.
It's almost impossible for me to divorce Fall Guys from the moment when it launched. It was the first summer of the pandemic, and with everyone inside and socially distanced, Fall Guys was a welcome reprieve. Much like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, it became a forum for social interaction. But that's not to say Fall Guys wasn't good on its own merits, either.

There are a lot of video games out there in the world.

Various developers and studios have given us some truly amazing entries in all of these genres and many more, but sometimes, I find myself wondering if there's anything new out there that will shake up the industry. Of course, this is always a silly thought, because people are endlessly creative, especially when it comes to game design. The industry has plenty of answers for keeping things moving forward, but my absolute favorite trend in games right now is genre mashup.

Ever since Capcom released Street Fighter II 30 years ago, the fighting game genre has attempted to strive for perfection. Oh sure, the methods, modes, mechanics, and artistic styles for every ring-rocker are very different, but every one of these games is pushing toward the same goal: the capture of a community; a passionate player base that will keep said fighter alive, kicking, and perpetually on its feet, lest it falls to a 10-count like so many contenders that have come before.
Today, it is incredibly rare that a developer makes a "bad fighter." Whether billion-dollar franchises such as Tekken, Mortal Kombat, and Street Fighter itself, to mid-size slugfests such as The King of Fighters, Guilty Gear, and Skullgirls, to cultish outliers such as Melty Blood, Samurai Shodown…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avast ye, the first trailer for Return to Monkey Island is finally here!
The Monkey Island games are heralded as some of the best point-and-click games ever made, so fans are pretty thrilled to be getting another mainline game twelve years after the series' last release, which was a special edition of the first two games. Another sequel is long overdue, and thankfully the developers behind the project, Terrible Toybox, just released a new trailer to satiate us as we wait for the game to drop later this year. The trailer was also posted by Monkey Island's beloved designer and creator Ron Gilbert, who shared the news with the exact type of humor we'd expect from him.
The new trailer shows off Return to Monkey Island's revamped art style, which captures the quirkiness of the characters and world perfectly. Although we didn't get to see all that much of it, the gameplay itself looks like the classic Monkey Island experience we know and love. Story-wise, our plucky protagonist Guybrush Threepwood promises we're in for an adventure with "ships, fights, love, treasure, betrayal, and root beer." As an avid lover of all things pirate-related myself, I don't think there's much more I could really ask for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3mxq44HhnU
I can be pretty hesitant about sequels this far out from the originals, especially when a series' legacy is on the line, but I have to say that I've been blown away by everything I've seen of Return to Monkey Island so far. It also says a lot that they have some of the original creators involved. At this point, I'm optimistic that the game will bring a thrilling adventure from a classic series to a brand new audience.
Return to Monkey Island takes to the high seas sometime in 2022 for PC and Nintendo Switch.

When esoteric publisher Microids announced that we were getting five Smurfs games in as many years, we all laughed, then we cried a little, then laughed more to alleviate the pain. But it seems that we all had a lot of growing up to do, as Microids has channeled that bemusement into sadistic determination.
Following up the fall 2021 release of platform adventure The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf, the French publisher has now moved on to that second video game genre detailed in the Big Book of IP Licensing: Kart Racing. Smurfs Kart will see the little blue buggers taking to the rural raceway in a selection of rickety-looking wooden karts, loaded for bear with special items and unique abilities.
Players can choose from The Main One, The One With The Chef's Hat, The Old One, Smurfette, or The Others. (Kinda 'sus that I only know Smurfette by name, frankly), before hitting a series of woodland tracks in what is sure to be the bog-standard Mario Kart template that has been previously adopted by The Simpsons, Wacky Races, Garfield, Family Guy, Shrek, Angry Birds, LEGO, Nicktoons, Hello Kitty, Woody Woodpecker, Danger Mouse, and fucking M&Ms.
Honestly, once Sonic and Sega All-Star Racing Transformed was released, we already had a grandstand champion. Still, now we've done platformer and kart racing, we have no choice but to go to the obligatory next stage: Smurfs Wrestling.
Smurfs Kart is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. It is expected to launch this winter.

Today's Nintendo Direct Mini video introduces the main setting of Sonic Frontiers, the Starfall Islands, and shows off the Cyber Space levels starting at the 0:45 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Catch Some Rays
There's another reason for shmup fans to get their trigger fingers in gear today, as the legendary arcade developer Taito and ShotTrigger makers M2 have announced a brand new compilation, Ray'z Arcade Chronology, which will compile the button-pounding titles of the cult shmup series, "Ray."
Currently in development for PS4 and Nintendo Switch, Ray'z Arcade Chronology will contain four classic Ray releases. Featured in the compilation are the original RayForce (1994), sequels RayStorm (1996) and RayCrisis (1998), as well as a revamped version of 2013 remaster RayStorm HD, complete with brand new features. The chronology will be rounded out with a brand new remaster of RayCrisis — titled RayCrisis HD — so fans will be able to enjoy a brand new take on the franchise along with the aforementioned hits.

Unfortunately, that's where the info ends, with nary a release date or trailer to be seen, (though Taito Japan has opened a brand new website for the collection).
M2 have been done fantastic work in ensuring that the history of the shmup genre has been collated, archived and/or rereleased for modern audiences, and this upcoming collection will only add to the burgeoning catalog of coin-op classics.
Taito is yet to announce a western localization for the compilation, but we'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information is forthcoming.
Ray'Z Arcade Chronology is in development for PS4 and Switch, with a launch window of 2023.

Following up on its recent promise to increase the production and distribution of its Steam Deck hardware, developer Valve has announced that it is on track to double the number of consoles currently headed to its eagerly-waiting army of pre-order customers.
Speaking on Twitter, Valve noted that customers in the "Q2" reservation bracket should have already received their confirmation email, with Q3 confirmation emails expected to arrive in the coming fortnight. Customers should think fast, however, as they only have three days to confirm and pay for their chosen model, which will lock in their order and see their lil' black box begin the journey to their front door. Those still waiting on their email can check the status of their order at the Steam Deck store.
Valve's Steam Deck has proven to be yet another victim of electronic component shortages. Ever since the global COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted international production and shipment industries, manufacturers have struggled to meet their initial targets for hardware rollout. The delays that currently affect the Steam Deck platform have also affected the production and distribution of consoles such as Sony's PS5, Xbox's Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, as well as graphics cards for PCs and tech markets outside of the gaming sphere.
The Steam Deck officially launched in March 2022, and currently supports well over 2000 titles.

      <p>Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that&nbsp;creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.</p>

<p>Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is&nbsp;another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new view of the post-apocalypse is on the way
Fallout London, a massive "DLC-sized" mod for Fallout 4, has a new trailer and a release window. The huge fan-made expansion is set to arrive next year, in 2023.
The trailer, which premiered over the weekend, showcases the sights and sounds of London in the post-nuclear apocalypse of Fallout. Though there's ruins and destruction abound, you can still make out plenty of landmarks and vistas you'd expect to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzGG-eImQ_Q
Fallout London is billed as a continuation of base Fallout 4. The setting is a pretty drastic jump as Fallout has never really ventured outside the U.S. for its locales. The team says tackling the London setting allows them to explore cultures that have not homogenized with the American wasteland, as well as explore the effects of the Resource Wars on pre-war Britain.
A new wasteland
We've seen some gameplay of this massive mod before, but it looks like the dev team has at least a decent inkling of when Fallout London will see the light of day. And even though Fallout and other Bethesda RPGs have a history of massive mods, this one has some particularly intriguing elements.
The boat and canals look really interesting. The obvious London theming feels like a good, healthy departure and exciting environment to explore. And at one point, at the very end of the trailer, I swear I saw a battle elephant. An honest-to-goodness, Lord of the Rings-style war elephant. Seems like London gets wild in the nuclear future.
Since it seems like it will be a very, very long time before Bethesda ever circles back around to the Fallout franchise, Fallout London seems like a decent hope for those looking for a fresh take. The massive Fallout 4 mod is planned to arrive sometime in 2023.

Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.</p>

<p>In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of&nbsp;Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.</p>

<p>Gotham Knights is <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2022/06/20/new-details-on-alternate-suits-missions-and-the-elseworlds-like-cooperative-play" target="_blank">looking great</a> after the last <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/10/nightwing-and-red-hood-featured-in-new-gotham-knights-gameplay-preorders-now-available" target="_blank">couple of trailers</a>, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take&nbsp;on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Over the last 31 years, the Sonic the Hedgehog fan base has dashed through several distinct eras. The Classic Era let fans platform through brilliantly designed 2D stages, while the Modern Era gave us the Adventure games and Boost games, and that's not even counting the Sonic Boom titles. Now, with the movies setting box office records and reinserting everyone's favorite blue hedgehog back into the mainstream consciousness, a new era for Sonic the Hedgehog games could very well be upon us. With Sonic Frontiers, Sega and Sonic Team could hope to welcome fans to …]]></summary>

      <p>Sonic Frontiers’ “open zone” format has been the centerpiece of discussion, and for a good reason. Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels&nbsp;compliment Frontiers' exploration-…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix takes you to the Rune Factory
A new farming game is coming to town this fall. Square Enix's Harvestella is the company's take on the farming life sim RPG, arriving November 4 for PC (via Steam) and Nintendo Switch.
Shown today during the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Harvestella is a new RPG from Square Enix that mixes farming, socializing, and RPG action into one big pot.
It immediately gives off some Rune Factory vibes, as it seems to have a similar mix of combat and farming. But it's also got some interesting twists on the formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yd3tzhN99E
While there are four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—there's also a season of death called Quietus. During this time, crops wither and lethal dust keeps the denizens of the world indoors.
Planning harvests will have to accommodate for this bizarre mystery, and it looks like a major drive will be figuring out why the Quietus is happening.
A bountiful harvest
Of course, there's both crop harvesting and livestock raising. Harvestella has many of the familiar farming trappings. It also has combat and an overworld to explore, though, which is where the Rune Factory comparison starts to feel more apt.
The Square Enix blog dives into more detail, noting a job system that will let the player character specialize in certain combat forms. Be a Fighter and dive right into the fray. Or play a Mage, and launch magic from afar. The overworld has new characters to meet, dungeons to explore, and even a submarine.

More and more companies have been trying their hand at a farming life sim. (A Disney-themed one was even in this showcase, too.) What Square Enix has with Harvestella seems pretty darn interesting. A game with all the expected features like farming, fighting, and socializing plus some RPG goodness in the mysteries of the world? Sign me up.
Harvestella arrives for Nintendo Switch and PC on Nov. 4, 2022.

      <p>After years of the fan base begging Atlus to bring its mainline Persona games to Switch, the publisher finally satisfies that request. Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2022/06/15/update-persona-5-coming-to-xbox-this-october-persona-4-and-3-hit-playstation-and">the announcement of Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC</a>, Atlus announced during today's Nintendo Direct Mini presentation that the three upgraded versions of its beloved Persona games will also arrive on Nintendo Switch.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2022/02/09/the-portal-games-are-coming-to-switch">previously announced Portal: Companion Collection</a> gathers the two acclaimed first-person puzzle games into one bundle for Switch. While we already knew it was coming sometime this year, today's Nintendo Direct Mini presentation news revealed&nbsp;that we'll be able to play two of the greatest puzzle games of all time on Switch beginning today.</p>

<p>Portal was&nbsp;released in 2007 as a part of The Orange Box, a bundle that gathered Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.</p>

<p>Both Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Square Enix has pulled back the curtains on Dragon Quest Treasures, a new spin-off entry in the legendary Dragon Quest franchise that was first teased in May 2021. This game focuses on the childhoods of Mia and Erik, two siblings from Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. As these two characters, players embark on hunts for treasure in Draconia&nbsp;before the events of Dragon Quest XI.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_i3MlZfCAQ" width=""></iframe>

<p>As Mia and Erik travel through Draconia, they can recruit monsters to locate loot, explore the world, and fight enemies. Your recruited monsters are more helpful than just battling, it turns out: Using Slimes, you can bounce up to higher ledges, while grabbing onto a Dracky while you're exploring can allow you to glide like Breath of the Wild's paraglider. Once you complete your treasure hunt and obtain your prize, you can bring it back to your base to see how much it's worth. Using the funds you obtain from your hunts, you can improve your base and increase your treasure hunting level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dragon Quest Treasures launches on December 9 for Switch.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Live A Live is just over three weeks from release, but Nintendo and Square Enix are ready to rev the hype engine. During today's Nintendo Direct Mini, we received an update on the exciting, beautiful&nbsp;HD2D title that remakes the 1994 Super Famicom RPG that never came to Western markets. However, the big news from the presentation is that if you want to see what the buzz&nbsp;is all about, you can get a taste starting today.</p>

<p>The game puts you in the roles of multiple stories and multiple protagonists across different eras. The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect. Not only that but the save data transfers to the full game if you decide to buy it; it's always nice to know your time in a demo is productive when it comes to the final release.</p>

<p>Live A Live comes to Switch on July 22.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Bandai Namco has announced a new remake of Pac-Man World called Pac-Man World: Re-Pac. This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308641949112"></iframe>

<p>Pac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world's final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1,&nbsp;<em>Game Informer</em> liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.</p>

<p>This is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier's classic catalog.</p>

<p>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>When the first Mega Man Legacy Collection&nbsp;launched in 2015, players hoped there was more to follow. Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308642740112"></iframe>

<p>Today, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it's been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection.&nbsp;Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mega Man&nbsp;Battle Network</li>
	<li>Mega Man Battle Network 2</li>
	<li>Mega Man Battle Network 3 White</li>
	<li>Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue</li>
	<li>Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun</li>
	<li>Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon</li>
	<li>Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman</li>
	<li>Mega Man&nbsp;Battle Network 5 Team Colonel</li>
	<li>Mega Man&nbsp;Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar</li>
	<li>Mega Man&nbsp;Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar</li>
</ul>

<p>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is slated for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC and&nbsp;launches in 2023.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the&nbsp;game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308644683112"></iframe>

<p>In the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.</p>

<p>When the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/super_bomberman_r/b/switch/archive/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-game-informer-review.aspx">heavily criticized it</a> for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I'm hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

      <p>One of the most requested titles is finally coming to Switch later this year. Nier: Automata quickly found a large fan base when it launched in 2017, with many praising the storytelling, action, and soundtrack of the Platinum Games-developed title. Now, more than five years later, the heartfelt story of 2B and 9S comes to Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Nier:&nbsp;Automata&nbsp;The End of Yorha Edition includes previously released content and new costumes that will be available at launch. We don't know much else about what appears to be an "ultimate" or "game of the year" edition of the title, but the game's inclusion in the Switch library&nbsp;is noteworthy. When Nier: Automata launched in 2017, it received critical and fan acclaim, with the PlayStation 4 version garnering an 88 out of 100 score on reviews aggregate website Metacritic.</p>

<p>Nier: Automata&nbsp;The End of Yorha Edition arrives on Nintendo Switch on October 6.

      <p>Nintendo kicked off its Direct Mini presentation today with a new trailer for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding&nbsp;new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle. However, Capcom isn't stopping there, as the new trailer gave way to a roadmap of free title updates for players over the next several months.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308640580112"></iframe>

<p>The first title update hits in August, adding Seething Bazelgeuse, Lucent Nargacuga, and several other monsters. That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters. Finally, Capcom says a fourth free title update will arrive in 2023, but it isn't ready to say anything about what to expect with that one.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available June 30&nbsp;on Switch and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also in Steam Deck news, Valve’s Lawrence Yang – a designer who worked on the on the handheld PC – has weighed in on a widely shared mod that replaces the pre-installed SSD with a larger, faster model. His advice: don’t do it.


The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

      <p>Hearthstone is taking a trip to the Shadowlands&nbsp;for a fancy dinner party hosted by the definitely-not-nefarious Sire Denathrius. "Hosted" is appropriate in the past tense&nbsp;because someone has <em>murdered</em> the now-former leader of Revendreth and the Venthyr. Now there's a soiree full of suspects and locations to investigate to find out who did the dirty deed in Murder at Castle Nathria.</p>

      <p>During its annual Spark 2022 conference, Tencent Games unveiled&nbsp;Code: To Jin Yong, a new open-world action title steeped in wuxia literature and created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>The upcoming game comes from LightSpeed Studio, a Chinese team most notable for developing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/04/19/respawn-announces-apex-legends-mobile">Apex Legends Mobile</a> and PUBG Mobile. Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts)&nbsp;novels by&nbsp;acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose&nbsp;works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is more of a niche prospect than its upscaler cousin DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), though it shares the same ultimate goal of making your PC games look sharper. Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

Lots of things with no end, basically. It's also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon's core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it's fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.

      It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzar…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I'm honest. Even the ones I've enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren't the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it's precisely because it's not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It's not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it's all the more faithful for that.

      <p>Along with the debut of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/21/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-is-coming-to-steam-this-week" target="_blank">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands on Steam</a> this week, a brand new DLC has landed for the Bunkers &amp; Badasses-themed shooter. You can check out the trailer for Molten Mirrors below.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308461898112"></iframe>

<p>Those who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there's plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that&nbsp;will surely put players' abilities at dipping and dodging to the test.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn't free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I'm willing to bet that "pluviophile" would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you're doing. It's time to frolick. No umbrella required.

What I wasn't expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game's reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let's investigate.

The authorities blocked or shut down 226 websites and 461 piracy apps, while making several arrests. The Justice Department reports that, for the first time, anti-piracy efforts were also carried out in the 'metaverse'; although it's unclear what that means exactly.

Now Sonic creator and Sonic 3 programmer Yuji Naka has seemed to lend credence to that legend on Twitter, as it relates to the replacement of certain tracks in the recently released remasters in Sonic Origins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell "Requiem". The second is 'What would it be like if you had the power of rats?'. The third is, 'What if rats had any power to have?'. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called 'What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn't delayed until next year?'.

      <p>Crystal Dynamics announced in April that Marvel's Avengers' next hero would be <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/19/jane-foster-is-the-next-playable-hero-in-marvels-avengers" target="_blank">Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor</a>. A new <a href="https://avengers.square-enix-games.com/en-us/news/wtw-week-95/?utm_source=twitter_playavengers&amp;utm_campaign=wtw95_blog_SQEXSOCIAL" target="_blank">War Table blog post</a> names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.</p>

<p>Mark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane's powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans' appetite for the&nbsp;character's Norse-powered return in the upcoming <em>Thor: Love &amp; Thunder</em>, which hits theaters on July 8.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane's moveset from Thor's. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time&nbsp;as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that's something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>A Plague Tale: Requiem finally arrives on October 18, Focus Entertainment announced today during a special broadcast. The release confirmation comes alongside an extended gameplay showing that follows Amicia and Hugo as they attempt to escape&nbsp;an enemy-laden quarry.</p>

<p>You can watch the new demo below to get an in-game look at a slice of the game’s story, as the siblings are pursued by soldiers. This leads to a good showing of the game's stealth as the pair sneak around the quarry. Amicia also gets her hands dirty taking out enemies in a showcase of the game's action.&nbsp;</p>

Beyond that, Nightdive's remastering has made Westwood's 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you'd be better off with GOG's ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

      <p>The Biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monstrous antagonists, are as mysterious as they are deadly. To understand the design process behind the Biophage and the game’s copious amounts of gore, we spoke with Striking Distance’s Character Director Glauco Longhi to learn how the studio created nightmares it hopes will terrify players. </p>

<p>Longhi tells us the Biophage was born out of the studio’s philosophical desire to create enemies grounded in reality while also applying their own creativity. He even cites realism as one of his personal pillars of what makes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as "complicated" or "simple". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

Don't worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there's going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited.

      <p><strong>Update:</strong> Yuji Naka has, kind of, walked back his original, unintentional confirmation that Michael Jackson worked on Sonic 3 after years of vaguely proven&nbsp;speculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the original story, posted below, he seemingly expressed disappointment that some of Sonic 3's music has been swapped out in Sonic Origins due to Jackson's connection to it.&nbsp;In a follow-up tweet, he posted: "I feel like I'm being misunderstood a lot, probably because I don't speak English and I'm using a translation tool. Sorry."</p>

Set in that most dodgy of times, the future, Hyenas is about pilfering relics of pop culture such as Pez dispensers, Mega Drives and Sonic The Hedgehog paraphernalia before tech billionaires who’ve colonised Mars can furnish their homes with it all. You can be bemused at your own leisure by watching the trailer below.

It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters.

      <p>Sega's&nbsp;Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team&nbsp;heist&nbsp;experience set in space with a punky comic book&nbsp;aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and "engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory." The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself,&nbsp;you can check out the trailer below.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308341635112"></iframe>

<p>The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.</p>

<p>The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QjB7dWWhro" target="_blank"><em>IGN</em>'s Summer of Gaming</a> interview-filled stream.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

The game soft-launched with a pre-season on June 8th, so its transition into the first season seems to consist largely of the launch of its Fortuna battle pass. Here’s a trailer detailing what the pass entails, below.

It's not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

Many of the questions seek information to help improve the platform but others raise a few concerns. Users are invited to confess to being pirates, say whether they are heavy users of pirate sites, and then name the pirate sites they use the most. Savvy business move or something more sinister?

Right now, you can pick up a Nitro 5 laptop with an RTX 3080 graphics card, Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 1TB NVMe SSD and 1080p 360Hz screen for just £1499 at Ebuyer - a nearly £400 reduction from its original UK RRP.

These fans come in black without RGB for a stealthy look, can be daisy-chained to make cable management easier and can be controlled via PWM from 200 to 1800RPM. In terms of performance, every review I've found mentions their great value, but they also detail whisper-quiet performance at low RPMs.

So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.
Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I've left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

Still, the Steam Next Fest is underway, with so many great demos to try out if you can maintain your corporeal form this weekend. So what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not E3 2022 is over. It's done. I think? I mean there's a Nacon showcase in July but, I mean come on now, we can't start classing events that occur outside of June as being part of the event formerly known as E3 can we? That would be preposterous. Before long it would spool out across the entire year, absorbing every month until E3 is a constant series of video events that could happen at any point. Do you want to live in a world where Geoff Keighley
 is allowed to drop a World Premiere at 4PM on Christmas Day? It doesn't bear thinking about, really, does it.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220605/"/>
        <updated>2022-06-05T09:55:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
