        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-electric-field-safe-in-stalker-2/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=how-to-unlock-the-electric-field-safe-in-stalker-2"/>
        <updated>2024-11-23T07:53:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Electric Field safe is one of the many hidden chests you'll come across in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. However, it's perhaps one of the hardest safes to unlock if you have to determine the code on your own.


This particular chest can be found in Garbage, so you'll have to play a bit to gain access. While you can travel to the location at any given time, it's better to concentrate on the main campaign missions. Once you've reached Slag Heap, you can start trying to unlock the chest.


Stalker 2 Electric Field safe code


To reach the stash located in the safe, you can travel to the location marked on the map. The stash can be found upstairs, and you'll need a four-digit code to reach it in the first place. Type in the following code - 1708 on the keycode machine to reach the safe.


In case you're wondering about how I reached the solution, it's related to the description of the place. When you open the stash on your map, it has the following description.


Image via Destructoid


"It's a good hiding place. I'm surprised the electronics are still functional. Hopefully they still are... anyway, the code is stick, cobra, porthole, infinity."


The last four words, which appear as something completely random, are your clues. Each of them represents a numeric digit that looks like the words (not identical, but there will be a close resemblance).



Stick - 1


Cobra - 7


Porthole - 0


Infinity - 8



In that order, the code required to open the Electric Field safe is 1708. Sadly, this is one of those stashes you might just give a skip. After opening the stash, you'll get meds, ammo, food, and grenades. They're useful for sure, but not worth a separate hassle. If you're about to pass over the location as part of some question, make sure to give the location a visit to get the free loot.

Others, like Ziggurat and SNEG, keep older games updated and functional on newer operating systems. Good Old Games has always done that to an extent, but now they’re making a greater commitment with the GOG Preservation Program.


In essence, the program simply means that GOG’s staff has checked into a game and ensured that it runs fine. As they put it, they are essentially taking over ongoing support from the original developer. For some games, such as the Resident Evil series, untangling some of the bugs in the original Windows version can take a lot of effort.

When it comes to the main quests in Stalker 2, you can expect them to have different endings (something that I love), and the King of the Hill requires you to find the leader of Slag Heap. Finding the quest isn't very hard as you can't avoid it at any cost. To receive the mission, you'll have to interact with Diode (the Tech of Slag Heap).

How to start Belle's Enchanted Day in Disney Dreamlight Valley


You can start the Belle's Enchanted Day quest by picking up a Mysterious Page in the Bind. It'll be right underneath a bridge, around the same place as Merida's first quest.

Picking up the piece of paper triggers the mission, requiring you to give it to Beast. Quest-related characters typically spawn in the new Storybook Vale map, so he shouldn't be too far from your location.

Not only can you wear any basic rings that you can find, you can also combine rings to create what I like to call “Extra rings”, which combine the effects of both of the rings used to make them. This allows you to stack buffs and cater your rings to your needs.

This fodder challenge has been released as part of the FC Pro Live promo. Phizin is one of the several esports pros taking part in the upcoming FC Pro Open, and you can complete a simple SBC to obtain some valuable rewards. The SBC itself will reward you with a bonus pack, and it's necessary to complete an additional objective set as well.

Additionally, completing this challenge will earn you more rewards from the FC Pro Puzzle Completionist objective. You'll get a 80+ x2 Rare Players Pack by completing this SBC, and the full set features 500 SP and one 84+ x2 Rare Gold Players Pack.

That's a good thing. It's been five years since Shenmue III launched, and it's currently only available for users on PlayStation 4 and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. With ININ taking the reigns, we can assume the publisher plans to bring Shenmue III to many more platforms, such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and maybe even Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and mobile. 





Will Ryo Hazuki's journey continue?

Before you can get animals on your farm in Fields of Mistria, you’ll need to repair both the Bridge and the Mill. Repairing the Bridge is the first task set for you by Adeline and happens fairly early on. Then, once that’s done, you’ll get a letter from Adeline in the mail after the Spring Festival in your first year. Visiting her in her office will spark the quest to repair the Mill, and when that’s done, you can move on to get some animals.

Where to find Mushroom Caps in Towers of Aghasba


Mushroom Caps grow almost exclusively in Temperate Ecosystems, meaning you generally won't find them much outside of one. That isn't to say you can't find them randomly scattered, but they are certainly few and far between and not really a viable option if you need them in abundance. The easiest way to obtain Mushroom Caps is to grow them yourself within a Temperate Ecosystem. Thankfully, the main storyline of Towers of Aghasba shows you how to g…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Monolith AR416 is a wonderful assault rifle that can do immense damage to all forms of enemies, and you can obtain it if you've purchased the Digital/Ultimate Edition of Stalker 2.


The bonus content includes special suits and weapons spread all over The Zone. To gather them, you'll have to solve a side mission to uncover the Journalist Stashes. Once discovered, you'll be able to find this assault rifle and much more by simply exploring the different regions inside The Zone.


Stalker 2 Monolith AR416 assault rifle location explained


This gun can be found inside a Journalist Stash, but the location can be extremely dangerous. It's better to start your journey by finding the Mercenary's Suit, which is located in the settlement of Zalissya. To get the Monolith assault rifle, you'll need to travel to the IPSF base.


The stash is located right where the little icon is shown on the map. It's on top of a roof with protruding pipes. Do note that you'll be open to enemy fire, as the region is part of the main quest. You'll have to enter The Sphere to interrogate Solder, and there will be guards patrolling the region.

First, take out the guards on the ground from outside the gate. It's best to enter by following the road rather than going in from the front. Next, go up the watchtower to take down the guard there. You can also loot a mini stash on the watch tower to get some resources.


Get down from the tower and proceed to the location. Get on the top of the roof from the side, and you'll be able to find the Monolith AR416. You'll also get some ammo for the gun from the same stash but try to conserve them. The specific ammo required for the Monolith assault rifle isn't widely available at the location, so it's better to rely on other weapons to dispose of the remaining guards.

Level-5 returned to the West in a big way earlier this year with the release of Megaton Musashi W: Wired. Eight months on, the mech battler is landing a beefy new patch, with the 'Megarobo Batroseum' update scheduled to come to Switch on 26th November.
As detailed in the new trailer (above) the headline addition of this one is a new online PvP mode — fittingly called 'Megarobo Batroseum' — where you'll select a mech from a limited number of pre-sets and get right into a battle. You can either invite friends or hop into a room with other fighters based on your match rule preferences. Nice.

One of my favorite ways to do that, I've found, is to play games while listening to a podcast, show, or some music at the same time. Do I need to bombard myself with stimuli to shut my brain up so I can breathe for a minute? Who's to say, but I do know that I think it's a lot of fun.
At this point, I feel like something of a gaming-while-also-listening-to-a-podcast connoisseur, and I've tried out a whole bunch of different titles so you don't have to. Without further ado, here is my list of the best games to play while you're also listening to something else.

This Vampire Survivors update comes with over 20 new weapons, a couple of new passives, and a whole lot more.


To unlock the new weapons, you'll basically need to unlock the characters, which we have a separate guide for. Each character comes with a weapon, and you usually unlock that weapon for other characters by surviving with the original owner for a set amount of time. You can find these specific conditions in the Unlocks section of the game.

        <updated>2024-11-22T17:05:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To put it mildly, the team at GSC Game World has been through an exceptionally difficult time trying to complete STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Chief among these was the studio getting caught up in the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022.


However, they came through it in the end, and it seems to be paying off. STALKER 2 has officially sold a million copies already, according to a post on GSC's X account. This is despite the fact it only launched a couple of days ago. But then again, it's one many have been waiting for.




The developer has thanked all players (Stalkers) who have bought and are continuing to play, something that's been diligently worked on these past few years. It's not just hype either, it seems. Over on Steam, Heart of Chornobyl is currently showing a review score of Very Positive.


The work never ends


Of course, it's still early days, and although much of the feedback is singing the game's praises, there are some issues that need to be worked out. Fans are expressing concerns about some of the bugs that are present in Stalker 2. No doubt, these will be addressed in a future update. Give them time, guys!


It is also worth noting that, according to the most recent data from SteamDB, over 117,000 people have been playing within the last 24 hours. That, and it's currently sitting pretty on the Steam Top Sellers list, where it's beating Star Wars: Outlaws at the time of writing. If you ever needed proof that people have been waiting a long time for this game, this is it.


STALKER 2 has been in development for a good while now, with GSC originally announcing it in 2010. The series has enjoyed success as a cult classic, and looking at the figures so far, it stands to reason that this latest installment could shoot the franchise into the mainstream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

However, not everyone is aware that this DLC has always been time-limited. As disclosed in its original announcement trailer, Dave the Diver's Godzilla DLC is only going to be available until November 23, 2024. After that date, it's seemingly going to disappear completely from online stores.

We've been keeping an eye on Amber Isle, the Animal Crossing-meets-dinosaurs life sim from developer Ambertail Games, for a while now. This one was initially supposed to land on Switch in late October before getting a last-minute delay to November. Well, the developer has now announced yet another delay, with the planned release date shifting to February 2025.
A delay like this is never something that we like to see happen, but in the accompanying statement, the developer claimed that the Switch version isn't currently up to scratch: "the island needs a little more prep time before we're ready to open our ports and have you all come ashore". Hey, we'd always rather see a delay than a bug-filled release.

A new update is available now for Yakuza Kiwami on the Nintendo Switch, and although it's not a particularly beefy one, it will no doubt prove welcome for players of the newly-released port.
In short, it offers up "some performance improvements". Yeah, that's it! We're not sure exactly what kind of improvements have been included, but general feedback from players so far is that the frame rate seems a lot more stable across the board. To be honest, the game already runs remarkably well for the Nintendo Switch, so for it to have been improved even further is very appreciated, indeed.

The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

Surprisingly, they didn't get a single God pack (a pack filled with rare cards). What's perhaps most unfortunate about all of this though is that there's supposedly "no reward" at the end of it.

Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing".

Believe it or not, it's now 20 years since Nintendo launched the DS.
Rather than getting caught up in where the last two decades disappeared to, we thought it was worth looking back at our personal top five games for a system with a staggering amount of superb software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake? And how can its best settings be anointed if some, particularly FSR 3 frame generation, simply don’t work as they should?

Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved 'pirate' set-top devices from functioning in people's homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, "there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use," the hacker predicted.

Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash.

With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let's take a closer look at how things play out.

Besides, isn't every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn't have RPG-style elements. No wait, don't actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.

We've got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of "machine learning" technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it'll devour as you play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I've never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot 'em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: "ah, that was good."
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

But also because they want all the tasty games owned by them too, such as the Danganronpa series, the Octopath Traveler games, and the biggest corn flake of them all, the Dark Souls series.

It's like the "glass half empty" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the "bar", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. "A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please," I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha "prelude": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of "hateful or extremist" language and images hosted on Steam's community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts.

True, games like Invisigun have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it's framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A "nevíme jak" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…]]></summary>

This is surely the best link this week: an hour-long video on how to beat "every possible game of Pokemon Platinum at the same time". That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously. It's an impressive feat, but the video itself is great too, patiently breaking down the process with motion graphics and video editing flair. Delightful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four thousand words of notes. Hoboy. Field of Glory Colon Kingdoms is definitely thought-provoking.
It was also complaint-provoking in the fairly long period where I didn't understand what it's trying to do. Reaching that point, luckily for you, means we can cut out a lot of the "confused whingeing" subsection of those notes. Though it still has its shortcomings, I've come to appreciate that I was reading Kingdoms all wrong. Although it talks big about characters, politics, and religion, they're not what it's about. It's about building.

It's part of a "restructuring" that'll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in a press release yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it's an intentional move that'll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers.

At this point it's clear that they can either choose Nintendo, or Switch emulators, but they can't have relationships with both. At least not in public. During the last few hours Nintendo began targeting Pomelo, a popular Switch emulator for iOS devices. Like similar emulators before it, Pomelo's disclaimer against piracy is redundant. Thanks to its family tree, it has nowhere left to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been 'out' of strategy autobattler Mechabellum since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back in September. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as "a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry We're Closed is a retro survival horror-inspired game about escaping the clutches of an excessively horny demon who desperately wants your heart. As someone who isn't often into the 'lore' behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say "lol, it me" with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter "ugh, it me" and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap "should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it." But do you?

And you'll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I've found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BREIN has obtained a new blocking order in the Netherlands targeting TorrentGalaxy, one the world's most popular torrent sites.  Internet provider Odido objected to the request, arguing that the Dutch anti-piracy group could have done more to target the problem closer to the source. The Rotterdam District Court found that the anti-piracy group can't be expected to do more than it's already done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the strategy of Sultan’s Game for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its Steam demo - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been "you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?", because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as "co-developers" on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

The latest claim accuses Google of ignoring notices that aim to remove pirate IPTV providers from search results. So here's the thing: why would a company take down 10 billion URLs from search but suddenly start acting differently? The public labeling of Google as "grossly negligent" deserves context too; two weeks ago, Google's diligence prevented one of its accusers from deindexing its own website.

"I didn’t even know what a Neo-Volkite pistol was until five minutes ago, but now this whole game is trash until I get one!." As promised in the roadmap, the last big update added a whole new Operations map, complete with a gargantuan new pseudo-boss in the form of a hierophant bio-titan. It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED – which is like a Steam Deck but better in almost every way – is getting a new, if potentially more smudge-susceptible Limited Edition. A successor to the translucent version that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several major record labels are asking the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a rehearing en banc in their piracy lawsuit against Grande Communications. They argue that the court erred in holding that piracy damages should be calculated per album, rather than per song. They argue that this decision, which will lower the $47 million damages award, doesn't reflect the way that music is commercialized today.

I’ve stopped a small community from completing a blood ritual, played the role of matchmaker to a group of lonely hearts that involved organising a date with god, and plastered a statue with paint as part of a revolutionary movement to uplift the power of art. My time with GGG has been a pick n’ mix of colourful escapades, and together with its story of godly woes, striking art style, vacuum-based puzzle-solving, and nightmare-inducing puppet work, I’m now a die-hard LimboLane devotee.

But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel's development back in 2004. Rolling Stone interviewed two key designers of the game and made a fun discovery. The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children's book about a nice elephant.

"This" has changed a lot over time: from producing CD and DVD coverdiscs, to writing for a magazine, to editing magazines and a website, to solely editing a website, to managing several websites. Sprinkle podcasts, videos, events and a lot of other things in there and "games journalist" doesn't really cover it. 

One of the only constants is that I read a lot of writing about video games. 

Dapper gent Oli Welsh wrote for Polygon about the fan reboot of City Of Heroes. We briefly covered fans getting an official license earlier this year, but Oli went and spoke to the folks making it all work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In all honesty, Toads Of The Bayou could have been several notches less ribbet-ing than its Steam demo ended up being, because its stylised pixel fly-snatchers are just that good. There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amplitude Studios, developers of many a game with "Endless" in the name, have split with publisher Sega to become independent again, with ownership of the studio reverting to its original founders and "other members of the team". The developers say everyone is parting "on good terms" and that the last eight years of getting published under Sega has been "amazing". But there are other businessy reasons, of course. Namely, Sega have been trying to trim down their European studios for the past year, and Amplitude is just the latest bunch of devs affected by that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could tower defence be the ultimate "it's Friday and I am here in body only" genre? I haven't really thought about it before, but Rift Riff's effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

"Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel.

"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Méně erudovaný divák si může říkat, že jde o vydařenou, profesionálně natočenou, nepřístupnou sexy komedii, která je místy (hlavně ke konci) dost divná a nějak skřípe. Více erudovaný divák si může říkat, že to je odvážná hra s žánry a možná dokonce i nastavování zrcadel něčemu. Každopádně je to originální zážitek, který skoro nenudí a vypadá až překvapivě výpravně (vzhledem k omezenému rozpočtu). (Ilča 100 %)]]></summary>
