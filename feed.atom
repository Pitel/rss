When it was revealed Nintendo's latest hardware revision for the Switch would feature an OLED screen, concerns were immediately raised about the possibility of screen burn-in.
Although this type of display has come quite far since the days of the PlayStation Vita, the risk of burn-in is still a thing. Fortunately, since the launch of the Switch OLED model, we haven't really heard about any horror stories, so is it actually something to be concerned about?

Fortunately, Nintendo might finally be readying itself to reveal a new entry - with claims from industry analyst Dr. Serkan Toto earlier this week that "Mario Kart 9" is now in "active development", and could be teased at some point in 2022. As usual, the latest game is expected to come with a "new twist" and that last part is what's sent the internet and social media into overdrive.

I've had ears and eyes long enough to know that people were upset about the ending of Mass Effect 3 however, even after BioWare tweaked it. The original Mass Effect 3 had various "Happy Ending Mods" to change the close of Commander Shepard's story, and now Mass Effect Legendary Edition does, too.

Towards the end of last year, GungHo Online Entertainment announced a brand new anime series for Ninjala. This one is said to be "more involved" than the previous YouTube cartoon series that already aired, and the plan is to "dive deeper into the game's colorful world".
GOE has now locked in the release date for the first episode's launch date, and it will air next week on 13th January on the official Ninjala YouTube channel. Each episode will be available to everyone around the globe every Thursday, but the catch is they'll only be around for a week at a time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie's smaller experimental entry in the series, Halo 3: ODST.
Halo 3: ODST was released on the Xbox 360 on September 22, 2009, and was intended to be a smaller project designed by a skunkworks team. However, the development of ODST has roots in Peter Jackson's aborted attempt to make a Halo film/game. For the next hour, we talk about ODST's relatively short development time, why the title changed from Halo 3: Recon, the innovative Firefight multiplayer mode, and Bungie's push to spin out from under Microsoft and become its own company again.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game to not feature Master Chief.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.
Check out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub. If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

The first week of 2022 has passed, and it was relatively quiet as everyone settled back into their routines. That said there were still some interesting bits and bobs, such as the revelation that producing the grass was a bit of a pain for the Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity team. Elsewhere we had Metacritic listing Nintendo's highest rated games of 2021, A PlayStation store in China recruiting Mario and Bowser to the cause, and someone performed an Undertale track for the Pope. Yeah, it'll be a weird year, but at least it's looking like a terrific 12 months for gaming on Switch.
Anyhoo, it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

This year's AGDQ is in support of the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and will take place from Sunday, 9th January through to Sunday, 16th January. Following on from Summer Games Done Quick's record $2.9 million raised for Doctors Without Borders, AGDQ will feature a massive list of speedruns over the course of a week in an attempt to inch closer to that $3 million mark.

Longawaited entries finally debuted with Shin Megami Tensei V and Neo: The World Ends With You. And that’s only scratching the surface.

That is, if you can get your hands on them, err, feet in them. Converse’s Pokémon collection went live today and it features 22 different things to buy ranging from adult shoes to children’s shoes to shirts, hats, and more. And to be honest, all of it looks great.
Right now, a quick stroll through the collection page will reveal that the Converse x Pokémon First Partners Chuck Taylor All-Star shoes, Converse x Pokémon Poké Ball Chuck Taylor All Star shoes, and the Converse x Pokémon Pikachu Chuck Taylor All Star Easy-On shoes are sold out. 
The Converse x Pokémon Pikachu Crewneck T-Shirt, Converse x Pokémon Team Long Sleeve T-Shirt, and Converse x Pokémon Patch Long Sleeve T-Shirt are sold out as well. However, there’s still plenty of stylish Converse x Pokémon merch up on the site available to buy. Here’s a look at some of the shoes you can purchase:

Twitch Plays Pokémon has a lot to answer for. What began with a goofy experiment to see if the hivemind could actually play an old game has blossomed into an entire genre of gameplay: Playing Pokémon in weird ways, the latest of which is Pokémon inside of a Twitter avatar. If things keep going this way, we'll be playing Pokémon on a network of fungi by 2030.
Constantin Liétard, the Montreal-based creator of Pokémon Red-inside-a-Twitter-avatar, has just announced that his latest project, Pokémon Crystal-inside-a-Twitter-avatar, is now ready to play. At the time of writing, the player character is just about to pick their first starter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The King of Fighters XV is coming close to having a complete roster, with the frosty fighter Kula Diamond becoming the 38th member. 
Kula and her ice-centric moves were revealed in a new trailer this week. Formerly a member of Team K' in past King of Fighters installments, she's joined the tournament with newcomer Krohnen (who's mechanically a callback to the popular Akira-inspired KOF character K9999) and Ángel, a former NESTS assassin with a pro wrestling move set.

It would have been quite the shock if a fan-favorite face like Kula didn't make the main roster of KOFXV, but since she's the 38th character revealed from a confirmed roster of 39, other mainstays like Taekwondo practitioner Kim may have to wait for DLC or miss out entirely. There are rumors as to who the final character will end up being, but what we do know is there's only one spot on a team open, and it's alongside Ash Crimson and Kukri. 
The King of Fighters XV is scheduled for release on February 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who preorder it digitally can start fighting a few days sooner with an early access period that begins on February 14.]]></summary>

This new gameplay lore trailer—yeesh!—explains why a game set within Tom Clancy's serious world of paranoid jingoistic masturbation is overrun with a weird parasite mutating people into monsters.

It's a new year — one with loads of 2s in it, whatever that means — and that means getting ready for a whole lot of things to look forward to. We've already covered 30 games that we're excited for in 2022, but there are so many more than fly under the radar: Indie games! So, why not shine our spotlight on some of the smaller-but-brilliant games coming to the Nintendo Switch this year?
Of course, we won't be repeating any of the games that made it to our big 30 — that means that you won't find Windjammers 2, OlliOlli World, Card Shark, Outer Wilds, Sports Story, Oxenfree II, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, Metal Slug Tactics, River City Girls 2, or Hollow Knight: Silksong here. Instead, we hope you'll find some games you didn't even know about before — we certainly did!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Bend Studio director Jeff Ross recently revealed that he pitched an open-world Resistance sequel after Sony made it clear it had no interest in a Days Gone 2. There were also talks of a new Syphon Filter reboot. But none of these projects made it very far, according to Ross in a new interview with David Jaffe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone revealed last August that a new South Park game is in the works alongside “several spinoff movies” and more, and now, we know what studio is developing that title. 
Revealed on a Careers web page, Question Games, the team behind The Magic Circle and The Blackout Club, is working on a new South Park game and a job listing might hint at multiplayer. The listing also reveals that the game will be developed in Unreal Engine with an aim to release on “modern systems” such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

“Question and South Park Digital Studios are seeking a Lead Level Designer for work on a new video game set in the world of South Park,” the Lead Level Designer job listing on Question Games’ Careers page reads. 
The requirements section of this listing reveals that multiplayer experience is a must for anyone who applies, which could hint that this South Park game could feature some kind of multiplayer. This would be especially interesting because both South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: The Fractured But Whole were single-player. 
“Multiplayer Experience – Shipped at least one multiplayer game as a senior level designer or have equivalent relevant experience,” the requirements for the Lead Level Designer position read.

You can check out the full Careers page here, but there’s not much else to gleam from the listings. Whether or not this South Park game resembles the last two released or is something totally different, only time will tell. For now, read Game Informer’s South Park: The Stick of Truth review and then check out Game Informer’s South Park: The Fractured But Whole review.

Twelve Minutes: a timeloop thriller. Lemnis Gate: a tactical FPS where you out time loop one another. The Forgotten City, the Outer Wilds DLC, watching a man throw a “traditional shaped returning” boomerang on YouTube. All of them, time loops.
I’m absolutely sick of them. So here’s me hoping that 2022 is the year of the "time skip", instead. Or at least, one of these coming years an excessive number of games built around skipping time. Yes, they aren't without their flaws, but I'd argue they're less repetitive and capable of greater surprise. Alright, at least hear me out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

With all of the rumours regarding the infamous 'Switch Pro' and the eventual release of the Switch OLED model last year, we've hardly had a chance to think about Nintendo's true next generation of hardware. For the past year or two, the Switch has been described on more than one occasion as being in the "middle" of its lifecycle, suggesting there are plenty more years for it to thrive.
But, should history repeat itself once more, something new will eventually take over the reins. Decades since this hobby of ours took off, we're still yet to see a system live on without a successor replacing it after a handful of years – so what does Nintendo's future look like, and when can we expect a new system to take Switch's place?

Yesterday, Game Informer reported that Days Gone director Jeff Ross said Bend Studio's latest game sold more than Ghost of Tsushima, which recently hit a milestone after selling 8 million copies. However, in a recent livestream with former God of War and Twisted Metal director David Jaffe, Ross revealed that his source for the sales numbers was a now-defunct website called Gamestat, which tracks PlayStation Trophy data, as reported by PushSquare. 
Here's what Ross said: "Where I got my data from, I had access to a lot of telemetry, and I could see stuff and when we were at 5 million copies – when we were announced at 5 million copies – the telemetry data was at 5.8 [million].

Does the idea of Pokémon Snap but with dogs appeal to you? Pupperazzi has you covered. Armed with your trusty camera, you’ll capture a variety of dog breeds in a world seemingly populated with nothing but canines. You’ll catch them doing all manner of strange things, like jamming to music, riding bicycles (somehow), or executing death-defying skateboard tricks. You can adorn pups in different outfits and upgrade your camera to capture better, more dynamic photos. Watch the most recent gameplay trailer below if you need something to cheer you up.

It’s also one of the biggest showcases of PC gaming hardware in the calendar, and CES 2022 has been no exception, with major component reveals from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia along with loads of gaming laptop, peripheral, and monitor announcements.


This year’s show is technically still going for another day, but like a Foo Fighters album, CES tends to front-load the good stuff. As such, it’s basically safe to start rounding up any PC gaming kit highlights. Some of these have been a long time coming – like the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 desktop GPU with full ray tracing and DLSS support – while others might be pleasant surprises or eye-catching, if likely to be witheringly expensive, new concepts.

As first reported by Video Games Chronicle, Ross said he was especially interested in rebooting PlayStation’s long-dormant Resistance series, which was created by Insomniac Games back in the PlayStation 3 generation. Like the pitch to Days Gone 2, though, it was rejected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I’m not going to lie – when Kilter Films, Bethesda Game Studios, and Amazon announced back in 2020 that a Fallout TV series was in the works, I immediately wrote it off. Surely it’d be another video game TV project that would stumble through development until it’s quietly canceled, only for the world to collectively ask years later, “Hey, what happened to that Fallout show?” That’s what video game movies and TV developments have done to me. In this instance, though, it appears I’m wrong because production is moving forward and the show now has a director. 
Those familiar with HBO’s Westworld series might recognize him, too, as it’s the same person who created and executive produced that series: Jonathan Nolan, the brother of famed director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Night, Inception…]]></summary>

Famitsu's Japanese chart figures are now in for the two weeks spanning 20th December to 2nd January, revealing that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are still performing very strongly indeed at the top of the pile.
The two games sold a further 231,275 retail copies combined in Japan over the holidays, taking their total physical sales count to almost 2.4 million. Once again, they're followed by a top ten made up exclusively of Nintendo Switch titles, with Mario Party Superstars coming in second place with 206,145 physical sales over the period.

We might still be saying "Happy New Year" to people we meet, but we're well into January now and when we survey the upcoming slate of games for Switch, we have to say it's looking particularly tasty. However, as great as Pokémon and Kirby are shaping up, it's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 that will likely have Switch owners salivating over the coming 365 days in gaming. Yes, 2022 is the year we'll be skydiving into one of the most anticipated sequels in video game history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2022 is finally here and that can only mean one thing. We've got another year of hip new video games to look forward to, and we've been busy rustling up the ones we're most excited about. In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won't find them here, but trust us, you'll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. 
There are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we've listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We've got games big and small here, and they're all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we've missed something? Why not take to the comments below and tell us all about it. You might just convince us to put it on our radars. But enough from me. Here are our 43 most anticipated games of 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Arceus is right around the corner, hitting Switch on January 28, and Nintendo has been slowly revving up its marketing for the upcoming hub-based RPG. That continued today with a new six-minute trailer released on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account and while the entire video is in Japanese, it still gives us a great look at what’s in store for us in the Hisui region. 
Namely, the locations, pocket monsters, and NPCs we’ll be encountering. It also gives us our best look at the HUD and menu screens in Pokémon Legends: Arceus thus far as well. If you’ve been following this game since its announcement, you’ll notice that the game is looking much better than when it was first shown, too. 
Click here to watch embedded media


Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been described by Nintendo as an open-hub game, akin to the Monster Hunter series, rather than an open-world one and while that’s still the case, this trailer reveals these hubs are actually quite large – big enough to make flying around on a Pokémon or riding on the back of one in water very viable. 
The entire trailer is exciting and it offers us our best look at Pokémon Legends: Arceus yet so if you’re excited for this upcoming RPG, it’s definitely worth six minutes of your time. 
For more, be sure to check out this trailer released last month that introduces the Diamond and Pearl clans to the game and then read about how Hisuian Voltorb still somehow looks like a Pokéball. Check out this reveal of the Hisuian forms for Zorua and Zoroark in Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.

For the upcoming sequel, Guerrilla Games looked at fan feedback, revisited ideas that were too ambitious for the first game, and tapped into the studio’s well of creativity to make Aloy’s exploits even more exciting. For our latest cover story, we saw Forbidden West in action and learned firsthand about how the sequel is making some worthwhile changes to improve upon its predecessor.

We expect improved graphics with each new entry in a series, and so far, the footage shown for Forbidden West has been extremely impressive. But sometimes it takes seeing the game up-close to really notice its finer points. “…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looks like E3 2022 will follow in the footsteps of last year’s show by being a digital-only event. Although the hope after 2021 was a return to an in-person gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center (with even the city’s mayor crossing his fingers), the ongoing pandemic has nixed those plans. 
In a statement to Venture Beat, posted below, the ESA confirmed that the coronavirus remains a major issue so it’s playing it safe for one more year:
As we all know, the pandemic is still very much a thing, especially with the Omicron variant running rampant. This isn’t the biggest shock in the world but still disappointing for fans, developers, and media hoping to reconnect in person this June. Since the pandemic started, E3 has been canceled outright in 2020 and the 2021 edition saw the event unfold through a series of livestreams and digital meetings held on the ESA’s website. If nothing else, it'll be interesting to see how the ESA iterates on last year's approach.

No, I hated rolling credits on the game because I knew this phenomenal AAA VR experience was over, and I didn’t know when I would ever have another VR adventure of that caliber again.
Anyone who has ever put on a VR headset can tell you that the technology is promising. Anyone who owns a VR headset can tell you how slow the industry has been to fulfill that promise. I love creative offerings like Beat Saber, Superhot VR, and Pistol Whip. Those entertaining diversions make me happy to have a headset, but they only provide one type of experience. I still crave meatier, story-based VR adventures. Stuff like Half-Life: Alyx and … and … and wel…]]></summary>

We all love it, and some of the best games have it, whether that takes the form of a bombastic shooter, sword-clashing melee fest, or good old-fashioned brawler. Action is one of the most universally beloved genres, so we’ve compiled a list of upcoming games that already have our adrenaline pumping. Rather than rank them, each game is arranged in chronological release order so you’ll know how long you’ll have to wait before you can get your hand on them. And hey, just because an action game didn’t make the cut doesn’t mean it won’t be worth a look! These are just the titles that, at a glance, raised our eyebrows the highest.

Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I'm nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can't be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

The sky is falling and only the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Warrior of Light are prepared to take on whatever or whoever is causing the calamitous end of days. Endwalker signals the conclusion to the Hydaelyn and Zodiark storyline, a central conflict between the forces of light and darkness that's been at the core of FFXIV's story since its early days. The expansion brings multiple new zones and two exciting new Jobs, the Sage and Reaper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far Cry 6 was released last October, and while the base game offered dozens of hours of FPS action gameplay, Ubisoft upped the ante by committing to free content drops and three paid DLCs. 
Some of the free DLC includes Los Pollos Hermanos and Heisenberg outfits from Breaking Bad, while the first paid DLC, dubbed Vaas’ Insanity, gave players the chance to play as the infamous villain from Far Cry 3. Vaas’ Insanity was the first part of a villain-focused trilogy included in the Far Cry 6 season pass that costs $40. The second villainous DLC will star Far Cry 4’s Pagan Min, and now, Ubisoft announced that it’s coming next week. 
Dive into the twisted mind of Pagan Min. The new Pagan: Control DLC is coming January 11. pic.twitter.com/2hIr1xoPkc
January 5, 2022
More specifically, it will go live on January 11. Like the Vaas experience before it and the forthcoming Joseph Seed DLC coming after it, this Pagan Min-focused episode called Pagan: Control is a rogue-like experience that sees the Troy Baker-voiced villain “struggling to escape the horrors of their own minds.” You will die a lot and retry a lot, Ubisoft promises. 
You begin with a pistol and must find new weapons and powers to progress through Pagan Min’s mind. You’ll be able to give this experience a go in five days on January 11. 
For more, read about the other DLC offerings you can expect in Far Cry 6, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review. Read about the Vaas’ Insanity DLC after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

After weeks of public silence, Activision has responded to an ongoing strike at Raven Software. 
The ongoing Raven employee strike, which began after a dozen contract QA workers were let go in December, entered its third week this week with no formal acknowledgment from Activision. However, a new statement from upper Raven Software management (see: Activision management) given to GamesIndustry.biz reveals that the company is in active discussions with employees. 
For more about story, read Game Informer’s prior coverage of the Raven layoffs, including Activision’s statement following the transition of 500 contract employees to full-time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West's new west coast setting isn’t just inhabited by fearsome new machines. Aloy will also encounter tribes and cultures, some friends and some foes. Guerrilla Games released a video reintroducing players to familiar tribes such as the Oseram, Utaru, and Tenakth, giving a rundown of their culture and standing in this region of the country. 
We see the Utaru, a culture in tune with nature, singing songs in an effort to cure their land of the blight. On the flip side, the battle-hardened Tenakth, which is divided into three clans, serves as the dominant tribe in the Forbidden West. One of those clans is the Regalla, the rebel faction shown in previous trailers that are at war with their fellow clansfolk. As powerful as the Tenakth is, the trailer hints at rumors of an even stronger group residing on the outer reaches of the Forbidden West.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Konami, the Japanese company best known for squandering every shred of goodwill they built through series like Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, are getting into NFTs. Of course they are. Should've guessed. While publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Take-Two are still contemplating NFTs, I am not remotely surprised that Konami are one of the first notable names to actually start selling useless digital junk. Next week, they will hold an auction for NFTs of videos, artwork, and music from early Castlevania games. Konami, man.

It turns out there have been some terrific optimizations squeezed out of that latest-generation Xeon Scalable platform on Intel's Clear Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio director and co-founder of Playground Games, Gavin Raeburn, has revealed that he’s leaving the company. 
First reported by Windows Central, he has revealed that after co-founding and working at Playground for 12 years, he’s retiring from the racetrack. This news comes two months after the studio put out its most successful title yet in Forza Horizon 5, which at the time of its release, also had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever.

“After 12 years working on five award-winning Forza Horizon games, Gavin Raeburn is leaving Playground Games as studio director,” Turn 10 Studio Head and Forza franchise lead Alan Hartman told Windows Central. “A founding member of Playground Games, we thank Gav for his leadership and contributions to the Forza franchise and wish him all the best.” 
Hartman said another Playground co-founder, Trevor Williams, will transition from General Manager to Studio Head effective immediately, replacing Raeburn. He also said the studio will continue to focus on updates to Forza Horizon 5 and the ongoing development of its Fable reboot, which was officially announced in 2020. 
As noted by Windows Central, Raeburn has quite the history in the racing genre, having worked on Codemasters’ TOCA series, Dirt, and Grid. He left Codemasters in 2009 to create Playground Games, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. 
There’s no word on what’s next for Raeburn or if he’s even staying in games.

Check out this new Xbox and OPI nail polish collaboration that unlocks a unique Forza Horizon 5 car wrap after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games have pulled the curtains back on the newest agent joining Valorant and her name is Neon. 
Revealed by way of a special agent trailer, Neon is a fast-paced electric shooter that seemingly specializes in zooming all over a given map quicker than any other agent in the game. The short story trailer, which runs less than three minutes, reveals that Neon is a Manila, Philippines-based agent with an excellent taste in music. 
Click here to watch embedded media


As you can see in the trailer, Neon is a fan of Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia and 88rising. She’s also seemingly a fan of dreaming about what players are going to accomplish on the battlefield using her powers. We see her sprinting and sliding all over the maps shown in the trailer, using her electricity to make it easier. However, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to shoot while sprinting so don’t expect to be the run-n-gunner Neon might appear to be. 
We also get a quick look at one of her abilities where Neon lifts two large and long walls of electricity in a straight line, walls that she’s free to run in and out of. 
The trailer also reveals that Neon will arrive in Valorant with Episode 4: Disruption, although a release date for this new episode (which is what Valorant calls its big updates) has not yet been revealed. However, the current battle pass ends on January 11 so some fans have speculated that Episode 4 will begin the following day on January 12. 
While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the shooter in Game Informer’s Valorant review and then read about how Valorant’s director is no longer working on the game and instead working on a new secret project at Riot. Be sure to read about how a mobile version of Valorant is on the way after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nobody Saves The World, the upcoming action RPG from Guacamelee developers Drinkbox Studios, has a release date and it’s less than two weeks away. 
More specifically, it will be released on January 18 and as previously announced, it will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam for $24.99. However, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber or a member of Microsoft’s PC Game Pass, the game will hit those services on day one, meaning you can download them for free.

Hopefully, you’ve got a friend lined up to play Nobody Saves The World with, too, because the game features online co-op, although it does not feature cross-play so you’ll need to be on the same platform as your friend to play together. 
In Nobody Saves The World, you control a “featureless nobody” that can transform into a variety of different animals and creatures, including a slug, a ghost, a dragon, a rat, a robot, and much more. You’ll need to swap between over 15 different forms with mixed and matched abilities to unlock and complete quests to progress through the game’s narrative. 
Speaking of abilities, Drinkbox says there are over 80 different Form abilities, meaning each player will likely have their own customized build that works best for them. You might play as an egg that leaves a trail of slime behind you or a rat that shoots fireballs – the choice is up to you. 
If you’re interested in the soundtrack, which was created by composer Jim Guthrie (Below, Sword and Sorcery), it will be available for purchase on Steam and other platforms when the game is released on January 18. 
Nobody Saves The World was announced back in March and it quickly gained traction as yet another exciting title from Drinkbox. For more, watch this New Gameplay Today segment about the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, the upcoming Jet Set Radio-inspired game by the makers of Lethal League, is all about style. With that in mind, what’s cooler than hitting a bunch of sick tricks set to a fresh soundtrack? Not much based on this latest trailer. 
Although the video doesn’t update players on when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will drop, it does provide a glimpse into some of the cool moves you can pull off. Whether you’re tearing up the city on a pair of skates, a bike, or a skateboard, executing stylish rail grinds and nailing combos is not only fun but vital to progression. The crux of the game is tagging enough spots with your graffiti and out-tricking other crews to earn enough reputation to challenge them for territory control. Mastering traversal also matters for reaching hidden areas of the city that may contain secrets.

If this modern homage has you chomping at the bit to play it, developer Team Reptile promises in the video's description that it's “going in hard” to get Bomb Rush Cyberfunk out the door this year. The game is slated to arrive on Switch and PC.

Despite how great it feels to play as Peter Parker in both versions, one thing neither version could do was really put you behind the Spider-Man mask. 
However, one player has come up with a unique way to give people a way to see what the game looks like through Peter Parker’s eyes: stop-motion.

As you can see in YouTube video above, creator ItIsSpid decided to take on a daunting task to show us what swinging through Insomniac Games’ New York City is like on PlayStation 5, both via Peter Paker and Miles Morales, and it looks amazing. We’re treated to a minute and 40 seconds of hundreds of first-person screenshots (courtesy of the games’ impressive photo modes) and we’ve never wanted a first-person Spider-Man game more. 
Of course, it takes a couple of seconds for your eyes to adjust to the stop-motion effect but when it sings, it looks great. 
“Using Spider-Man PS5/Miles Morales PS5 photo mode, I decided to try and combine 850+ photos and make a first-person gameplay stop-motion,” ItIsSpid’s YouTube description reads. 
For more, check out our reviews of these two games in Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man review and Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review. Be sure to check out this reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The musou genre is a long-spanning one with dozens of entries in it, but despite that, it has remained relatively niche in the grand scheme of things. 
However, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has helped buck that trend as Omega Force has revealed (on Twitter) that its Zelda musou, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, has shipped a whopping 4 million units since its release back in November of 2020. Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock. 
『#ゼルダ無双 厄災の黙示録』の全世界累計出荷本数が400万本を突破しました。プレイしていただいた皆さま、誠にありがとうございます。
https://t.co/VV14JMDMeV#ゼルダの伝説 #Zelda
January 5, 2022
So while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. 
For more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review.

Ghost of Tsushima is as popular as ever, with 8 million copies sold. 
We're thrilled and amazed that #GhostOfTsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies!

A recent tweet (seen above) revealed the game's newest milestone: "We're thrilled and amazed that Ghost of Tsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies! Thank you so much to everyone who has played since launch! We are so incredibly appreciative and grateful for the support!" 
It's no surprise that Ghost of Tsushima had such a sizable player base. Cutting-edge graphics (somehow made more impressive with the PlayStation 5's Director's Cut), fluid combat mechanics with flashy animations, and a story/game world inundated in Japanese culture and samurai lore help set Ghost of Tsushima apart from its contemporaries. Game Informer's Matt Miller loved the vanilla game, awarding it a 9.5. In his impression piece on the Director's Cut, he echoed the same shining sentiments from his original review while speaking to the added content:
"I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it's further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on."
I've been playing through the Director's Cut myself and am completely enamored with Ghost of Tsushima's art direction and overall vibe. What are your thoughts on Sucker Punch's latest IP? Let us know down below!]]></summary>

PlayStation President Jim Ryan took the stage to provide details on the company's next-generation virtual-reality device. Following its tried and true naming scheme for gaming devices, the PSVR successor is officially called PlayStation VR2. Its controllers are no longer Move wands, but rather PlayStation VR2 Sense Controllers. Ryan spoke about the headset proving a greater sense of presence and increasing the visual fidelity from the previous model. 
Technical specifications of PSVR2 have been posted on the PlayStation Blog which reveals all kinds of cool tidbit about the headset and controllers. PSVR2 will feature OLED 2000x2040 resolution screens per eye which…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's shop updates every day at 4 p.m. CT with new skins, emotes, and gliders to acquire, but the game map often changes without warning. That happened again today in a small way. If you explore slightly to the northeast of Logjam Lumberyard, you'll find a new circular patch of dirt just beyond a hill. Investigating the scene reveals a large driller protected by IO guards at a landmark called Mole Team: Omega. That's right, the Imagined Order (better known as IO) is back and it appears they drilled through the island.
Odds are we'll see more IO troops on the island in the days and weeks ahead, likely culminating in a new story development. There's a chance it could tie into The Foundation unlockables countdown, which currently sits at 30 days.
If you want to check out the drilling site, make sure you bring a weapon, as IO will open fire the second they see you. Look for a tent and you'll find a large weapon cache. A launcher awaits on the far side of the dirt pile, so you should be able to make a quick getaway after getting the rare loot.
I can't wait to see where Epic goes with this next. We're still waiting for tornadoes and that strange six-legged purple monster to show up, but the arrival of IO is a nice surprise that should lead to a new antagonist showing up soon.]]></summary>

My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.
While shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …]]></summary>

Whenever I talk to anyone about the latest middling entry in Madden NFL or NBA 2K, the first question I always receive is, "Should I buy this one if I already own last year's?" I used to have to think more about whether I'd recommend a sports gamer pick up the latest iteration, but over the last several years, the games have felt just that way: iterative. Now, my answer is always, "How important is [this year's tentpole feature] to you? How important is having the latest rosters?" If even one of those is wishy-washy, my answer is either "Wait for a sale" or "Just play last year's game." This song and dance has only become more noticeable as the years have continued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo Infinite's shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation doesn't have much other than one cool item that ties into the return of the Fracture: Tenrai event.
The expensive item of the week is a 2,000 credit ($17.99) legendary mythic effect set called Enlightened Path, which adds pink rose petals to your Spartan's footsteps, slides, and spawns. Also included in this bundle is a white mask called Grand Play that can be applied to your nameplate, armor, vehicles, and weapons. I have to point out that the price for this bundle is ridiculous, especially since the player usually gets an armor set at this rate.
The more interesting offering this week is the Meditative State bundle, with the standout piece being the Imperial Crest helmet attachment for the Yoroi armor core earned in the Fracture: Tenrai event. This set also offers a cool coloring option called Expressive Soul which adds samurai-like highlights to the armor in gold and green. The bundle is rounded out with a triumphant stance called Mirror Tale, and an epic charm called Black Opal. This pack is 1,000 credits.
If you want to focus on your weapons and pick up another high-priced bundle, the Blacksteel Katana set is rather striking, adding a dragon scale effect to the MA40 assault rifle. You also get Black Cat weapon coloring, a Tiger Energy charm, and a Sun and Shadow icon to apply to weapons, vehicles, and more.
The item of the day is the Desert Sun bundle, offering the Ryuu visor for the Yoroi armor, and a dull green armor coating called Forgotten Sands.
All told, this week's offerings rank among the game's worst to date. The good news, though, is Fracture: Tenrai is back and we can keep working on that battle pass.]]></summary>

Many have long expected it to eventually be banned, though, especially after Valve partnered with Perfect World to launch the limited Steam China. This might now be happening. Maybe. Or it's possibly being hindered, at least. This all started with a big stink on Christmas Day that led some to declare Steam had been banned by the Great Firewall which restricts access to many sites outside China, but the reality is not so clear cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re an Apex Legends fan that’s been wanting more out of the game’s lore, Respawn has released a new installment in its Stories from the Outlands series centered on fan-favorite Bangalore. 
For those new to Stories from the Outlands, the series expands on the game’s lore by shining a narrative spotlight on its roster of Legends. Think of them as Respawn’s take on Blizzard’s Overwatch shorts. Gridiron sees Bangalore get torn between her responsibilities as a soldier and the relationship with her brother after the Battle of Gridiron. Clocking in at over eight minutes, the well-animated cinematic is a neat way of fleshing out of the game’s original favorites.

Meanwhile, Apex Legends continues to march forward with the recent introduction of its fourth map, Storm Point.

Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

It's being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don't go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare's recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it's being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games, the makers of Valorant and League Of Legends, have agreed to pay out $100 million (£74m) as part of a proposed settlement to a class-action suit brought against them for "systemic sex discrimination and harassment". Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn't enough.

We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there's one thing I've learned about myself in 2021, it's that I'm a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don't provide any material benefit to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.


Tainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.

First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.


Somewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.

Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.


World’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.

The death of the year does bring some sorrow, with Imogen leaving us, so do say goodbye if you haven't already. Then, return to tell me: what are you playing this holiday?

For 24 hours, Epic are handing out Pathfinder: Kingmaker free for keepsies. It's a vast fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder pen 'n' paper system, played out in ye olde isometric perspective. The sort of RPG that's fascinating to some, offputting to others—so a great candidate for a freebie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is so popular you can’t buy it anymore. To prevent overcrowding and crashing servers, Square Enix have had to halt free trials and new sales to keep the game stable after an unprecedented surge in popularity this summer. Between that and the global shortage of materials to add more servers, it may be quite some time until new players are able to experience it. If you have an active subscription and manage to brave the long queues however, you’re one of the lucky few who get to experience something truly special. For everyone else: hang in there, it will be worth the wait.

If I have to. The indie games I've been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to 'em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.

Nothing says 'bad family Christmas' like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point 'n' click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.

No more NieR games for us... unless he receives a massive pile of money. Quickly, it becomes clear he's just joshing around. Another classic ruse from the man in the Emil mask, and a subtle hint that they may have something new in the works. Plus, it's just a really delightful video and you should all watch it.

There's some Christmassy-ness flowing in to tide me over, thanks to the mini-Christmas tree in my room. Every year it's popped on the wardrobe alongside an honorary Lynx Africa. They share the same festive colours, after all.
Having pondered my tree for a bit, I thought about trees in games and how they make for good side quests. Now join me by the bark, as I examine why this might be the case in a roundabout manner.

It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.
But then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.
Anyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!

Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal "to play" list is out of control.
And yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?

Failed boots, mainly, which of course makes it harder to apply potential fixes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.
Vertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV players haven’t had it easy these last few weeks. The sheer success of its Endwalker expansion resulted in lengthy login queues and server errors. It’s become so popular that Square Enix have temporarily stopped selling the game, taking its Starter and Complete Editions off sale. All the while, some low-poly grapes stayed static in the breeze. Jagged, delicious, minding their own business. Until their blockiness was papped and thrust into the public eye. Memes ensued and the grapes became the talk of the town, so much so that they’ve been smoothed out in the latest patch, much to everyone’s dismay.

We could do anything together, we four. And then we stumbled upon this door...

It's a gorgeous-looking adventure that came out in early access back in October, but unfortunately the launch didn't go as well as the devs had hoped it would. Yesterday, they announced that they've had to lay off around 25 employees to keep the studio going. They add that development will continue, albeit at an understandably slower pace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. It's been a funny old year, 2021. On the games side, it's often felt like a year of shifting goalposts. Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. 
That said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.

Developers EggNut have announced that a new Backbone game is coming in 2022, dropping us back into the snowy, animal-filled city. We don't know much about it yet, but Backbone is an excellent detective puzzle game, and a gorgeous one at that, so I have high hopes for the next one.

If you didn't have a chance to play it earlier this year, it's now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it's one of our favourite games of 2021.

That said, one of the biggest underlying causes of MIA CPU and graphics card stock has been a shortage of the chips needed to make them, and it’s a shortage that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned could likely continue into 2023.

I'd have given up on the game if it weren't so interesting. For one thing, none of those deaths were final. He died as a child and came back. He died as a teenager and came back. These were not saved games, but ordinary occurrences. It's an interesting world made infuriating by awkward design choices.
