        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>

However, the Killer's regular ole axe seemed weirdly ordinary for such a monster, and now some players believe that the axe is just the tip of the murderous iceberg.


Starting today, Dead by Daylight's March 2024 roadmap promises something new every week for the entire month. We already knew The Unknown Killer, Sable Ward Survivor, and Greenville Square map would arrive on March 12 with the All Things Wicked Chapter. What we didn't know, though, was that The Unknown, not to be confused with the Willy Wonka Experience Glasgow's AI-generated villain, may wield different weapons with the various skins players unlock or purchase for it.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I sat down to play three hours of Dragon's Dogma 2 at a Capcom event last month, I gave myself two broad objectives. The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. 


In Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled "pawn" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.

That's big for Team Hollywood, but I still have a hard time believing that Dune has done more for movies than it has for video games — so long as you ignore the kerfuffle over whether it influenced Star Wars.


Even though the Dune games are far from occupying our most vivid memories of the real-time strategy boom of the '90s, the whole genre owes its existence to this series. Also, there's more to Dune games than just RTS. Not all of the series' forays into other genres generated success, but even its failures have stories worth telling. Let's rank all Dune games out there.

Sitting in Capcom's San Francisco, California, office, just 30 minutes to go until my interview with Itsuno, I saw that he tweeted about Dragon's Dogma 2's framerate. Specifically, he revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Dragon's Dogma 2 will release with an uncapped framerate.

Once you get to a point in the game where you find a weapon or frame you want, you’ll also have to know where to get the components. One of the more elusive resources in the game is Tellurium, so we’ll help you find the best place to farm this rare crafting material in Warframe.


Where to farm Tellurium in Warframe


The best place to farm Tellurium in Warframe is in the Survival mission, Ophelia on Uranus. It does not matter if you play this in normal mode or on Steel Path. As long as you survive this mission for at least ten minutes, your chances of obtaining at least one unit of this resource are quite high.

According to one of the company's executives, AMD is now ready to lean more heavily towards AI-based technologies.


Whether big things really are on the horizon for AMD's AI efforts remains to be seen, of course, but the CTO Mark Papermaster believes 2024 will be a "huge year" for the company in this regard. In a recent interview hosted on the No Priors podcast (via IGN) Papermaster said that AMD now has a full stack of AI-based hardware and software capabilities, which will help in "enabling [their] entire portfolio" of services.

No Rest for the Wicked (NRftW) graces Game Informer's cover this month, and it marks a dramatic shift for Moon Studios for several reasons. For one, it's an action RPG from the team that gave us two of the best platformers/Metroidvanias ever in Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. You can read all about what the game entails in our digital issue, which is available now. But another huge shift is that NRftW will first launch into Steam Early Access on April 18.

As first reported by GameSpot, CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games for Warner Bros. Discovery, J.B. Perrette, recently outlined the company’s plans for the future while speaking at a Morgan Stanley event. Perrette touted the success of Hogwarts Legacy before using Suicide Squad as an example of one of its big swing-and-misses in the AAA gaming market during a time of increased volatility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.
Warning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

The 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.
Players take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

Titled "The Last Ronin," Eastman and Laird envisioned it as the final Turtles story set 30 years in the future. While Eastman and Laird never got around to creating that storyline in the original run of their comics under their company Mirage Studios, the idea stuck with Eastman through the years, and decades later, as part of the franchise's new life with IDW Publishing, he worked with his longtime collaborator Tom Waltz to bring the idea to the pages of a five-issue miniseries that ran from 2020 to 2022.

        <updated>2024-03-05T18:35:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it launched last October, Alan Wake 2 was noted as a superb follow-up to its cult Xbox 360 predecessor. Visually, it was something to behold. However, being quite a graphically demanding game meant people with older hardware were left out—until now.


Recently, Eurogamer was given exclusive access to an upcoming patch for Alan Wake 2 which aims to optimize the sequel for previous-gen graphics cards. Specifically, the update will put focus on making the game compatible with Nvidia GTX 10-series GPUs, powered by the Pascal architecture.




In a benchmark test, a Digital Foundry video found that, once the patch starts rolling out on March 6, those with GTX hardware should see some pretty significant upticks in performance.


It's not a cure-all, though


Currently, the likes of the GTX 1060 (which is the fourth most used GPU on Steam) don't support mesh shaders, something AW2 uses for better visual acuity. However, the new patch should fix this. 


The video above shows that framerates do increase, boosting overall performance by around 45%, even up as much as 85% for the likes of the GTX 1080.


However, the aforementioned 1060 is still not entirely suitable for the game to run at a decent rate. While Digital Foundry saw increases from 15 to 25 frames on average (thanks to the removal of mesh shaders) in dense areas, this still falls short of what most gamers expect these days, which is 30fps at the very minimum.


There also appear to be no optimizations for the AMD equivalent, the RX 580, a card that came out in 2017. Given that Team Red is no longer supporting this GPU, it's probably not in Remedy's best interests to make Alan Wake 2 compatible with this (and much older) hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck may have its work cut out for it soon, as pre-orders for the upcoming Claw device from MSI are being taken. We also have a release date, with one of the models launching on March 8 in the US, followed by the other two variants a week later.


As reported by Videocardz, the Claw is up on sites like Newegg, with options to place a pre-order ready for launch day. There are three variations planned, and it looks like the mid-range device releases first, priced at $749. Which is not cheap, really.




For that price, you'll get a Windows-based handheld gaming PC with an Intel Core Ultra 7-155H CPU under the hood and 512GB of NVMe SSD storage.


And many more initialisms


There is a cheaper model in the Intel Core Ultra 5-135H variant, which also comes with 512GB capacity. This is currently priced at $699 on Newegg and with a March 15 release date.


The same goes for the more expensive Claw, which will set you back $799. That benefits from the same processor as the mid-range model but does have 1TB of SSD storage.


On top of this, MSI recently announced that the Claw also comes with seven days of Ubisoft+ for free. Whether that's going to justify the cost is dependent on how often you're likely to use Ubisoft's service, I suppose. Also, the fact that the above tweet says the offer available is from February 15 is a bit odd seeing as the device isn't even out yet. Not sure if that's a typo or not.


In any case, we're seeing quite the flood of Steam Deck competitors hit the market lately. We've already had offerings from ASUS and Lenovo, but it feels as though Valve's mobile PC is still a lot of people's first choice for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios' TV adaptation of Fallout is right around the corner, premiering April 12 on Amazon Prime. You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. 
That's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.


As you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. 
It's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. 
For more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series. After that, check out the first Fallout TV series trailer. 
What do you think of this controller? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades, the critically acclaimed roguelite from developer Supergiant Games, is coming to Netflix later this month. It will be available to all subscribers on iOS devices starting March 19, but you can pre-register right now.
While Netflix might sound like an odd fit for a game that's available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, Netflix says this mobile version of Hades features 60 FPS gameplay, redesigned menus and interfaces, fully customizable on-screen controls, cloud saves, achievements, and offline play. 
Check out a new trailer for Hades on Netflix for yourself below: 


We really enjoyed Hades here at Game Informer, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in our review for being "a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships," amongst other things like its high-octane action gameplay. 
Hades coming to Netflix might be the perfect excuse to replay the game ahead of the Early Access debut of its sequel, Hades II, which is set to begin this year. 
Hades joins a growing list of great games available now or soon on Netflix, like Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, Katana Zero, Death's Door, and Braid: Anniversary Edition. 
Are you going to check out Hades on Netflix later this month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-03-05T16:33:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Paso, Elsewhere developer Strange Scaffold has announced a five-game deal with publisher Frosty Pop. As part of the announcement, they’ve revealed a trailer for their next game, Life Eater, which is out on April 16, 2024.


I find this trailer rather unsettling.




The trailer shows off the game’s timeline interface where you must learn the habits and schedule of your quarry so that you may find the opportunity to abduct them. You play as a “modern day druid” who is tasked with performing an annual sacrificial ritual to delay the end of the world. It looks like once you have your quarry, you then take their organs to “water the flower.”


Life Eater looks to be a rather evocative game. It has you violate the lives of others while framed as someone performing a necessary evil. Just the fact that you’re learning intimate details of the lives of others and monitoring them for the moment to strike is rather discomforting. The information on the game even suggests that the whole “dark god” angle might be false. I'd play it.


The store page promises “replayable blend of authored and generated stories.” It features music from David Mason who was the composer of Dredge.


As an aside, there are modern-day Druids, as Druidry is a modern religion based on pagan cultures. I don’t think they generally converse with dark gods and perform sacrifices. Just weird to see that as a contextual descriptor.


Life Eater releases on PC on April 16, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maddeningly good fun.
Berserk Boy has been tipped as a Mega Man-inspired 16-bit adventure, but it’s actually closer to Inti Creates Gunvolt series, and even then feels markedly different.
Taking place in a future world where a scientist named Dr. Genos has gone rogue, you play Kei, a young boy who teams up with firebird Fiore to battle his way to saving the universe. The narrative isn’t particularly noteworthy, but it’s well handled with attractive intermittent stills and quick dialogue exchanges. It’s certainly less intrusive than the Gunvolt series in this respect, interjecting just enough story to make things whole without making you labour through excruciatingly drawn-out reams of waffle. Instead, its waffle is brief, occasionally mildly amusing, and mostly to the point.

If you like ravaged Gothic masonry and dramatic evening skies, you might like Voin. If you dislike fighting fireball-lobbing demons with a sword, you might not like Voin. If you like open-ended, changeable levels full of loot and secrets, you might like Voin. If you are confused about whether you'll like or dislike Voin, you might want to try it for yourself during the first public Steam playtest on Friday, March 8th.

Having spent all of 30 minutes with an early playtest build, I'm cautiously impressed. I suspect there are cooler, less-known inspirations at work, but this feels like a Demon's Souls-ified Doom Eternal that doesn't quite have Doom Eternal's swagger and precision, probably because it is the work of just one developer, Nikita Sozidar, rather than hundreds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moomin, the popular Finish comic character from the 1940s, is getting a video game in 2024 – and we're ready for it. You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.
I had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.
Check out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.

Well, that was quick... But also slow.
That Nintendo would take action against programs that circumvent security and open up obvious avenues to playing Switch games without having purchased them is entirely unsurprising given the platform holder's historic 'emulation is piracy' stance. But the speed with which Tropic Haze, the makers of Switch emulator Yuzu, capitulated to the platform holder's demands is yet another indication of the sobering strength of Nintendo's legal teams.

        <updated>2024-03-05T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Little Knight Games has revealed Mira and the Legend of the Djinns, an upcoming 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania inspired by Moroccan mythology. Set to be published by Assemble Entertainment, which is publishing Endzone 2 this spring, Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is due out on PC via Steam this year. 
In classic Metroidvania fashion, you can expect plenty of enemies and secrets to discover with a variety of tools, items, and abilities as you progress through the game. Plus, unlockable moves add flair to your exploration and combat encounters as you attempt to uncover the secret of the last Djinn. 
Check out Mira and the Legend of the Djinns for yourself below:
 

"Not every ancient treasure belongs in a museum, as treasure hunter Yuba discovers within the debris of the kingdom of Fallen Amazgesh," a press release reads. "There, Yuba meets a Djinn named Mira, a race long lost to the world of man, and the pair team up together to escape the ruins and discover Mira's lost memories."
Little Knight Games says the game's combat "emphasizes fluidity and experimentation, and allows you to switch between weapons and elemental modes on the fly." The Germany-based studio says it's a team of seven people from different countries around the world and that Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is a love letter to Metroidvanias, "featuring a world based on the Moroccan and Amazigh mythology." 

"Morocco has a rich culture filled with fantasy stories about Djinns and mysterious creatures," the press release reads. "With the team's diverse background, they wanted to show this in their very first game." 
Other Mira and the Legend of the Djinns features include a sprawling map full of secrets, fast action combat, and a mystery to keep you pushing forward. 
Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is due out on PC this year. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer's top 10 Metroidvanias to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.


Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.

Z připravených témat mohou strahováci nabídnout novou stabilní verzi KiCADu nebo simulátor QSpice s podporou digitálních bloků. Letos se na trhu objevil 6 GHz osciloskop relativně dostupný i pro bastlíře. Do použitelného stavu se dostal také automatizovaný 3D scanner, který si můžete doma vytisknout. A ukáží i solid state vysoušeče vzduchu, které nepotřebují žádnou údržbu a mají minimální spotřebu.

Ze světa softwaru zmíní přinejmenším nového majitele Altium Designeru nebo volně dostupné sborníky článků o bezpečnosti a reverzním inženýrství.

A pokud máte rádi naše okénko bizarností, pak Vás jistě pobaví seznam nepravd o čase, kterým věří programátoři. Jestli navíc k tomu chystáte svou zahradní techniku na sezónu, tak si možná můžete zahrát Doom na sekačce.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 6. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crema, the creators of much-liked Pokemon-like Temtem, are teasing a new untitled game set in the same universe - the mystifying Project Downbelow. It isn't Temtem: Swarm, aka Temtem Vampire Survivors, nor is it Temtem 2. But it will "try out new things we would love to see in a hypothetical Temtem 2", including a new combat system running on a "stronger" game engine. The tease accompanies news that Crema are making significant changes to Temtem as part of the game's update 1.7 - for one thing, they're getting rid of the whole microtransaction system. Temtempestuous times indeed!

The settlement details are quite cut and dry. Tropic Haze will pay Nintendo $2.4 million in damages and will halt all work on Yuzu and cease hosting Yuzu, distributing its code, or anything that promotes Yuzu and circumvents Nintendo's copyright protection.





3DS Emulator Citra ending as well

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two film wormed its way through theaters over the weekend, and if you've still got sand in the brain, there's plenty more where that came from. Namely, Funcom shared a closer look at the upcoming Dune: Awakening survival game, which is in the works for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.


To bridge the gap more elegantly, let's start with the "Creating Worlds, from Book to Film to Game" developer diary. This one has Funcom CCO Joel Bylos and Oscar-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser (Dune: Part One and Two, Rogue One) talking about what it takes to adapt something like Frank Herbert's classic novels. Dune: Awakening is ostensibly a survival/crafting game at its core, but those traditional survival elements eventually evolve from physical to political. See where the inspirations came from and how they expanded upon the world depicted in the film adaptation below.




The timing of Dune: Awakening's production seems to have paid off, particularly in the way they were able to visit the actual sets from the film in an effort to bring the world to life more accurately. The new tech utilized in Unreal Engine 5 certainly didn't hurt either, and it's cool to see how it also helped in previsualization for the films. 


For another look at what all that work is building up to, you can see some cinematics and gameplay in the new trailer.




How well Dune works in the open world survival genre remains to be seen. As for when we'll be able to run for our dear lives from every Sandworm rumbling beneath the surface, that also remains to be seen. There's no release date in place for Dune: Awakening just yet, but hopefully, we'll know more soon.

Tropic Haze, the creators of the Switch emulator Yuzu, have agreed to pay Nintendo USD $2.4 million in damages as well as shut down the emulator for the hybrid console, along with the 3DS emulator Citra. This news comes just a week after Nintendo filed a lawsuit against the creators, and around a day after Tropic Haze hired its own lawyer.
In this sudden development, a joint motion was filed earlier today (spotted via Ryan Brown on Bluesky) between Nintendo and Tropic Haze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone's initial Season 2 set-up strayed away from Zombies, leaving everything to Reloaded. Finally, the time has finally come for a MWZ update, as this week's drop includes additional Schematics and the latest Aether Rift. 


The Modern Warfare Zombies Season 2 Reloaded snippet dives into an "unknown event" at Urzikstan. Like the Story Act from Season 1, the next update opens another Rift to explore. However, the challenge isn't for the faint of heart, battling against numerous Mimics, Manglers, and, of course, zombies. The latest schematics will be handy here, especially with the Mags of Holding for quick reloads. 




Based on my experience from Season 1, Rift challenges are probably one of the most demanding events in MWZ. Don't even get me started on Act 4's Gorm…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Season 2 Reloaded just around the corner for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, new cosmetics and other content are on the horizon. One significant collaboration coming to MW3 and Warzone is Warhammer 40K. You're probably familiar with the ultra-popular franchise; it's made its way from books and tabletop games to video games and more. Soon, WH40K will be appearing in Call of Duty.


Space Marines, Sisters of Battle, and Astra Militarum skins come to Call of Duty


According to a tweet from the official Call of Duty account, skins inspired by the Warhammer 40,000 universe are coming to the game. Over the last few weeks since Season 2 launched, there have been leaks and hints about the collaboration coming soon. But this is the first official statement directly from the developers themselves. The tweet doesn't show details about what the characters look like in-game, just a small teaser image.


Most likely, the Warhammer 40,000 collaboration will come as an in-store purchase. This means it'll be something like $20 or more, as most items in the CoD store are. Hopefully, it comes with all three character skins in one and maybe a few other small cosmetics or a gun camo to really beef up your Warhammer loadout.


Hints of what's to come





Nothing official was announced about the contents of the upcoming collaboration, but a few leaks have surfaced. The data miner who first leaked the collaboration tweeted this video of the character select screen, among others.


The Warhammer 40,000 x Call of Duty collaboration content should be coming soon as we're almost to the start of season two reloaded. March 6 looks like the official launch, which should bring other new content and these new skins to the store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been dreaming about another platform for the stylishly sleepy rhythm game Melatonin, there's no need to pinch yourself. Developer Half Asleep announced plans to bring its chill beats to PlayStation 5 on March 12, 2024. 


True to the name of the devs themselves, Melatonin is all about bridging that gap between our reality and the world of dreams. Naturally, the best way to do so is through the lens of a rhythm game, complete with an appropriately dreamlike color palette and audio and visual cues that get the beat across without relying on traditional genre overlays and indicators. If you haven't checked it out yet, you can see a quick sample in the PS5 trailer below.




Melatonin launched on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store back in December 2023, with a Switch version following close behind. Rhythm game pros can up the challenge with hard mode, while those who just want to chill — which is understandable given the overall vibes of the game — can toggle various assist features to make it easier. There's a story mixed in with all that nice hand-drawn art, too, as you explore the protagonist's dreams and learn more about them in the process.


If you just want to make your own scenarios, there's also a level editor that lets you remix and mashup game stages. The PC version lets you use your own song files as long as you know their exact tempo, but it's not clear if the PS5 version offers the same suite of features. All we know about that part of the game is that it's billed as an "easy-to-use" tool, so we'll see how much of that holds true this time next week. In the meantime, you can just pop your headphones on and let the beat roll over you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has announced its next Partner Preview stream showcasing games from third-party publishers. The broadcast begins on March 6 at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM EST/ 7 PM GMT. 


The 30-minute stream will include trailers from multiple publishers, such as Capcom, Nexon, and Electronic Arts. The event also offers a glimpse into future Game Pass entries, release dates, and exclusive behind-the-scenes looks. 




Capcom's Action Strategy game, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, is among the titles scheduled for a gameplay-focused showing. It takes inspiration from other beloved Capcom games, like Okami and Shinsekai - Into the Depths. If you're an Xbox Game Pass user, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess will be available on Day One. 


As for EA, the Partner Preview showcases an inside look into Tales of Kenzera: Zau's combat and traversal. The single-player Metroidvania adventure explores the personal journey of actor Abubakar Salim after his father passed away. Based on his speech at the Game Awards, Tales of Kenzera: Zau is meant to challenge the harsh realities of grief, reclaiming the spirit of Zau's father.  


Nexon's The First Berserker: Khazan, an RPG Souls-like RPG, is also among those listed explicitly by Xbox Wire. The Xbox Partner Preview showcase will provide more information about the life of the playable character, General Khazan. The entry also adapts from the world of Nexon's Dungeon Fighter Online (NFO). 


The three mentioned above are the only games we know about, but there will likely be more gameplay features to come. This includes more release announcements and reveals, similar to other recent events. Tune into Xbox's YouTube or Twitch channels on March 6 to see what other adventures await for the Partner Preview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's clear by now that Helldivers 2 is way more than just a simple bug hunt co-op shooter. On top of its surprisingly deep gameplay mechanics and an ever-evolving campaign narrative, though, there's a whole extra layer of community-based meta-progression, with Supply Lines being a particularly notable highlight.


If you've been befuddled by how Helldivers 2 chooses which planets the Terminids and the Automatons attack next, it would appear that it's not all just the whims of a potentially sadistic dungeon master. According to a Helldiver 2 community member, Ghoxen, there's an entire Supply Line feature carefully hidden away from public eyes dictating how the war efforts progress, and it's way more intricate than the game might otherwise have you believe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not unheard of for games to feature nods to other games and eagle eyed players of The Sims 4 have noticed a less-than-subtle reference to Final Fantasy XIV’s Shadowbringers expansion in the latest Sims 4 Stuff Pack, Crystal Creations. 


Players noticed this rather obvious (at least to those Simmers who play FFXIV) reference in the description of the Spire-Shaped Gemstone. If you hover over the gemstone, its description reads, “Your own mini crystal tower than an exarch would be proud of.”


It's a clear nod to a fan-favorite character, the Crystal Exarch, from Shadowbringers. That, and the actual crystal tower, the centre of everything in the First and the stage for A Realm Reborn's Alliance Raids. Plenty there worth commemorating in a precious stone given what the 24-man raid eventually built up to. 




The Sims 4 has other FFXIV secrets, too


It’s not the first time that the Sims 4 devs have thrown FFXIV references into the game, either. In the Werewolves pack, one of the items carries the name “Racked Teak-a Greatshelves.” It's another nod to more landmarks from the MMO, The Rak’tika Greatwood, a Shadowbringers zone. 


More recently, in the Growing Together Expansion Pack featured one item, a small board filled with childrens drawings, among a long list of others. The swatches of this particular piece feature various references to FFXIV moments, one particularly obvious one being an image of a long-tailed blue bird flying around the planets. If you know, you know.

These references are clearly intentional and the Devs behind their inclusions are not quiet about their love for FFXIV. The dev responsible for the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves, SimGuruNova, has admitted in the past that they use far too many Fantasia. Importantly, though, they noted a preference to play as either Miqo’te or Au Ra during MSQ progress. There's something I can't blame them for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.
He's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Greedfall 2: The Dying World reveals that the game is launching into Early Access via Steam sometime this summer. The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.
Premiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. 


Spiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: 


Once its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of the first Greedfall here.]]></summary>

Inkborn Chronicles introduces a fun new RNG-based gameplay mechanic called Encounters. At random points throughout a TFT match, players will encounter legendary mythological figures from Runeterra. These figures add some sort of spin to the match, providing bonuses or altering gameplay completely.




A little chaos goes a long way


I've played every Teamfight Tactics set since the autobattler was originally released almost five years ago. Some of them changed things up more than others, but Inkborn Chronicles has the chance to be the biggest shake-up to gameplay yet with its Encounters system.

With some unbelievable heat surrounding the Dune franchise following last weekend's release of the critically acclaimed Dune: Part Two, Conan Exiles developer Funcom provided a huge update for its anticipated MMO, Dune: Awakening, during a livestreamed Dune Direct today. Last week, Funcom and Warner Bros. invited me to the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, California for an advance Dune Direct and Dune: Part Two screening.

According to Spiders' producer Reba Isber, the Greedfall community was eager to provide feedback on the original game via reviews and other means. This prompted the team to send out a survey that helped inform some of Greedfall 2's earliest design choices, but also helped the team conclude that they needed opinions from experienced players to realize the game's potential to the fullest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Sun, the studio behind Moonlighter and The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, has announced its city-building RTS, Cataclismo, is coming in July.
Cataclismo was first revealed last year and was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.


The game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. 
Cataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benjamin Franklin once said that "nothing is certain except death and taxes." Had he been alive today, he almost certainly would have said, "oh, and the other certainty is people will keep modding Doom until the end of time." Quite the forward thinker. Anyway, here's id Software's iconic FPS running on a toothbrush.


Just a few days ago, Twitter user atc1441 (thanks, Rock Paper Shotgun) uploaded a brief clip showing Doom running on a smart toothbrush. On the tiny screen of the Planck Mini, you can just about make the game out. The modder even goes as far as showing it being controlled by a mouse.




In a second tweet, we see they eventually managed to get it to run full-screen rather than in a small window. Now we can see the thing much clearer.


Fight demons...and tooth decay


According to atc1441 – who says their biggest passion is to "custom firmware on as many devices as possible" (no way) – the toothbrush itself, "contains an ESP32-C3 with 4MB Flash."


Using some additional downloads and a "miniwad" of Doom, they were able to compress the game down to the 4MB required for the flash. Hey presto: Doom on a toothbrush!


I don't think I'll ever get bored of the ways people can modify id's influential shooter, either tinkering with the original or getting it to run on all manner of devices. Just have a look: Doom on a robotic lawnmower, in an audio spectrogram, on a pair of earrings! 


One day we're going to reach the singularity and someone will boast how they got Doom to run inside Doom. Oh, wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things are starting to slow down for the plucky out-of-nowhere sensation that is Palworld. But it's still doing pretty well for itself, and if you are carrying on with it, you may be interested in this pretty nifty mod for the PC version.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, you can now add a mini-map to the Palworld UI, thanks to user T3R3NC3B over on Nexus Mods. Seems like such a small addition to the game, but given that it shows the location of all pals, it could well be an essential download for a lot of people.


Image via T3R3NC3B/Nexus Mods.


Here are just some of the features that "Paldar" comes with:



Shows player world location


Shows all Pals around you


Shows fast travel points


Shows other players


Shows lifmunk effigies


Shows dungeons


Shows chests


Shows skillfruit trees


Shows rare/shiny pals (indicated with the sparkles overlaid on the pals icon)


Shows bosses on map



Probably shows you where you left your keys as well


It also has a "mega zoomed-out mode for easy navigation." As this is a work-in-progress, there are plans to also add in displays for death locations, player and NPC camps, the ability to hide the mini-map, and more. So keep an eye out for updates to this mod.


T3R3NC3B says the download is compatible in both single-player and on dedicated servers, though "only if installed on clients."


With version 0.1.5.1 coming out recently, Palworld continues to iron out some of the kinks. It's still in Early Access, after all. Developer Pocketpair also said the game achieved over 25 million players not long ago. It must be doing something right, then. Well, apart from adding in an official mini-map, it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having turned 20 last year and being a dominant force in digital PC gaming, it's hard to imagine Steam got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2003. However, here we are, and the Valve service continues to reign supreme, as it reaches another concurrent player milestone.


According to the latest figures from SteamDB, 34,649,583 players were using Steam over the weekend. To put that into perspective (not that it really needs it), Worldometer shows the population of the UK is over 67.8 million people. This means Steam's new record was roughly half of the UK populace.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


This might partly because of the ongoing Dinos vs. Robots sale (as well as the many events that take place throughout the year), which ends today. Who knows, but it goes to prove that PC gaming in the modern era is showing no signs of slowing down.


Some were twiddling their thumbs, though


Okay, so 34.6 million is a staggering amount. However, of those, only ("only") 11.1 million were actually in-game, according to the breakdown below the graph. In total, the number equates to a 3.8% increase over February 2024. There. That's a little extra statistic for ya.


Originally built as a way for people to update Valve games over the internet, a lot of people struggled to adapt to the digital changes that were about to happen in gaming. As a result, Steam was not very popular during its early years.


That seems inconceivable these days what with how the industry operates. Nowadays, we probably couldn't imagine a world in which we can't instantly download a game or a much-needed patch, especially given the state some releases are in on launch day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Walters has announced on Twitter that his “new helicopter game from 1992,” Thunder Helix, is launching on Steam Early Access on March 21.


I’ve been keeping an eye on Thunder Helix for a while now. It’s a helicopter combat game made in the style of early PC flight sims. The style emulates the fractal landscapes used in pre-polygonal flight games, and goes as far as using a 256 color completely with pixel stippling. Although, the store blurb says it can also run at 16-bit color.


I didn’t play very many of those flight sims. I was a bit too young. I did play Dungeons & Dragons: Dragonstrike, and a friend once brought over A-10 Tank Killer. I can’t believe I remember that game.




Thunder Helix contains all the bells and whistles: multiple helicopters, day and night gameplay, a winch. Everything you could possibly want from helicopter flying. It also supports multiple control schemes, including flight joystick. Unfortunately, I think my Microsoft Sidewinder Precision 2 Joystick is packed up at my parents. I haven’t bought anything more modern.


I’m pretty jazzed. I could technically install a DOS flight sim right now, but whenever I do, I usually just struggle to get the controls working for a while and get tired. Something with a modern backend sounds pretty rad right now.


Thunder Helix will be out on PC via Steam Early Access on March 21.

Pyoro added to the retweet that "MAR10 Day falls on a Sunday this year but...", meaning that we could indeed be getting some news about the game very soon.

Now Top Gear and its sequel are back – though not by that name – in Top Racer Collection and while their return will no doubt be a joy for the grizzled veterans who remember it from back in the day, those discovering them for the first time may be better suited to the more modern equivalents which hold up a little better.

Over the weekend, developers Prophecy Games announced March 12th is the date, with the full launch to follow after up to a year. Prophecy are spun off from Hi-Rez Studios, the folks who who made Tribes: Ascend, which officially shut down a few years back. I hear this next one's pretty fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mounts are always a popular item in Final Fantasy XIV, whether they are rewarded for in-game content or purchased for real money in the Online Store. The latest addition to the store, the Crescent Moon Mount, is a particularly awaited one. 


We’ve known that this mount has been coming for a while and especially attentive players have noticed that it’s been included in the FFXIVCollect database for a few months. There had been speculation about whether this item would come in the form of a Seasonal Event reward, but those can now be laid to rest. 


The mount is, as the name suggests, a Crescent Moon draped in white fabric that glows in the dark and while riding it, you’ll be accompanied by a small Lopporit who sits beside you. The music is typical of Online Store mounts, playing the Palace of the Dead theme, otherwise known as the ‘Merry Wanderer’s Waltz’, as you glide through the skies. 


The description for the mount reads as follows:


“Designed in the likeness of a crescent moon, this magicked gondola was being kept in storage in Sharlayan, where it was classified as a gift. While its origin is undisclosed, the automaton that accompanies the contraption offers a telling clue. The trail of sparkles left in your wake will make you feel as though you're truly playing among the stars...”


The Crescent Moon Mount costs 24 USD and is thankfully account-wide, which means that you’ll only have to purchase it once and you’ll be able to use it with all existing characters, as well as any that you create in the future.

Developer melessthanthree and publisher Syndicate Atomic have announced that the surreal-looking action RPG Death of a Wish will hack and slash its way to Switch next week on 11th March.
One look at the above trailer gives a pretty good idea of just how trippy things are going to get in this one. In it, you will play as Christian, a young man with cursed powers who sets out across a nightmare world to take down the cult that raised him.

Halo: Flashpoint, a new skirmish game from Mantic Games, has given us our first glimpse of the Spartan miniatures that will make up the available forces at launch. The miniatures will be produced at 32mm scale, making them slightly larger than the standard 28mm that most companies have been going with for years now.

Details are still somewhat thin, but we do know that the game will launch as a Spartan vs. Spartan skirmish game this August. Thanks to the details in a news post on Mantic's own website, we can start to piece together some important parts of the Halo: Flashpoint puzzle.

What I find more interesting is that this launched with some official IRL Sims plumbob jewellery that you can buy and wear around your own precious, swan-like neck.

Elden Pixels has built a strong reputation for itself with its Alwa games, both offering a great take on the traditional Metroidvania formula, but its latest release tries to do something quite a bit different. A Void Hope certainly carries on some of the level design and exploration elements central to the studio’s previous releases, but here there’s much more focus on atmosphere, story, and horror. It doesn’t entirely stick the landing, but this is ultimately a worthwhile little project that we’d encourage you to consider.
A Void Hope follows the tale of Keegan and Glinda, a couple in a rocky patch of their relationship who find themselves dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic. People all over are becoming infected and losing their memories, eventually devolving into zombie-like creatures that sometimes transform into something decidedly less human.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. 


Players must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.

When it came to exploring The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's massive Hyrule, Ultrahand felt like a gift from Hylia herself. Why would you walk anywhere when you could build a hoverbike in seconds? A part of us wished that such a feature had always been around to help us traverse Link's previous trials. If only there was a mod where we could see how ridiculous that would look in, say, Ocarina of Time, eh?
Surprise! There is one! Modder notCHase has managed to recreate the handy building feature in the PC port of Ocarina of Time and the results are... kind of hilarious, if we're honest (thanks, Gaming Reinvented). Yes, the functions are a tad more basic than that which we find in TOTK (don't be expecting to see any Mechs), but, hey, it works.

A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.
Now, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.

The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. 


Or at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described "professional fraudster" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three people arrested in China last year for operating major piracy site B9Good have been sentenced by a local court. Foreign companies face significant obstacles when attempting to enforce their rights in China but here, anti-piracy group CODA, acting for major Japanese anime rightsholders, came up with a novel strategy. The convictions of a pirate site operator and two uploaders are the first ever obtained by foreign rightsholders inside China.

It's another relatively quiet week for big name PC releases - no mega-sequels or adaptations, unless you're seriously into the Moomins - but if 2024 has taught me anything it's that a breakout hit can come from anywhere, and I will accordingly be watching this week's new games with deep suspicion and barely constrained panic.

As of today, players can also enjoy one of these long, drawn-out narrative stealth games within the comfortable confines of Minecraft textures and flavor text. 


Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is, in my opinion, the greatest game in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. It added a manual camouflage system and on the fly medical treatments consisting of bugs, twigs, and whatever else is lying around in the jungle. Its plot perfectly sets up every other game in the series, and its gameplay manages to pull back the futuristic stealth tactics to a more grounded level that makes them feel incredibly tangible.

All Helldivers 2 players understand the pain of collecting Samples. While they're easy to spot and pick up, it's holding onto them that quickly becomes an issue as swarms of Terminid bugs or Automaton mechs overwhelm and kill them. Upon death, players drop everything they're holding, including those Samples, meaning they need to be gathered again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

I propose to you that there has not. Sewer levels are the worst. They have always been the worst, and will always be the worst. There is no redeeming feature that can make sewer levels good, fun or enjoyable, and I come to you today saying they must stop. No more sewer levels, developers. Please. I beg you. Especially you, Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster. You're the chief offender in this whole mess, and both my nostrils and my sanity simply cannot take it anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.
No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.
Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.]]></summary>

It's the game adorning our upcoming issue of Game Informer, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game's opening hour or so. 
In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game's first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon's pivot to this new genre.

Having now played the opening 90 minutes of the game ahead of tonight's Wicked Inside showcase, that initial excitement has settled into more of a 'Hoo boy, this thing is hard as nails. Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.' It's definitely verging on the edge of being just a teensy bit too punishing for my personal taste, but even though my arse got thoroughly whomped time and time again during this initial prologue section, there's still something about No Rest For The Wicked that's left me quietly captivated.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/01/crash-team-rumble-gets-final-content-update-next-week"/>
        <updated>2024-03-01T15:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game, is getting its final content update next week, less than a year after its launch. However, the game will still be available to play. 
Players who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.
Crash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game's support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it's nice that the game won't be disappearing for the time being (especially since it's quite fun), it's a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. 
We quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, "Crash Team Rumble's take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try." 


In related news, Toys for Bob announced that it's splitting from Activision Blizzard to go independent and potentially partner with Microsoft. You can read more about the studio's plans here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahhhh love is in the air. Or maybe it's the Mako...regardless, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is finally out on PlayStation 5 and that's something we can all celebrate. We had a great time with it – read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review here – and one of the many reasons we enjoyed our 80-plus hours playing is because of the various relationships within the game and Cloud's party. Whether you're Team Clerith or Team Clifa, or maybe Team Cloud XIII (is that a thing?), there's plenty that will leave you satisfied. 
Chief among those things is the special date night that happens within the Gold Saucer. We won't spoil when it happens in the game, and we won't discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member. That means we were able to take part in all possible dates at the Gold Saucer, and we captured each for you to watch below. 
Here's Every Gold Saucer Date In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth


For more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, and then check out our guide of the best side quests in the game. After that, check out our Queen's Blood tips and tricks (and our best deck build), and then read about how New Game Plus works in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. That's not all, though – we also have a ranking of every minigame and a segway showdown between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.
It’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.

Good for them, but maybe too late for some. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that it seemed Activision Blizzard were closing Toys For Bob's California headquarters and laying off 86 people. Still, the new independent Toys For Bob say they're working on something new and "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft.

Contrary to some reports, today's changes don't amount to a total ban on VPNs. Use of state approved VPNs, which do everything except the useful stuff, remain legal. The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen's to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Eidos-Montréal and Black Forest Games, is set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive, according to a new Bloomberg report. Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. 
Once the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. 


Bloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. 
Saber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTube has released a dedicated website for its copyright transparency report. The latest data show that automated copyright claims remain in favor and are rising rapidly. In the first half of 2023, YouTube processed 980 million Content ID claims, a 25% increase compared to a year earlier. By claiming videos this way, rightsholders generate billions in additional revenue.

This mechanical keyboard is more humble than its peers too, with a $30 asking price that is absolutely exceptional for a name-brand keyboard that gets rave reviews: the Keychron C3 Pro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have noticed that SSDs got extremely cheap towards the end of 2023, and then they rebounded somewhat in 2024. We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren't likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they're still well worth covering. 
The subject of today's deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024.

As you navigate a reality-bending doomsday loop, your vehicle is the only thing keeping you from impending death – if you're good enough at driving it. I've had fun in this world speeding through the forest and grabbing glowing yellow orbs, but the car is one of the most interesting parts to me for one reason: I don't have a driver's license yet.
After years of procrastination and two expired temporary permits, I've finally started learning to drive in earnest. I spent years of adulthood in the dark, and it's been fascinating to open my eyes to something that is an everyday experience for millions of people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys for Bob, the studio behind games like Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, has announced it is splitting from its owner Activision Blizzard to go independent. It is also exploring a partnership with Microsoft. 
Toys for Bob announced this in a statement released today, which explains why now is "the time to take the studio and our future games to the next level." 


Here's Toys for Bob's statement, in full: 
Toys for Bob did not disclose a price (if there is one) associated with its split from Activision Blizzard, which arrives just a few months after Microsoft purchased the company for a colossal $69 billion.
Toys for Bob joins another studio leaving the hands of its owner today: With a $500 million deal, Embracer Group has sold Saber Interactive to a group of private investors, as reported by Bloomberg. Kotaku is also reporting today that Gearbox, the makers of the Borderlands series, is looking to break away from Embracer Group as well. 
What kind of game do you hope Toys for Bob makes first? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

On this week's Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss this, as well as some of our favourite and least favourite deployments of the video game Easter egg. We also talk about what we've been playing this week (Nightingale; PowerWash Sim, natch) and visiting Scotland. Sadly neither of us got to go to the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience. But we both wish we could have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocket Rat Games co-founder John Guerra remembers the exact day he started working on Cobalt Core's first prototype. He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. "I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core," he tells me.
The pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, "we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall," he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had "a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but "Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre," says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, "you can kind of see how that went from A to B".

I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.
This is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the "you're about to be unemployed" language right there. The company is moving away from "the development of future licensed IP" and toward "our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities". Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer's count) must go.

Introduced early in Rebirth, Queen's Blood is an in-universe card game that seemingly everyone around Gaia's various continents plays, from Junon to Nibelheim and elsewhere. And after spending dozens of hours playing it, I can understand why - it rules. It's easily my favorite game-within-a-game ever, and one I hope spins out into its own thing in some form, be it a digital card game, a physical one, or something else. 
It can be a difficult game, thou…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is chock full of activities to do when you aren't controlling Cloud, chasing after Sephiroth, and trying to save the planet. With multiple open world zones to explore, there are dozens of objectives to complete ranging from Queen's Blood matches to treasure caches to combat challenges and more. It's safe to say completing everything Rebirth offers will take 100 or more hours, and that's before you add in dozens of minigames to the game's slew of offerings. 
With so much stuff to do, though, not everything sticks the landing and that goes for side quests too, which range from fine and forgettable to great. If you're looking to get the Platinum trophy, you'll need to complete every side quest, but if you're just trying to play through the game's best offerings, we h…]]></summary>

This includes the original Control game, its in-development sequel Control 2, the multiplayer spin-off Project Condor, and all future Control products.

I’m not a poker player. I’ve never learned the game, and my limited knowledge of it largely stems from pop culture osmosis, such as James Bond films and referential quips from X-Men’s Gambit. I couldn’t tell you what makes a Royal Flush, but I know it’s good to have it. Despite its premise and appearance, Balatro technically isn’t poker. It is, however, the first title to make me understand and enjoy the core premise of the card game. It also happens to be one of the most engrossing games of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could there be a more than universally relatable quote shared by indie developers than: "We really just wanted to make a small game"? Of course, there's little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.
Having said that, I’m not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, "something very fast". Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.

There might be fun in some of its slower moments, but some of the generally positive, "It's actually quite a good game!" takes that I've seen honestly baffle me. The game is a series of long, annoying journeys, during which the most fun I had was turning my head to watch Catfish on my other monitor. MTV's show about people getting duped online was the perfect sailing companion, and perhaps, one of the only reasons I survived my brush with the live service seas.

It could cover the entire scene with banana peels, however.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago on a desktop far, far away, my family once owned a demo disc for the original Star Wars: Dark Forces. I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).
Crucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetEase Games has pulled back the curtains on its newest studio, BulletFarm. Led by David Vonderhaar, whose experience includes leading the teams behind the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, BulletFarm aims to develop a new triple-A game that utilizes first-person gameplay with an emphasis on co-op in Unreal Engine 5. It will be set in an original universe. 
This unannounced and untitled game will "craft a more intimate and relatable experience while offering a fresh take on first-person gameplay," according to a press release. 
BulletFarm is taking a remote-first approach to game development but considers itself a triple-A studio headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Joining Vonderhaar is the studio's creative director Chris Cowell. The studio is currently looking to hire in various roles to fill out the founding team. 

"Starting this new studio has given me a chance to step out of my comfort zone and try my hand at making something entirely new and different," Vonderhaar writes in a press release. "This is a departure from the games I've worked on, but one that showcases my passion for rich characters, precise mechanics, more intimate storytelling, and plenty of action. NetEase has provided us an incredible support structure to explore these new avenues and allow true freedom to begin building the concept and ideas for our game." 
NetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu says the company is fully dedicated to giving BulletFarm the resources and support it requires to build its new first-person experience. "David's leadership and the early collection of game development talent assembled at the studio is set to offer something truly unique for his existing fans along with a new audience." 
BulletFarm is currently developing its first title, but there's no word on when to expect to see it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hell(o), bellowing caped stooges of Super Earth! It's time for another Helldivers 2 patch. This one makes some heroic adjustments to the shooter's generally inoffensive microtransaction system, targetting a technical issue whereby Super Credits and Premium Warbonds would not show up after purchase. Huzzah! Developers Arrowhead have also nuked a rather barmy Helldivers 2 glitch that allowed for unlimited stratagem use with no cooldowns following an AFK kick.

The developers, Eleventh Hour Games say they're "going to have a heavy emphasis on expanding end-game content". But first, yes, more fixes and improvements to the servers which suffered and stumbled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DarkStone Digital, solo developer of The Mortary Assistant, is making a new horror game based on Paramount's Paranormal Activity films. Titled Paranormal Activity: Found Footage, it's being published by DreadXP and features some kind of reactive haunt system, with scares dialling up and down based on your actions. DreadXP have shared a teaser consisting of some crackly logos against a backdrop of radio chatter. Given that this is a Paranormal Activity adaptation, it's possible the trailer harbours spooky secrets. You may wish to experiment with turning the brightness up and down, playing the video backwards, or watching it again at the next full moon, perhaps while standing in a cemetery loudly declaring that ghosts aren't real.

        <updated>2024-02-27T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.
According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. 
NEW: As part of today's mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.
https://t.co/pvCDsS7yxe
February 27, 2024
Twisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. 
The number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood & Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it's among several titles getting the axe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game based on the Paranormal Activity film franchise has been announced. Developed by Darkstone Digital, makers of the 2022 horror game The Mortuary Assistant, along with publisher DreadXP and Paramount Pictures, the upcoming game is slated to release in 2026. 
Like the films, Paranormal Activity will feature found-footage-style gameplay as well as a “Haunt System,” which dynamically changes the types of scares that unfold based on players’ actions. Unfortunately, a brief teaser trailer doesn’t do much but show some logos, so we may be waiting a while to see the game in action. 


“We are thrilled to work with Paramount Game Studios and to have the opportunity to bring the world of Paranormal Activity to gamers everywhere,” said Epic Pictures CEO and DreadXP producer Patrick Ewald in a press release. “The films are steeped in rich lore and creative scares, and under the stewardship of creative director Brian Clarke, DreadXP’s Paranormal Activity video game will honor those core tenets and offer horror fans one of our most terrifying games yet.”
Paranormal Activity has no announced platforms. It’s not the franchise’s first foray into video games. A 2017 game called Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul was released for PS4 and PC and was playable in VR.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After recently revealing the full launch roster for WWE 2K24, we now know the superstars arriving post-launch. 2K has revealed the five DLC packs rolling out throughout the year, and they include the Best in the World, one of the biggest female superstar signings in recent memory, and even a Grammy-nominated recording artist. 
CM Punk headlines this DLC roster, marking his first appearance in a WWE game since WWE 2K15 in 2014 (the year he walked out of the company). It would appear the Voice of the Voiceless’ recent social media campaign to be included in the 2K24’s DLC plans paid off faster than expected, and he’s part of the first pack, no less. I smell a work, but it’s good to have him back in an official in-game capacity, regardless.
Other big highlights include Jade Cargill, Pat McAfee, and 2K24 soundtrack curator and award-winning music artist Post Malone. Check out the full list of superstars in each pack below.

Such a weak title deserves a much worse game, but this captures the feeling of its late 90s FPS influences as they actually were, and ends up just familiar enough to work, and just original enough to refresh the formula. At times, it's a little too accurate, but even with its annoyances dialled up by the pressure of playing it too hard for the sake of review, I'm impressed with the balancing act it's struck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day, another videogame company jettisoning a large number of people "who have contributed to our success" so as to position themselves for growth in the face of "challenging times". Today it's Sony's turn with the axe: the PlayStation publisher have announced plans to reduce their global workforce by about 8% or 900 people, so as "to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what lies ahead", in the words of outgoing president and CEO Jim Ryan.
Several well-known PlayStation studios are affected, including The Last Of Us developer Naughty Dog, Ratchet & Clank developer Insomniac Games, Horizon developer Guerilla Games and PlayStation VR specialists Firesprite. It's also proposed that PlayStation close Sony London in their entirety, though the exact scale of the reductions remains to be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the main headline event from today's Pokémon Presents showcase was the announcement of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it wasn't the only new game that got announced. It shares that status with Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket, a new mobile game that allows players to collect, trade, and battle with the franchise's signature trading cards.
Check out the reveal trailer below:


While there are several features available in the game, Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket seems to focus the most on the collection aspect, which is fitting given the renaissance of physical card games in recent years. While no details on microtransactions are given, the end of the trailer notes that players will get two free packs a day – implying that more than that might come at a cost.
You'll also be able to trade cards with other players and battle them online as well. The trailer also shows off immersive cards, which seem to feature a 3D cinematic inside the cards.
The app is being developed by DeNA (best known for their work on Pokémon Masters) and is due out sometime later this year. For more Pokémon cards, check out our Trading Card hub, which features some of our favorite pulls from the game's big releases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced layoffs at various PlayStation first-party studios, including Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us Part II), Guerrilla Games (Horizon Forbidden West), and Firesprite. It is also closing London Studio, the team behind PlayStation VR's Blood & Truth and VR Worlds. In a statement released by head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst, he seems to cite overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs. 
PlayStation's Technology, Creative, and Support teams are also affected by these layoffs, according to Hulst. He writes, "These are in addition to some smaller reductions in other teams across PlayStation Studios." These layoffs will result in an 8 percent reduction of staff, or around 900 people losing their jobs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Pokémon Presents stream celebrating Pokémon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It's not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it's an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.
Check out some images from the trailer below:

The teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it's not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words "urban redevelopment plan." This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Other than the teaser, details are scarce. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo's Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pokémon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called "a worthwhile spin-off adventure."

With a June release now confirmed for Shadow Of The Erdtree, the long-awaited expansion, director Hidetaka Miyazaki has now hinted that we Tarnished may have missed something. One small secret may yet remain, assuming he's not pulling another prank, or maybe not. Honestly, Miyazaki should say it has hundreds of undiscovered things. Keep everyone guessing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night I dreamt I had to review a Dragon Age DLC. I reviewed it poorly. I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.
I'm worried about Dragon Age. I'm worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it'll end up kind of a mess. But that's the pessimism talking. What I'd like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon's (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.

Happily, publishers Binary Haze Interactive have now confirmed that Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist is, in fact, coming to PC (and other consoles) after all, and that it's coming real soon, as its PC early access release has been set for just weeks away on March 25th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Ever since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever’s trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”
Sunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”

However, it wasn’t until its 2019 release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, that the developer’s name became synonymous with “you should play this team’s games.” It’s hard to tell what, exactly, made 13 Sentinels the breakout title for Vanillaware, shipping more than 1 million copies worldwide as of August last year, making it the studio’s best-selling title. The easy answer is probably its beloved story, both in how it plays out and how it’s infused into the game’s real-time strategy mech combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last week’s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it's hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26. 
Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game's new trailer below.


Like Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.
While it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game's benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.]]></summary>

While Uematsu didn’t rule out creating the main themes for future games, he said that his days of scoring an entire game are likely over - leaving his last complete soundtrack as the OST for mobile-exclusive RPG Fantasian.

The publication reports that 150 staff members at the British studio were informed today they are "at risk" of being laid off in accordance with U.K. labor laws that require companies to give notice ahead of layoffs. 
Shortly after Bloomberg's report went live, the studio tweeted the following statement:

On Saturday, at least one Cloudflare IP address was added to the Piracy Shield anti-piracy system. According to an expert, that ended up blocking a large number of websites, including a charity, a telecoms company, and several schools. It's the outcome many people predicted but one that could've been easily avoided.

The news was revealed by the head of AGCOM and local anti-piracy group FAPAV, who also addressed media reports that overblocking is already affecting innocent parties. Those media reports, published by reputable outlets, were dismissed as "fake news." In reality, the claim that Piracy Shield is "working perfectly" isn't just fake, it's pure propaganda.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.
