        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Virtual Insanity
Sega legend Yu Suzuki has announced that he is teaming with metaverse company OASYX to create a collection of NFTs based upon his legendary fighting series, Virtua Fighter. The dreadful idea is expected to be the first step in a series of metaverse projects for the iconic game director.
A total of 1000 NFTs are currently in the works, debasing the likenesses of 11 Virtua Fighters from the first three releases in the series, (so we at least know that Eileen is safe, for now). The new range of NFTs is expected to form the base for a future release of further "metaverse avatars"
"During my time as a director at Sega, I initially developed Virtua Fighter using innovative 3D computer graphics technology, which was cutting-edge and industry-leading at the time," said Suzuki in a statement. "Since then, the Virtua Fighter series has grown to be loved by many players and continues to be supported by numerous fans today."
"Through my work supervising the development of OASYX’s unique worldview, I am delighted to combine innovative technology in the form of blockchain-based NFTs, with three titles from the Virtua Fighter series to create new entertainment for a wide range of gaming fans."
Sega has been practically salivating at the prospect of diving into the metaverse, while simultaneously attempting to assure fans that it is wary of the controversial blockchain technology. As is the case with many other toe-dippers in recent months, both Sega and Suzuki seem completely unperturbed by the market's inability to find consistent success, demonstrated by the complete collapse of cryptocurrency company FTX, the embarrassment of Meta, the dropping Google Search numbers, or fan anger displayed towards Ubisoft, Square Enix, and other studios getting on board the rocket to nowheresville.

Unusual video game adverts aren't uncommon, but more and more we see product placements and advertisements for other items that use video games. But an ad for Rohto eye drops in Japan has caught people's attention because the whole commercial uses edited Street Fighter II footage. (Thanks for the tip, GreatSong1!)
Posted on Twitter by the company (via EventHubs and Time Extension), the advert is equal parts bizarre and impressive. It features Ryu and Dhalsim towards the end of a bout, both struggling to stay on their feet with a sliver of health left. Then, both characters hold up a packet of eye drops, and use them by executing an attack — each getting their own very cool cut-in in the process. The commercial ends with both characters getting KO'd at the same time, joyous and relieved that their eyes feel better.

Lululu Entertainment has revealed their next game, Henry Halfhead. This sandbox puzzle game is looking to release next year.
Casting you as the titular half-headed Henry, Henry Halfhead gives you the ability to possess objects. The trailer demonstrates Henry possessing a pair of safety scissors to slice up an apple, which is impressive. I could never even cut craft paper with those. My second thought is wondering if I could jam those scissors into an electrical socket.
https://youtu.be/_tQWiIscf34
Henry Halfhead will have you play out the life of a person with only half a head, from making your bed in the morning to (I presume) feeding the ducks on a park bench. You expand and unlock new levels by solving puzzles and interacting with objects. The developer is touting over 150 interactive objects that you can tinker around with. There’s also a co-op mode, if you’d like to partner with your other half. Oh, and you can also put hats on Henry, which is pretty key.
Lululu Entertainment (I’m glad I’m just writing that and not saying it out loud) has only developed one game previous to this, the competitive, stick-flinging title Bamerang. Henry Halfhead is quite the departure from that style, but from the looks of things, it’s shaping up pretty well. It’s hard not to dig the crisp visual style they’re showing off.
Currently, PC is the only announced platform for Henry Halfhead. It’s set to release within the wide window of 2024.

The latest UK Charts data is in (after a short delay) and it showcases an impressive performance from Nintendo's premiere 3D platformer, Super Mario Odyssey, which sneaks back into the top ten after settling in at position twenty-six just two weeks ago. The game was recently released as part of a new 'MAR10 Day' Switch bundle and has also been subject to some minor price discounts at multiple retail outlets.
Elsewhere, the only newcomer in the top ten this week is WWE 2K23 for PlayStation 4/5 and Xbox Series X/S, which debuted at the number one spot, knocking Hogwarts Legacy down from its perch after five weeks on the top spot. Metroid Prime Remastered, meanwhile, is still chilling out in the top ten at number five this week, slipping down just one position from last week.

Using a selection of creative tools that are still available on the 3DS eShop at the time of writing, Walt Disney Animation Studios animator Wayne Unten has created an incredible short as a tribute to the console and its software.
Wayne got in touch with us recently to nominate those apps he used for our Countdown series (look out for that later today), but we felt this fantastic 30-second short (below) — titled Toadal Disaster — deserved to be showcased separately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nice of the Aliens to wait their turn
Focus Entertainment has announced that Aliens: Dark Descent, a new video game adaptation of the terrifying sci-fi series, will officially launch June 20 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The new game, which was first announced during Summer Game Fest 2022, will see a squad of hardened marines taking on an infestation on the dark planet, Moon Lethe. Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time strategy title and will task the player with efficiently equipping, maneuvering, and affording their troops with the tactical advantage over hordes of Warriors, Face Huggers, Queens, and, of course, the soul-sucking capitalism of Weyland-Yutani. XCOM in the Alien universe? Eh, more or less.
You can check out a new trailer below, courtesy of IGN.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YilVs3-B42k&ab_channel=IGN
As the trailer spotlights, Dark Descent is not just another bug hunt, as players will also have to ensure that their squad is well-trained, well-maintained, and afforded some of the greatest weaponry that researchers can provide. The Xenomorphs will almost always have the speed and number advantage, so the marines will have to play the field a little wiser — setting up traps, pinpointing enemy movement, and heading into battle well-equipped for the nightmare that lies ahead.
As we all know, the Alien franchise has had a real rollercoaster ride when it comes to video games, but I think the visuals here are looking pretty authentic, and it will be great to head into the acid-dripping universe from a perspective that isn't first-person. There's no sign of Lt. Vasquez, or Lynn Kurosawa for that matter, but this new take looks promising, and here's hoping that it delivers come June.
But besides all of that, I only need to know one thing... Where they are.

As someone who spent much of the late 2000s deep in the RPG Maker community, I can’t believe how far the engine has come. RPG Maker is typically associated with low-quality Final Fantasy knockoffs, but funny enough, it’s the non-RPGs that became breakout hits. To The Moon set the stage for narrative RPG Maker games that are worth both time and money, and Laura Shigihara’s Rakuen follows in that proud tradition. Given Shigihara's involvement with the former project, this shouldn't come as a surprise.
Of course, this is old news by now. Rakuen originally released in 2017 to critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. Sporting an Overwhelmingly Positive consensus on Steam, words like “beautiful” and “masterpiece” typically describe this title in reviews. Now, …]]></summary>

It's hard to argue that Bub and Bob aren't the most adorable video game dinosaurs of all time (sorry, Yoshi), so we were delighted when the dynamic duo returned with the Switch-exclusive Bubble Bobble 4 Friends back in 2019. It was exactly as we remembered their pixels back in the dusty halls of the arcade growing up, just a little cuddlier.
But it reminded us of another arm of Taito's bubble-trapping series that we dearly missed — Puzzle Bobble, also known as Bust-A-Move. This spin-off series swapped bubble traps for bubble bursting and turned the platforming duo into puzzle masters. Clearing bubbles was the name of the game, and this spin-off series is arguably as well-known as Taito's original dino arcade classic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings "Blocky" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing a short snippet of Tchia back in January for a preview, I had complete faith that developers Awaceb would deliver on their promises for their open-world adventure. Tchia’s island is a marvel to behold. Not only is it gorgeous, but it’s bursting with things to do: sailing, climbing, totem carving, gliding, pearl diving, sharpshooting, tree hopping, treasure hunting - the list goes on and on. 
Not only that, but there’s a 10-hour story to follow, quests to complete, and baddies to tussle with. It's a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game's incredible scope doesn't feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We've had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I'm more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.

Publisher XSEED Games is bringing the adorable-looking Melon Journey: Bittersweet Memories to Switch on 6th April 2023, and it looks like a long-lost Game Boy game.
Developed by Froach Club as a sequel to its 2012 itch.io title, Melon Journey, your adventure takes place in a small, cosy village known as Hog Town, where melons are illegal — yes, melons. As the bunny Honeydew, you get caught up in the town's mysteries, quirky characters, and strange events while you search for your missing best friend.

You might remember the retail sim as the monochromatic indie from 2010 about three street vendors who struggle to make ends meet. It was a kind of precursor to Papers, Please, and despite critical acclaim and big wins at IGF, Cart Life’s creator Richard Hofmeier removed the game from Steam almost a decade ago - instead opting to release the source code for free.

The newest Peppa Pig game, Peppa Pig: World Adventures, has taken a lot of people by surprise by including a rather sudden tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away in September last year.
The moment was spotted and shared on Twitter by Twitch streamer Ray Narvaez Jr. (thanks, Kotaku), who has been playing the game. Peppa Pig: World Adventures sees you, as the titular piglet, travel around the world and visit various different cities with your friends and family. On day five, you go to London. Peppa and her family visit Buckingham Palace and meet Queen Elizabeth II, who takes them on a tour around the city in a double-decker bus.

However, we're missing the fifth place NAND flash memory manufacturer, another brand that creates their own flash memory and controllers: SK Hynix, or as their consumer brand is labelled, Solidigm (meant to rhyme with paradigm for some reason). 
I recently upgraded a laptop I'm testing with their P44 Pro 1TB drive, and I've been thrilled with its performance - and now, this drive has hit a scorchingly hot price on Amazon US. You can now pick up this drive for just $69.99 after a 44% discount from its US MSRP of $124.99, an incredible price for a high-end PCIe 4.0 drive.

Kingdom Eighties: Summer of Greed is the newest entry in the Kingdom micro-strategy series. Teased last year, publisher Raw Fury has now revealed that the game will be coming to consoles — including Switch — sometime in 2023.

Donning a neon eighties vibe and a retro aesthetic, complete with catchy synth tunes, Kingdom Eighties is a standalone title and a love letter to summer camp, Saturday morning cartoons, and the best movies of the decade.

2K Games, in association with The LEGO Company, released a teaser trailer for its first game in its new collaboration partnership — The arcade racer based upon the timeless toy will receive its official reveal this Thursday, March 23.
The fun teaser for the teaser, which you can check out below, introduces us to Awesome News Network reporter Vikki Wheeler, who puts the brakes on the announcement trailer, telling viewers that they'll have to tune in on Thursday for the full reveal. Interestingly, there's a really obvious cut right before she says the name of the game, clearly a last-minute decision not to reveal the title just yet — though multiple rumors from a variety of sources suggest that the game may be named "LEGO 2K Drive".
Worryingly, I think I fancy Vikki Wheeler, but then I'm yet to have my morning coffee.
https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1637861866931118089?s=20
The new title is the first release in what is expected to be a multi-game partnership between LEGO and 2K Games, with the latter hoping to appeal to both younger and more casual audiences with a series of sports titles based around the block-building pastime. Given that 2K games owns numerous athletic licenses, I'm interested to see if there are plans on the table for LEGO NHL 2K, LEGO NBA 2K, or, best of all, LEGO WWE 2K.
We'll be sure to bring you all the news from Thursday's reveal right here on Destructoid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Time to Shrine".
With The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom barrelling towards its May 12th, 2023 release date, Nintendo has thought it prudent to allow everyone to download the Explorer's Guide for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
Originally released as part of the 'Explorer's Edition' bundle, the guide is essentially a glorified instruction manual for what is effectively a six-year-old game at this point, but with 94 pages (well, nearly... pages 73-84 have been omitted) stuffed with information on gameplay mechanics and the world of Hyrule, it will nevertheless prove interesting for both newcomers and veterans alike. Plus, it's free, y'know?

The online free-to-play battle royale Apex Legends has been going since 2019 and was only released on the Switch in 2021, but the general aim is to keep the franchise around for a very long time.
In an interview with our friends at GamesIndustry.biz, the game's director Steven Ferreira mentioned how the team was in it for the "long haul" - with an aim to keep the IP going for possibly 15 "or more" years.

Last year, I stated that WWE 2K22 wasn’t so much “a step in the right direction,” but rather that it “picked itself off, dusted itself off, and went right back to the philosophy that it was following before.” This isn’t so much a condemnation. WWE 2K20 sank the series to new depths, and a course correction was needed. However, after I did the review of WWE 2K22, a patch was released by 2K Sports that corrupted my save data and made Universe Mode inaccessible. This was a commonly reported problem that never got fixed. You just had to delete your save data, start over, and hope the same thing happened.
However, with WWE 2K22 dead to me, I had high hopes for WWE 2K23 because the bar was still set extremely low. Thankfully, despite all my trepidation, it managed to step over i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No way home
Respawn and Electronic Arts have shared the latest trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, with a spotlight on the story. And it seems like a rough road ahead for Cal and pals.
Survivor takes place five years after the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, with Cal now searching for a safe haven. He might be a more powerful Jedi than ever before, but the Empire doesn't seem too happy to let the conflict lie.
Today's trailer shows Cal fighting even more Empire troops, with some intimidating foes showing up. But Kestis also looks like he'll have a bit more help around this time, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F6YBwIPzmk
Alongside some new faces, we do catch one familiar one sporting a new look. As Respawn confirms, Merrin is returning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, with a new style and apparently assisting Cal in thinning out the Empire's ranks.
A place beyond the stars
When it landed in 2019, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a bit of a surprise. A single-player, action-adventure Star Wars game from the studio that had, up to that point, worked on games like Titanfall and Apex Legends, with God of War's Stig Asmussen on to direct.
The result really worked though, as it received a positive critical reception and sold enough to make EA happy. Even as someone a little bit jaded with current Star Wars, I enjoyed the mobility and tense lightsaber action. It's nice to see some of that action still at the fore in this latest Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer.
I'm definitely curious to see if Respawn can bottle (Force) lightning twice. And boy, has this release date snuck up on me, too. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on April 28.

There's a prevailing modern philosophy in action game design that says that the controller should "disappear." You should feel like you're doing something when you press a button and the character on the screen responds. You should map "looking around" and "walking" to two different sticks because we look around and walk at the same time. You should put "shoot" on a trigger because it feels a bit like pulling the trigger on a gun. You should not have your character stop in place every time they ready their gun, because holding a gun does not incapacitate the legs.
And yet, Resident Evil 4, among the most celebrated action games ever made, breaks every one of these rules. It constantly emphasizes the break between the player and the character. The presence of the co…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apex Legends continues to grow, and so does Respawn
Respawn is opening a new branch in Madison, Wisconsin, the company announced today. This latest addition may work on other projects in the future, but at least right now, it will be focusing on supporting Apex Legends.
Former Epic games director of engine production Ryan Burnett is taking up the role of studio director. He also had 14 years with Raven Software. The Madison branch is working closely with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation as well, to help grow the studio.
Respawn opened a support studio for Apex Legends in Vancouver back in 2019. With this new studio, it sounds like Electronic Arts and Respawn want to keep the battle royale growing. From a GamesIndustry.biz interview with the new studio leads, Burnett says that the branch is not a remote live ops department, but an expansion of the core Apex team that will work with the studios in LA and Vancouver.
The battle rages on
Three locales is a lot, but it sounds like Respawn has big plans for Apex Legends, especially when it comes to longevity. Responding to a question about crunch and quality-of-life, game director Steven Ferreira talks about just how long-haul the development of Apex goes.
"Team health is absolutely a top priority for us because we're in this for the long haul," Ferreira said. "We believe in Apex as a franchise that's going to be around for 10, 15 years or more and we're excited to make that happen. In order to do that, we can't just put everything all upfront, burn ourselves out and not be ready to do that in the long haul."
That's a long time, but as online game after online game has closed, Apex Legends has indeed weathered the storm. Maybe this battle royale does have a long future ahead of it. God willing, that will include some more Titanfall somewhere down the line.

Capcom, a studio that is on something of a roll in recent years, is reaching out to the player community for a new user survey, asking questions about the fans' opinions on its recent and upcoming games and services.
The survey, which you can take right here, is open until Wednesday, March 22, and features questions mainly related to Capcom's upcoming releases. The survey asks for your age and location, as well as the titles that you are looking forward to, as well as your spending habits in regard to sales and discounts. You do not need to input your email address or online identity. At the end of the survey, you can download the wallpaper featured in the header for PC and mobile in various resolutions.
Capcom — following on from the fallovers of Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite and the abominable Street Fighter V launch — has severely turned its fortunes around, releasing stellar games such as Monster Hunter: World, Devil May Cry V, Resident Evil Village, as well as great compilations including Capcom Arcade Stadium and Capcom Fighting Collection. With Resident Evil 4, Street Fighter 6, Exoprimal, and the mysterious Pragmata waiting in the wings, the long-time developer is looking to keep its success streak running in 2023 and beyond.

There was a time, long ago, when games were done when they hit retail shelves. But we're in the 21st century now, and more often than not, additional post-launch content is released months after a developer's main game is complete, enriching the experience.
There are tons of games that get DLC, Expansions, and Season Passes nowadays. These can range from cosmetic changes and updates to a whole new roster of characters to an entirely new story campaign. The Switch's library of games, and the eShop, are certainly no strangers to these extensions. Sometimes, they come years after the game has been released and take us by complete surprise — looking at your Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

I misguidedly came into Tchia thinking it would be a lighthearted jaunt, something along the lines of Lil’ Gator Game or Alba: A Wildlife Adventure. To be fair, everything about this game screams "summer vacation". The island setting is marvelous and bright, the exact kind of setting I could use right now, having been trapped in a perpetual winter for the last three months. Its eponymous hero is the type of laid-back person I strive to be on holiday, eating delicious-looking food while chilling by the campfire with her ukulele in hand. That, to me, sounds like the perfect island getaway...
...but this journey would be no trip to Sandals.

It was a time of great stress and uncertainty as the Covid-19 pandemic rapidly upended the lives of millions of people, with governments announcing nationwide lockdowns, businesses shutting down left, right, and centre, and the public forming orderly queues just to get into their local grocery store.
For those who play video games, there's one title in particular (well, two if you include DOOM Eternal) that dominated the conversation during 2020 and will be mentioned in reverance years from now thanks to its profoundly positive impact during such grim times, and that's Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

It uses QLC flash in a DRAM-less design, but with HMB technology - so it uses your computer's RAM as its cache. That allows it to provide surprisingly excellent performance, although we'd still recommend a higher-end TLC drive with a DRAM cache for the most intensive workloads, like 4K video production. For gaming and regular use though, this is a great choice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cal Kestis’ desperate fight against the Empire is the centerpiece of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and a new story trailer provides a peek into his struggle as well as the allies, old and new, helping him. 
The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years' worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monoghan.]]></summary>

Life by You is an open-world life simulator that looks to move in on The Sims territory. You create your families, design their houses, and dictate their lives. That’s pretty much The Sims, but Paradox Tectonic is trying to differentiate Life by You in quite a few ways. The most disturbing to me is that conversation will be held using real language rather than the gibberish Simlish utilized in Maxis’ legendary series. Outlined is a conversation …]]></summary>

It's a tiny bit like a Stardew Valley or Gleaner Heights, or any of those "do chores until you run out of energy" games, but mostly it's a "hanging out and being slightly weird" game.

Wonderful news for fans of the Atelier series, as Koei Tecmo has revealed that a new anime adaptation of Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout is currently in production inc collaboration with Aniplex. The new TV series is expected to premiere in Japan this coming summer.
Not much was offered in the way of detail about the anime, but it is confirmed to be a straight adaptation of the 2019 video game, which saw young hero Reisalin Stout — more commonly known as "Ryza", embark upon a country-crossing series of adventures with her friends, where they become embroiled in a world of magic, alchemy, and monsters. The anime is being produced by studio Liden Films, who have a proven pedigree in adapting games and manga to the medium of animation.

Koei Tecmo and Aniplex announced that more details about the series will be revealed at the dramatically titled "Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key Launch and Anime Adapation!" event, which is scheduled to take place this Sunday at the Anime Japan 2023 expo. As you can see from the teaser trailer above, the new anime features some wonderful lineart and animation, even if the camera is a tad on the shameless side.
It's a very promising look at what will no doubt be an eagerly anticipated show for the Atelier faithful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Software celebrated the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring last month and now, publisher Bandai Namco has released some fun statistics covering what players have done in 365 days of Elden Ring. 
Starting with the least surprising statistic, players have attempted to defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella, a colossal 329 million times. In second place, players have attempted to beat Margit the Fell Omen 281 million times. In third, Limgrave Tree Sentinel 277 million times, Radagon of the Golden Order in fourth at 148 million, and in fifth, Starscourge Radahn at 139 million. Across all bosses in Elden Ring, players have initiated 5.9 billion attempts. 
If you enjoyed those stats, there are all kinds of other ones in the infographic below – enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I mean their characters, obviously)
FromSoftware's stellar, (and stellar-selling), release Elden Ring is now a little over one year old, and publisher Bandai Namco has released a new infographic detailing the adventures, escapades and many, many deaths suffered by players at the hands of Malenia, Margit, Limgrave, and the other deadly denizens of The Lands Between.
Since launch, there have been over nine billion player deaths in the famously challenging RPG. 69% of these were at the hands of enemies, while the remaining demises are divided between long falls, status effects, or on the blade of other players, (though the latter only counts for a measly 2%. Players have started 5.9 billion boss battles, with 329 million players foolishly standing up to Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
When it comes to battle plans, the most popular spell cast is Rock Sling, followed up by Crystal Torrent, and then Glintstone Pebble. In regard to incantations, Blessing of the Erdtree is the most acquired variant, with Bestial Sting and Golden Vow close behind. One billion summons have been called into battle, with 88% of these being instances of co-op. It seems that people certainly aren't too shy about asking for a helping hand.
As I'm sure you don't need me to tell you, Elden Ring was also not only the best-selling game of 2022, but also walked away with an abundance of Game of the Year awards, (including our own), and is still one of today's most played games, 13 months on from release. There is more adventure en route, with expansion DLC Shadow of the Erdtree currently in development, though there is currently no release date.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remake of Resident Evil 4 is finally out this week and ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on the game. 
In it, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy attempt to get through the curiously adorable Spanish village that serves as the setting to RE4's opening while searching for the missing daughter of the president, Ashley Graham. Things don't go according to plan for Leon, unfortunately, and well, you can see what happens for yourself in the anime short below: 


Let's hope our own journeys through RE4 go better than Leon's did in the short above. 
Resident Evil 4 (remake) hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this Thursday, on March 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flipping blocks and birds
Team Meat has lifted the lid on a brand new title set within the Super Meat Boy universe — Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine is a brand new Match-4 puzzler currently in the works for PC and console platforms, with an expected launch window of 2023.
The new title, a clear pun on the 1993 Puyo Puyo reskin Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, will similarly task players with clearing out a playfield of familiar Super Meat Boy iconography against a strict time limit. As new sets of characters drop onto the playing area, the player will have to use efficient forward-playing to match up the icons with the brethren, clearing out space while setting up the remaining characters for smart, chain-reaction results down the line. In addition, the playfield will feature its own set of hazards, including rockets, pendulums, and those oh-so-pesky buzzsaws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAWZ14r93EU&ab_channel=PlayStation
Developed in cooperation with Team Meat and the original SMB artists, Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine will feature over 100 levels of "one-of-a-kind" gameplay, packed out with elements of the seminal 2010 release Super Meat Boy and the... not-so-seminal 2020 sequel Super Meat Boy Forever. A soundtrack by the returning RIDICULON will feature both new a new score as well as remixes of the popular and memorable soundtracks from the original games. Of course, everything will be splattered with the grotesque humor and strange, twisted aesthetic that helped make the original game such an incredible success story.
Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine is coming to PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zack Snyder, the director behind "Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice," "Man of Steel," and more, has revealed that his upcoming Netflix movie, "Rebel Moon," is getting the game treatment. 
Snyder told The Nerd Queens podcast this alongside word that he was helping with the development of the game, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a "ridiculous scale." 
"The one thing that I'm having a really good time with – and I don't really know if I'm supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we're doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge," he said on the podcast, according to VGC. "There's more coming, but all I'll say is that it was pitched to me – because I've always wanted to do an RPG – like, 'well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.'
"And I was like, 'ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.'"
Snyder says the team behind the RPG said, "Well, it's going to take so much time, we've got to do all these brain dumps, you've got to tell us everything in the universe, what's happening, the science." And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, "Let's go all the way." 
Snyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. 
In the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin's Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too).

No, I haven’t gone all Alan Moore and grimoired up a demonic pal to go gallivanting around the big Tescos with. That is next weekend. Instead, I’ve been playing Diablo 4’s beta, closed to all except an elite cadre of press, pre-orderers, and, uh, chicken enthusiasts. And so, axe in hand, I set forth, confident that whoever I found myself temporarily adventuring with would at least be fortified with adequate protein to wield rippling gains against the lords of hell.


Mouse-clicking connoisseurs of a certain age may remember a time when the name Blizzard was synonymous with the most gorgeously impressive CGI cutscenes your tiny mind had ever been blown by, and while Diablo 4’s lengthy introduction comes at a time where there’s far too much widespread talent for any one studio to claim that crown, it is still a goshdarn treat to take in. Not just technically, either. This chronicle of a cursed expedition is a mission statement for Diablo’s new (old) tone, and it sets the scene for things to come spectacularly - even if that tone straddles the line between gripping and noticeably self-concious about past accusations of cartooniness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axe you nicely
As we near the launch of Resident Evil 4, Capcom has released the first episode in a series of (very) short anime (mis)adventures detailing the events of one Leon Kennedy and his journey through the strange, European countryside — For your approval: Leon and the Mysterious Village.
Produced by Nippon Animation and stylized in a colorful & sunny style, not unlike the cheery work of Hayao Miyazaki and classic "globalized" anime shows of the '80s, episode one "Looking for Ashley" sees Leon stumble across a strange town occupied by a party of friendly locals. It works out incredibly well for our young hero, as you can imagine. But why waste your time reading about it when you could simply be watching it. Are you sitting comfortably?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lppo5cNxrhk&ab_channel=capcomasia
It would be a safe assumption that we will see other anime shorts during the Resident Evil 4 launch period, and nobody would blame you for having the strange feeling that we've been here before. In one of the best marketing campaigns in gaming history, Capcom supported the launch of 2021's Resident Evil Village with a delightful series of shorts featuring puppet variations of that game's main villains. (And boy, I really miss those puppets). Clearly, Capcom has decided that the "creepy cute" aesthetic is the way to go when it comes to promoting its flagship survival horror franchise.
We'll be sure to post all of the Leon and the Mysterious Village episodes here on Destructoid as they premiere. Resident Evil 4 launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Hey Yo, friends and well-wishers, and thanks for showing out for Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that this week has been a fine one, and that the weekend will be equally filled with mirth and merriment. I've found that my weekends have been speeding by far too quickly. One moment I'm buying my Saturday donut, and the next I'm grumbling out of bed on Monday morning. I think the key to prolonging the weekend is to do as much as possible as soon as possible. Less social media checking, less 20-minute showers, and less time trying to unlock Juri in Street Fighter: Duel.
So, this Saturday, I am NOT GOING TO STOP. I'm going to be showered, dressed, and made-up in minutes, out buying my donut, and then back home in double quick time — where I will watch movies, chat with friends, che…]]></summary>

The DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe really hits its stride with Wave 3, dropping the best courses we’d seen in the Booster Course Pass.

Depending on who you ask, Booster Course Wave 4 might actually be the best set of tracks yet.

Way back in the year 2008, my first ever front-page post for Destructoid asked if ultra-expensive, realistic-looking AAA games were where the industry was going. Flash forward nearly 16 years later, and most of the enduring, popular new intellectual properties since then haven't come AAA at all, and instead hail from what you might call "B budget" developers. Human Fall Flat, Five Nights at Freddy's, Genshin Impact, Among Us, Fall Guys, Fortnite, Vampire Survivors, and Rocket League are just a few of the non-AAA games that went on to find big, sustained audiences since then.
The list of games like this to both launch well and continue to perform well is a lot longer than the list of new, multi-million-dollar, AAA franchises that achieve the same goals in a similar timefr…]]></summary>

This week's Arcade Archives entry is another Namco oddity, as Hamster has prepped and readied little-seen sequel 3D Thunder Ceptor II, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released in 1986 as a pseudo-sequel to the original Thunder Ceptor, (which only launched earlier that same year), 3D Thunder Ceptor II ii an into-the-screen shmup/rail shooter, which sees the player pilot the titular vessel is fast-blasting sci-fi action. Devised as Namco's answer to Sega's hugely successful Space Harrier, Thunder Ceptor II features similar gameplay, (though nowhere near as fast), although it does include a rudimentary HUD, offering up information such as weapon selection and enemy position.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeTC9pVdt44&ab_channel=ReplayBurners
In the arcades, 3D Thunder Ceptor II turned heads due to its groundbreaking use of stereoscopic 3D. The cabinet itself utilized a variety of layered windows in order to create false depth, making the enemies seemingly leap off the screen and toward the player. While the game itself wasn't widespread, its utilization of 3D technology was praised, with other developers following with their own 3D titles in the following years, including Namco's own Starblade. Of course, it goes without saying that the Arcade Archives release does not include 3D support, kind of removing a key element of game's concept.
3D Thunder Ceptor II is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Last year, NIS America made a Legend of Heroes fan out of me with the release of Trails from Zero, the first part of the Crossbell Arc of the greater Trails storyline. I found it to be a fascinating RPG with an outstanding narrative and gameplay structure that positioned the title as some sort of "playable police procedural". While overly talkative (and a bit ugly on the PS4), Trails from Zero ended up as one of my favorite games from last year.
Chances are I’ll be saying the same thing about Trails to Azure when we finally get through 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knights into the Knightmare
Shovel Knight Dig is striking the earth once again. Nitrome and Yacht Club Games have announced a free DLC update for Shovel Knight Dig dubbed "Fate and Fortune," out now for PC and Apple Arcade, arriving later on console.
The Fame and Fortune DLC brings Black Knight into the fray. The shadowy dark knight teams up with Shovel Knight to help uncover the true Knightmare, unlocking Knightmare Mode once players have completed the base game.
This mode is a special challenge, where each stage will introduce new challenges. Enemies could hit harder, resources may become scarce, or the stage may even get longer. Each one stacks too, so expect some exponential escalation of difficulty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PL9-Rorp3k
It's not all doom and gloom, though. A new pal Fetcher is also here, who will be waiting at the end of each stage. For a price, he'll give you a chance to exit the well mid-run, saving your gold and returning the Knight to the Hub.
Plus, there are some Mementos awarded to players for their accomplishments, with which they can decorate the Hub. Add in a new Compendium, new music track, and some quality-of-life adjustments, and it's a pretty solid update. Additionally, the crew notes on the announcement page that more free DLC is planned for Shovel Knight Dig.
Heading down the well
Shovel Knight Dig was one of several Shovel Knight spin-offs to arrive over the last few years. And with both Dig and Pocket Dungeon, it's been interesting to see Yacht Club Games let others take a stab at the franchise and see what results come up.
While Yacht Club works away at Mina the Hollower, this new Dig update seems like a good way for eager spelunkers to dive back into the world of Dig. The update is out now on PC and mobile, and will arrive at a later date for consoles. And if you're eager to pick it up now, it's on sale on Steam right now for 40% off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a neat trick: if you want a high-end gaming laptop but don't want to pay over the odds for it, consider the Corsair Voyager A1600. If you buy it from Corsair's US web store, add a PC case like this one and then use code NEWBUILD, you can pick up the laptop and the case for significantly less than the cost of the laptop alone. 
In fact, this $1800 laptop that debuted in December last year for $2300, complete with Ryzen 9 CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 2TB of NVMe storage, a 16-in 2560x1600 (16:10) 240Hz display and Radeon RX 6800M graphics card, goes down to just $1536. And you get a free case, essentially, which you can resell later if you don't need it. Or keep it and build a PC in it, because these Corsair cases are actually really lovely!

Playtonic Friends has announced that they’ll be publishing Canteen’s work-simulator CorpoNation: The Sorting Process. Beyond the fact that it will be coming to PC via Steam, no release window has been given.
CorpoNation: The Sorting Process casts you in the role of a new employee of Ringo CorpoNation, where you must sort their genetic samples. It’s being billed as a “linear dystopian narrative,” and features tactile desk-based gameplay. Despite being a linear narrative, you’re able to customize your room and unwind after work to make your existence feel less meaningless and empty. You can also chat with your co-workers about the latest conspiracies. Check out more in this appropriately creepy trailer.
https://youtu.be/_PLdIVrJNV4
This is probably one of my favorite genres to spring up in the last decade. Following the way-too-depressing-for-me hit, Paper’s Please, smaller developers seem to have caught on that there is a lot of satisfaction when it comes to desktop busywork. The fact that you can enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done, and be rewarded with tangible progression, and not have to spend 40 hours a week doing it is enough to strip out all the soul-sucking parts and leave pure bliss.
On the other hand, CorpoNation: The Sorting Process looks like it’s going to be a small project. Its linear narrative and overt themes leave little room to really get transcendental, but that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a fun and interesting experience. Not every game has to rewrite the playbook to be worthwhile.
CorpoNation is “coming soon” for PC.

WWE 2K23 doesn’t break the mold from last year’s big re-debut, instead offering smaller improvements and additions to the elements that worked.The action feels similar but a little more polished, the modes have more features, and is a more solid package all around. Though there are still some kinks to work out, 2K23 stands as a respectable follow-up. 
Control-wise, 2K23 is identical to the previous game’s revamped setup, but is a bit smoother. Legacy issues remain, however, such as how finicky picking up weap…]]></summary>

Lance Reddick, the actor who garnered much acclaim for his roles in The Wire and John Wick as well as his work in games, has died at age 60.
TMZ reported the news earlier today, with its sources saying it appears to be of natural causes. Reddick's representative at Portrait PR confirmed the news to Deadline, declining to offer further details.
Reddick studied music at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, and earned a Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Drama. He first started acting in 1996, taking on a number of TV roles and series appearances, as well as hitting the big screen in films like Great Expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's also on sale for the Spring Sale
Valve is celebrating one whole year since the launch of its portable gaming device, the Steam Deck. Part of that is an update that makes an already-popular modding practice official: Steam Deck startup movies.
When you boot the Steam Deck, it plays a fun little movie, as most consoles and game devices do. Deck tinkerers quickly discovered, though, that you could go into the files of the Steam Deck and alter what played for the start-up.
Originally, Valve acknowledged this with a little Beta update, expanding the possible maximum length of boot videos from 10 to 30 seconds. But in a new update, Valve is making that functionality official.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELtzcpb_j38
The Steam Deck manufacturer is also putting up some startup movie options of its own. You can find the new items in the Points Shop over here. There's everything from a Turret Factory to papercraft and a flashing, form-changing one that feels reminiscent of Everything Everywhere All At Once.
All hands on Deck
Additionally, as part of the birthday festivities, the Steam Deck is currently 10% off. This sale will last through the duration of the currently ongoing Steam Spring Sale, up until March 23 at 10 a.m. PT. And even if you have one right now, the Sale is a good chance to get a bundle of Verified games for your Deck.
It's been a heck of a launch year for the Steam Deck. Where other Valve devices like the Steam Machine struggled in the past, the Steam Deck seems to have really found its footing in the general gaming hardware space. I know I use mine pretty often, and it's been a lifesaver when travelling. Here's to another year of Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Editor's Note: This article was updated on March 20 to include statements from Bungie, Guerrilla, and Lance Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick. 
Lance Reddick, perhaps best known for his role in HBO's "The Wire" has died. He was 60 years old. 
At the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, "law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural." Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor's public relations representative, that Reddick has died.
Beyond "The Wire," Reddick also had roles in other shows like "Fringe," "Lost," "Bosch," and even last year's "Resident Evil" series on Netflix. His movie credits include the "John Wick" franchise (he was promoting the latest, "John Wick 4," which hits theaters soon, just this week), "Godzilla Vs. Kong," and more. 
On the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2's Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation's Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy's Quantum Break. 
Below are statements from Destiny 2 developer Bungie, Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla, and Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between The Last of Us, The Mandalorian, and a viral TikTok audio, Pedro Pascal has been on a roll this month. Now, he's branching out into something he's never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:


In this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.
In a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.
What exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You'll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.
Which extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strayed Lights is out next month on consoles and PC, but you can play it today via a new Steam demo. 
Developer Embers announced the news of this demo today during the Mix Direct Spring 2023 Showcase that aired today alongside a new trailer for the game. Strayed Lights continues to look great visually, and the action looks awesome. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Strayed Lights gameplay trailer below: 


"In Strayed Lights, you travel through otherworldly regions of misty woods, glowing ruins, and corrupted cities while pursued by eerie shadow creatures," a press release reads. "You also take on boss fights with colossal creatures wrought with unbridled emotion. Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. 
"Meanwhile, you'll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series." 
As for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a "limited time" experience so if you're interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there's no word on when the demo will no longer be available. 

"We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights," Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. "We've been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can't wait for players to experience it for themselves." 
Strayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a "reimagining" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. 
I recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.

Last year, the studio revealed Layers of Fears, a "psychological horror chronicle built upon the foundations of the original Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear: Inheritance, and Layers of Fear 2." This new game is essentially an Unreal Engine 5 collection of Bloober Team's Layers of Fear series, unified with new elements that tie the overall story together. 
Bloober Team revealed last month that Layers of Fears is now called Layers of Fear and will release sometime this June. Now, you can check out the game in action in the new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. 
However, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of "the coolest cards" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.
In total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Perfect World and developer Black Wings have revealed Persona 5: The Phantom X, a new mobile spin-off game for iOS and Android devices. It will be free-to-play and feature in-game purchases. 
There's no release date for the game yet, but a playtest will begin March 29 in China, as reported by IGN. The visuals and gameplay look quite similar to Persona 5, which isn't surprising considering Atlus, the original makers of Persona 5, are supervising The Phantom X's development.
You can watch the game's reveal trailer below: 


IGN reports that the game focuses on the theme of "desire," and that much like in Persona 5, Phantom X members will be able to enjoy a day at school, take part in after-school activities, and of course, infiltrate various palaces by way of the Metaverse. 
Check out the Persona 5: The Phantom X gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailers above, Persona 5: The Phantom X is shaping up to be a pretty faithful spin-off to Persona 5. Here's hoping we all get to go hands-on with it soon. 

In the meantime, read Game Informer's Persona 5 review and then check out our review of Persona 5 Royal. Read our Persona 5 Strikers review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.
For eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.

The RPG prequel to The Messenger arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 29 alongside the other versions. The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, 
“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles. With production being a world of curve balls, we had to leave the messaging at 'PC and Consoles' to avoid having to walk some things back. With the big unknowns now in the rear view, we are delighted to finally confirm the addition of Xbox to the party!”
Additionally, Sabotage revealed that Sea of Stars’ playable demo, currently available only on Switch, will make its way to other platforms later this year.
You can learn more about Sea of Stars by checking out our cover story. Sea of Stars will also be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Dying Light 2 Stay Human studio, Techland, revealed the first look at its unannounced fantasy RPG that's now in development. Now, the studio has released another conceptual look at the game. 
Back when Techland revealed it was working on this game in May of last year, it referred to the unannounced game as a "AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting." Today's new concept art features some additional details, this time with more of a focus on how the game is a narrative-driven epic. 
"We never stop improving," Techland's tweet reads. "Our newest game is set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic with an exotic open world ready to be explored. We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for."

As you can see in the concept art above, this still-untitled game continues to look intriguing. Here's hoping we learn more soon!
While waiting to learn more, read our thoughts on Techland's latest in Game Informer's Dying Light 2 Stay Human review and then check out this other piece of concept art from Techland's in-development open-world fantasy RPG.

As of today, Stranger Of Paradise therefore costs £35/$40 from the Epic Games Store, down from £50/$60. Nobody tell them that a bunch of their other games still cost $70.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fireshine Games, the publisher behind titles like Lies of P and Dredge, has revealed Toads of the Bayou, a new turn-based tactical game coming to Early Access on PC next year. 
Toads of the Bayou is the first game from La Grange, a new studio based in France, and it brings roguelike deckbuilding, settlement-building elements, and more to the strategy genre. In the game, players will control a band of toads looking for a place to call home in the swamps of the deep south. However, in order to protect your settlement, you'll need to fend off the evil Baron Samedi. Along the way, you'll grow your toad family, create more powerful decks, build a settlement, and more across each run. 
Check out the action for yourself in the Toads of the Bayou teaser trailer below: 


"Toads of the Bayou is about combining southern gothic spookiness and the sweet taste of cartoon memories into our own take on the turn-based tactical genre," La Grange game designer Alexandre Clement writes in a press release. "The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement." 
Toads of the Bayou will hit Early Access via Steam on PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.
What’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are "looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary." You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.
All three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Bethesda Softworks and developer Arkane Studios have released a new story trailer for Redfall, and it features four of the vampiric big bads we'll be battling in Massachusetts this May. 
Running nearly three and a half minutes long, this trailer shows off quite a bit of the quaint (and vampire-ridden) town of Redfall. We see our heroes in action, utilizing special abilities like invisibility, as well as a healthy dose of vampires. We also get an introduction to The Hollow Man, Bloody Tom, Miss Whisper, and the Black Sun, four vampires who appear to be at the top of the food (blood) chain in town. 
Check them out for yourself in the Redfall story trailer below: 


As you can see, this new story trailer details quite a lot about what's going on in Redfall. There are hints at the corporation behind it all, the types of vampires we'll be facing off against, many of the locales we'll be shooting our way through, and much more. 
For more about the game, check out the Redfall developer deep dive held back in January, and then watch this trailer from October that invites you to a bloody night on the town. After that, read our Redfall preview for details on how you and your friends will take back the city this summer. 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2, 2023.

Sumo Digital announced via an exclusive reveal with IGN that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 18, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a couple of juicy news bits this week about disappoint - nay, heartbreaking - launch woes, so we thought we'd engage in every dev's nightmare by talking about bad launches on The Electronic Wireless Show podcast. What are some of the bad launches we remember? What part do we play in this ecosystem? Are we just doomed to get bad PC ports for the next few years, or is this going to happen forever now.
Plus, a terrifying Tower Of Jocularity that challenges us to know when games came out (we do quite well, I think), the games we've been playing right now, and a trio of movie recommendations.

Since then, the studio have been tight-lipped about their current projects, an “online fantasy RPG” and their mysterious James Bond game - until now. Speaking with Eurogamer, IO co-owners Christian Elverdam and Hakan Abrak shed some light on the Bond project, letting us know that it’s an origin story and that it’ll follow a brand-new 007.

Cut to a couple of weeks after release and I’m having an absolute whale of a time in Endnight Games’ survival horror - and it’s all thanks to sweet, succulent blueberries.
It all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?

        <updated>2023-03-16T13:06:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed that it has acquired 12 classic arcade properties, including Berzerk and its sequel, Frenzy. 
Strangely, though, Atari did not reveal all 12 properties that it has acquired. In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a "dozen retro arcade games" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. 
"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy," the press release reads. "Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations."
Atari says Berzerk is "a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980." It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. 
"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console," Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. "Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP."
Who knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell. In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.

"Save the day on the Rainbow Islands in Kirby's Dream Land 2 and feast on arcade action in BurgerTime Deluxe, both of which are joining the Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online collection," Nintendo's description of the trailer reads. "Plus, run the table in Side Pocket on the Super NES – Nintendo Switch Online Library and scroll your roll in Xevious on the NES – Nintendo Switch Online library. All four of these titles are available for Nintendo Switch Online members to play today."

At launch, Sims would go from nascent babies to walking, talking kids, skipping the infant years that teach them, for example, how to talk in Simlish, although that does sound like baby talk too. The new expansion adds a lot to Sim’s life stages, but the real show stealer here is a pesky bug that elongates babies. Yes, you read that correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.


If you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.


You can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heed my words, dear reader: Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is best played if you go in knowing nothing about it. Zilch, zero, nada. Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. 
Here’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.
So yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Need for Speed Unbound brought high-octane races chockful of adrenaline-fueled police chases to create the best racing game of the year, according to our 2022 end-of-year awards. Today, developer Criterion Games and publisher Electronic Arts announced Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2, a title update that delivers new race types, rides, upgrades, events, challenges, cosmetics, and ways to interact with friends.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 aims to give players fresh ways to storm the streets of Lakeshore and compete. This update, which represents the first in a series of post-launch updates, introduces additional Endurance Events, new Rumble Races, and the ability to provoke cops into multiplayer chases with your friends. Volume 2 also adds 40 new challenges, including 3 new daily challenges to earn rewards like experience and money. 
New 30-second Hot Laps circuits are one way to race against the clock to earn new rewards, while Playlist Events offer more variety and major rewards like a Custom Lotus Emira Balmain Edition. Rewards in Volume 2 include new driving effects, poses, stickers, and more. You can see the trailer for the announcement below:


This update also adds the option to purchase the marked locations of all 100 Bears, 80 Street Arts, 80 Billboards, and 160 activities on your map for $5. That premium DLC unlock also includes an exclusive "Fury and Zen" clothing pack, which features a jacket, t-shirt, sweatpants, and cap.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 arrives on March 21 for all versions of the base game. For more on Need for Speed Unbound, check out our review here.]]></summary>

A mere week after being announced Before The Green Moon snuck past us and launched into full release. Just yesterday, in fact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know you all like Hardspace: Shipbreaker, and I get that on paper it is very much my type of game. It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).
The main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.

You know I have a tendency to get emotionally invested in games with photo modes (one might say too invested, in the case of my Death Stranding BB Boys road trip diary), and yep, you couldn't have predicted a more likely turn of events if you tried. Because yes, instead of bopping along to its excellent, punchy rhythm action combat and, you know, actually playing the damn thing, I've spent most of my early hours with Hi-Fi Rush fiddling about with image sliders and lining up Chai and best video game cat bot 808 into daft, stupid poses for the sake of a good screenshot. But hot damn, what a great game it is all the same.

The question comes courtesy of Fachewachewa, who asked: What's the worst thing you've done for an achievement? Or more generally, a time you were focused on a specific goal in a game, reached it (or gave up), and after, looked back and thought, "Why did I do that?" 
Why, indeed. Come and find out which achievements have spawned our biggest gaming regrets, and why not tell us about your own gaming follies in the comments? We can all wallow in our foolishness together.

Long-running living games are complicated beasts to wrangle and expand in new directions. After so many years, game modes, prior changes, and unique audience groups, a game like Destiny 2 must cater to many masters. That challenge is keenly felt with Destiny 2’s latest expansion. Lightfall is the penultimate chapter in the storytelling arc that has been underway since the original game’s launch in 2014. It misses the mark as a narrative and in a few other key ways. But as a gradual evolution of what has come …]]></summary>

PlayStation and Citizen Sleeper developer, Jump Over The Age, who is actually just solo developer Gareth Damian Martin, announced this today in a new PlayStation Blog post. The game will launch with all of its DLC on PlayStation, including Episode 1: Flux, Episode 2: Refuge, and the upcoming Episode 3: Purge. 
I reviewed Citizen Sleeper last year, giving it a 9 out of 10 and calling it a Game Informer Must Play game. You can find out why in my review here. It was also in Game Informer's top 10 games of 2022, and you can read about where we placed it here.

For those keeping score, this announcement also acts as another delay, as System Shock had been scheduled to release this month. The game will be available first on Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG for $39.99, while the PlayStation and Xbox versions will release at an unspecified later date. 
System Shock has been in the works in some form since at least 2016, beginning life as a crowd-funded passion project that aims to revitalize the 1994 classic. The remake overhauls the adventure with modernized graphics and controls, a redesigned UI, and more, but the villainous A.I. SHODAN is still voiced by her original performer.

We've seen gameplay, the reveal of Nina Williams' return, and just last week, we learned Paul Phoenix would be riding into Tekken 8 as well. 
Now, Bandai Namco has revealed that Marshall Law will be in the Tekken 8 roster in a new gameplay trailer. Marshall Law was introduced to the series in the very first Tekken game and he's been in quite a few since, including the most recent release in the franchise, Tekken 7. If you're familiar with this fighter, his heavy-hitting combos return in Tekken 8, if this new gameplay trailer is anything to go on. 
Check out the Marshall Law gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Tekken 8 does not yet have a release date but when it does launch, it will do so on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more information about the game, head to Game Informer's Tekken 8 hub.

Sure, it's not quite as bad as 'death by exploding sun' in Outer Wilds, say, but when each crash is also accompanied by heroine Junon reliving a harrowing memory from her past that she'll need to sort through and analyse before she's able to (quite literally) move on with her life, I reckon that one-two punch of sudden physical trauma and deep, emotional soul-bearing is probably just about on par with having skin and muscle seared off your own bones by a honking great supernova.

Few games in recent memory etched a permanent smile on my face the way Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon has. This prequel to the Bayonetta series rewrites its mature-rated stylish combat within the whimsical pages of a storybook, spinning an endearing yarn of a young witch fighting to prove herself while forming an unlikely friendship. The result is an eye-catching, unexpectedly dense adventure that has more charm than it knows what to do with. 
Despite arriving only a few months after Bayonetta 3, Cereza and the Lost Demon doesn’t feel like a throwaway sid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft announced last year that the hit Norse survival game, Valheim, would come to Xbox last year, but it was then delayed. Now, Valheim is finally available on Xbox, and you can download it via Xbox Game Pass starting today, too. 
That means you can play Valheim on PC via PC Game Pass, Steam, Microsoft, Humble Stores, and Xbox consoles starting today. Valheim is still coming together in early access on PC, and that remains the case on console as it's part of the equivalent Xbox Game Preview program. The game became really popular in 2021 for its unique setting within the survival genre. And simply put, the game's a great time, too.
Check it out in the Xbox release date trailer below: 


If you're hopping into Valheim today, be sure to check out our list of the best Valheim mods and then check out this impressive magic mod that brings some Skyrim flavor to the game. After that, read about the aftermath of success as it relates to Valheim in this exclusive feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo IV, the long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Diablo III, will finally release this June, but it sounds like it won't be launching on Xbox Game Pass. 
That's because Blizzard's Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, recently revealed on Twitter that there are currently "no plans" to bring the upcoming game to Game Pass, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
It's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!
March 13, 2023
As you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). 
In the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into. It runs until March 26. 
While waiting for these betas, read Game Informer's exclusive guided tour through Diablo IV's Sanctuary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.


It's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking around the deserted streets of Los Angeles - and you can take your leisure, in Dead Island 2, because most zombies are quite shambly - I encountered many a rich-person decor. Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.
There's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. "Of course, it's low hanging fruit!" he says, laughing. "And also, there's no such thing."

Dead Island 2 is set in LA, known as HellA as a little play on words, because it's full of zombies now. Your job is to smash a lot of them to pieces with a hammer, like so many sausages and balloons full of blood held together by sellotape. In the course of this, you find yourself merrily looting your way through the homes of the rich and famous, stuffing as many screws and bits of scrap metal into your pants as the elastic can handle (I assume; none of the player character options has a backpack). Notable among things I couldn't find when I went looking for them: the bastard keys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Homicidal All-Stars, the turn-based strategy game set inside a dystopian, Running Man-style TV show, has both a new name and a final release date, publishers Good Shepherd Entertainment have announced today. Releasing on May 2nd, Homicidal All-Stars will now be known as Showgunners, and... I dig it. It's much snappier than Homicidal All-Stars, and feels more in keeping with its deadly reality game show setting. And to really hammer home its reality show audience vibes, developers Artificer have released a new Steam demo today with a dedicated Twitch mode, letting streaming audiences vote and meddle with the game's action in real-time.

Blinking for the first time in Before Your Eyes is a genuinely magical moment. I don’t mean hitting a button to close your virtual eyes. Through the power of a webcam, Before Your Eyes tracks when you blink which allows you to progress through a wonderful narrative adventure title from GoodbyeWorld Games. It may seem like a novel gimmick on the surface, but the mechanic is used so inventively that it meaningfully enhances the al…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As our resident walking simulator enthusiast, I was instantly onboard when Alice Bee asked me to play a new game exploring a forest. I'm always up for a wander in the woods. I am a bit of a genre purist so with a name like Sons Of The Forest, I was concerned it might be another of those so-called walking sims that are more concerned with making you listen to a Radio 4 dramatic monologue. Thankfully, no, this is simply a pretty walking simulator exploring an island bustling with wildlife. Here, enjoy this video with some sights from my peaceful strolls.

A recent UK government survey cautiously sought opinions on whether 'grassing' on pirates may have potential as part of a public campaign. When that might happen is unknown, but not this year; people have suffered enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the best things games can do is bring you an appreciation of something you've never thought about before. You'll probably start out Zellige thinking "oh, it's making some shapes and they turn into a pattern, whatever". But within ten minutes you'll be actively saying things like "does the empty space over here feel like purity or desolation" and "what does the contrasting colour of these triangles say about their relationship with the central star?".

It's been a while since I played a game about creating art that felt effortless even as I put in a lot of effort. Zellige: The Tilemaker Of Granada is humble but delightful. It's about designing tiles. And why something that straightforward is also rich and complicated.

Luckily, puzzle is a mainstay genre in video games, from classic point 'n' click adventures to weirdo physics puzzles and aliens in space.

But at RPS we like a challenge, so we've brought you a new and improved list of the 25 best puzzle games on PC that out there today, in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fan-favorite fighter Paul Phoenix has punched his ticket (among other things) for Tekken 8, and he’s so excited that he’s let his hair down for the first time in years. 
A new trailer shows off Paul’s new look and familiar offense of dishing out powerful, flame-licked punches. At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. 


Tekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.
In 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Outlast Trials, the third entry in the popular horror franchise, will welcome players into its twisted world when it enters PC Early Access on May 18. 
A new trailer reveals the news in a rather unique fashion, showcasing voice performers recording the horrific screams, yells, and grunts that will unnerve players in the game. The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. 


The Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. 
You can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fatal Frame: Mask Of The Lunar Eclipse plunges players into the dreadful past of Rougetsu Island as three (Young women? Girls? I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. 
Overall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing.

Along the way, we get Easter eggs, including side-scrolling sequences, shortcuts in Mario Kart courses, and even nods to Bob-omb Battlefield and Tostarena. To coincide with the release of this new trailer (which you can view below), we received a new synopsis of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In each issue, Game Informer prints questions that are submitted by readers via email and standard mail. We'd like to give our website readers the chance to make the magazine as well.
You'll need to log in to your GI account and click "okay to print" for your letter or question to go through. We'd also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We'll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on April 11.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
"Which game have you replayed the most times and why?"
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

First off, our team developers have implemented a significant update to the file access system in order to use the Secure Access Framework (SAF) API for secure file access on external memory space, such as SD Cards or USB drives. This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
