        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia's entire cinema industry is on the brink of collapse. A few weeks ago, around 16 cinemas were screening pirate copies of the latest movies; last week it was 127. Not even the chairman of the Association of Cinema Owners can muster much optimism. "I can't even blame cinemas now dabbling in torrent screenings," he says. It's not a desire to make money, but a fight for survival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say, you look mighty familiar...
Nope, you're not seeing things. These familiar little characters, whom you no doubt recognize from the 1986 hit Bubble Bobble, first made their gaming debut two years earlier. They were the enemy characters in Taito's formative platformer Chack'n Pop, which is, incidentally, this week's entry to Hamster's Arcade Archives range.
Released in arcades in 1984, before finding its way to a host of preliminary console platforms, Chack'n Pop is a painfully cute cartoon adventure starring a globular character with comically extendable legs. Players are tasked with guiding Chack'n, (for that is his name), through a series of mazes, utilizing his extra-long appendages to clamber over walls, attach to ceilings, and squeeze through small gaps. Standing in Chack'n's way is a posse of "Monstas" and Mightas," who must be either avoided or subdued with a supply of bouncing explosives. Chack'n is, it appears, a real demolition blob.

Chack'n Pop would be a hit in Japanese arcades thanks to its cute 'n' colorful nature, before heading into the home via a series of ports on platforms such as the Famicom, the SG-1000, the FM-7, and MSX. The game's true legacy, however, lies in its introduction of various famous sprites, that Taito would reuse as enemy characters in Bubble Bobble, arguably the title that truly put the developer on the global gaming map. Chack'n himself is considered an important part of company history and has since made cameo appearances in later releases such as Bubble Memories, NY Captor, and Ben Bero Beh.
Chack'n Pop is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get in, play for a month, get out
While EA Play isn't something I would subscribe to year-round, it can be useful in small, strategic doses. And right now, there's a deal for new subscribers — you can get a month of EA Play for $0.99 on PC or PlayStation, which includes access to the Play List library.
It's honestly worth checking the lineup to see if anything stands out.
No shade, but it's not all sports — there's Lost in Random, It Takes Two, Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, Unravel Two, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Command & Conquer Remastered Collection, to name a few highlights. I'm sure plenty of people do subscribe just for the annual series, though. Nothing wrong with that if the timing works out. I've definitely played games with EA Play that I don't care at all about owning.
[caption id="attachment_336093" align="alignnone" width="1587"] A sample of full games in the Play List.[/caption]
It Takes Two caught on in a huge way — people like forming feel-good co-op memories with their close ones, who knew? — but don't forget about Lost in Random. It's a fairy-tale adventure game with an unforgettable Tim Burton/Henry Selick-inspired world.
Beyond full games, EA Play also has 10-hour trials for titles like F1 22 and GRID Legends.
The deal expires August 4
The $0.99 deal is in effect for EA Play on PS4, PS5, Steam, and Origin; it expires on August 4, and again, it's geared toward new subscribers. You can use this site to sign up for your preferred platform, but remember to turn off auto-renewal before your month is up.
For reference, EA Play is normally $4.99 per month or $29.99 per year.
Also worth reiterating: if you're subscribed to Xbox game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, you've already got EA Play baked into your membership. The lines are blurred these days.

Education is extremely important, but I hated school. I was never very good at it. I’m not very book smart. Then again, I’m not very street smart. What I’m getting at is: I’m not very smart in general, so school wasn’t right for me.
Self-deprecation aside, I think it’s just the academic system I don’t like. I don’t care about grades. How do you even make a child care about aptitude scores? Do you know what children do care about? Defeating Bowser. So in the early ‘90s, Nintendo loosened its grip on the Mario franchise long enough for a smattering of edutainment games to be produced. They’re not fondly remembered, which is funny because many adults still cling to the edutainment games of their youth.

This weekend, Capcom is putting in an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) 2022, showing off the recently released Capcom Fighting Collection and its upcoming sequel, Street Fighter 6.
Yesterday, the long-time developer/publisher held a special Q&A panel to discuss the two titles. Sadly, in regards to SF6, we did not receive any new footage, nor a character reveal. Capcom didn't send us away totally empty-handed, however, as it shared a selection of new screens confirming classic/nostalgia costumes for SF6's posse of World Warriors.

Among the images are old-school cool looks for The Strongest Woman in the World, Chun-Li, the endless wanderer Ryu, and everybody's favorite Family Man, Guile. In addition, we saw some new duds for newcomers Luke and Jamie.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The classic meme lives on in a Stray mod
Long after the conversations about David Cage's infamous 2010 game Heavy Rain have faded away, one meme lives on in a single word: "Jason!" For those who may be blissfully unaware, in the game, there's a moment where the player has to hit X to yell for their missing son Jason. It became a classic meme pretty much overnight, and cemented Heavy Rain's place as one of the most notorious games of all time.
Fast forward to 2022, and Stray is winning the hearts of gamers everywhere with its adorable, fuzzy protagonist. Because you're playing as a cat, there's even a whole button dedicated to meowing... oh wait, I see where they're going with this. Modder Gibrietas took one look at that button and knew what they had to do -- mod Stray so that instead of meowing, your cat yells "Jason" (originally spotted by IGN).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJIsgvTYxII
Now I guess I need to buy the PC version of this game too so I can mod it, because the idea of running around a dystopian cyberpunk city as a cat yelling "Jason" at everyone seems like a pretty awesome way to get to experience the game. Not only that, but you're also gonna be yelling "Jason" in various tones and inflections, as is true to Heavy Rain. Kudos to you, Gibrietas, for dedicating yourself to that level of detail.
While the JASON mod is easily the most ridiculous we've seen of the Stray mods, it's only one of many. I personally love that most of the mods for the game on Nexus are reskins of the protagonist so that gamers can play with a cat that looks like their own. Other highlights include one that allows your cat to wear glasses, one that turns the loading screen into Nyan Cat, and one that makes the cat slightly fatter.

If you’re coming into Time on Frog Island expecting something along the lines of A Short Hike, know that it actually shares a lot more DNA with The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening than that indie darling. Set on the titular Frog Island, you take up the role of a pipe-biting sea captain who finds himself shipwrecked after a particularly violent storm. With his vessel in shambles, the captain will have to rebuild his ship with the help of the island’s residents. But they’re not here to do anything for free. If you want their assistance, you’re going to need to give them something in return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid's back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro's long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sincerest form of flattery
Back when I covered Cybernator, someone suggested that I try 1995's Metal Warriors on Super Nintendo. It was touted as a sequel to Cybernator. It’s not, but we’ll get to that. I said I didn’t have that kind of money to drop on a single game. Well, time makes fools of us all, as now I have a copy. Don't ask.
Metal Warriors is something I only knew existed because of its value. I have a whole book on the history of Lucasarts, and I don’t remember it even mentioning it (though it has been a while since I last cracked its spine). It was designed by the creators of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, a game that I am very familiar with. However, Metal Warriors’ pricetag kept me away. Which is one of the biggest problems with the collector’s market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NBA star can soon dunk on Bugs Bunny
Warner Bros. platform fighter MultiVersus is adding some more combatants to its roster. LeBron is set to join the MultiVersus lineup on July 26, while animated duo Rick and Morty arrive as part of Season One.
MultiVersus is currently in a closed alpha, but the game goes into open beta next week on July 26. LeBron's debut will coincide with the open beta, bringing passes, dunks, and three-pointers to the melee.
It's worth noting that this is LeBron as he appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. Which, granted, he appeared as himself in that movie. But that means he'll be donning the Toon Squad jersey and doing some basketball moves beyond conventional, human bounds. It seems like the main mechanic involves passing the ball around and going for big dunks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMnx77Djnu4
Voicing LeBron is John Bentley, who also lent his vocal talents to Barrett Wallace in 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake.
Rick and Morty, meanwhile, will be waiting a little longer for their debut. The pair will be arriving in MultiVersus sometime in its first season.
https://twitter.com/multiversus/status/1550539268098953216/
A massive crossover
MultiVersus is Warner Bros. and Player First Games' take on the Smash Bros. concept. It boasts crossovers from across a bunch of Warner Bros. properties, ranging from Shaggy and Velma to Harley Quinn, Bugs Bunny, the Iron Giant, and soon, LeBron James.
Is this an absolutely bonkers character idea? Of course. But I really dig it. Part of the appeal in these crossover platform fighters is seeing a bunch of recognizable faces duke it out, and while LeBron's made game cameo appearances before, just the possibility of dunking on Batman as LeBron seems reason enough to try Multiversus out.
MultiVersus goes into open beta on July 26, though you can also get in now with early access via Twitch drops or purchasing a Founder's Pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jackbox is back again
It seems like yesterday that Jackbox games came out for the first time and revolutionized the party game scene, but they just announced their newest release: Jackbox Party Pack 9. How we went through so many Party Packs this quickly is beyond me, but given how much I play these games at my own events, I'm excited to have another set of games to try out.
I have to admit I always look forward to seeing the theming of each Party Pack, and this time each of the games are made to look like a billboard, with the number 9 floating in the sky like a cloud — cute.
The games in Jackbox Party Pack 9 include:
Quixort, a co-op trivia sorting game where players will have to sort a series of blocks in order thanks to the help of some little robots.
Junktopia, a storytelling game where players are turned into frogs by an evil wizard, and must earn their way back into the wizard's good graces by giving random objects amusing backstories to increase their values.
Roomerang, a role-playing game where players take on the role of gameshow contestants and must answer prompts and avoid elimination.
Fibbage 4, the return of a classic where players must bluff and get other players to believe their false answers.
And finally Nonsensory, a laid-back game where players write, draw, and try to guess the silly things that their friends wrote and drew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HaToA3lew8
The return of Fibbage also brings some new features along as well, like Fibbage Enough About You mode, Cookie's VHS Vault, Fibbage Fan Questions, and more. If you want to see the new games in action, you can also check out the livestream event that Jackbox put on in conjunction with Gish.
The Jackbox Party Pack 9 is set to release this fall, so we'll have plenty of fun new games to try out at our parties in the coming months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also, Batman is "really dead"
Gotham Knights is set to pit the rag-tag Bat-family against the enigmatic Court of Owls. There's a good chance we'll see some other classic Batman villains as well. But it sounds like the Joker won't be among the rogue's gallery of Gotham Knights.
Speaking at San Diego Comic Con 2022 yesterday (via IGN), Gotham Knights creative director Patrick Redding says the Joker won't be in Gotham Knights. The door's still open for another clown-crime doer though; Redding would not confirm or deny whether Harley Quinn is in the game.
Redding also notes that Batman is "really dead" in Gotham Knights. There's been some speculation that may not be the real case, and who knows? Bat-stories have pulled off stranger twists. But for now, the focus is on the extended Bat-family.
To wit, there was also a new trailer shown, spotlighting Batgirl's crimefighting capabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxJcx86-vJU
A bad night in Gotham
It seems like Batgirl's got the usual lineup of Bat-gadgets and gizmos in Gotham Knight. She also has her own Bat-bike, which looks like it could make a big entrance.
I'm really a fan of the baton she has though. At multiple points it acts a regular blunt object or like a tonfa, but we also see it extend out into a longer reach weapon and cause shockwaves. Seems like she's set on making sure Gotham's evildoers don't stop fearing the bat symbol, even in Bruce's absence.
Batgirl is one of the four playable characters in Gotham Knights, alongside Robin, Nightwing, and Red Hood. And while she won't get to take down the Joker, she and the other crimefighters will still have plenty to deal with in the Court of Owls, it seems.
Gotham Knights will take a bit out of crime on October 25, 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Is your Nintendo Switch Pro Controller dead? Well, thanks to this post on reddit by imnotgoats that's been gaining traction this week, you might have an option before sending it off to Nintendo for repair.
If your Switch Pro Controller is dead, try the sync button
Although Switch Pro Controllers have a fairly good reputation, it isn't foolproof. Some folks, even after years of use, have reported that their controllers have entered a weird state where they seem completely dead. As in, the battery seems to be out of operation, and no amount of charging will work (the charging light won't even come on).
As the reddit thread points out, even swapping docks/cables might not solve the issue. However, upon pressing the sync button, the controller "sprang to life," and hasn't had the same issue. It's such a simple little fix but it's not something a lot of folks wouldn't think of in the moment. I mean logic would dictate that plugging it into a perfectly working cable and dock and not having the charging light come on indicates a critical battery issue, but there is one last ray of hope with the sync button.
Someone in the post even mentions they've had one that's been sitting on a shelf for at least a year with this problem! Another good point is that a lot of folks play with it permanently plugged into a PC, and wouldn't even think to ever press the sync button for any reason.
The Switch Pro Controller is still incredible
The Switch Pro Controller might be my single favorite device of this generation, just because of how stable it is. It holds a charge for...forever, to the point where I just don't even need to think about it. Plus, the Monster Hunter Rise special edition Pro looks gorgeous, so I get to look down every once in a while and enjoy the design. Functionality and flair: win-win!

King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A novel concept for a horror escape game
Plenty of games have gimmicks. But I think Refund Me If You Can might be the first time I've seen a game use a storefront's refund policy as a gameplay mechanic.
Freshly arrived on Steam today, I noticed Refund Me If You Can pop up on the TodayOnSteam automated bot account. It's a handy account for noticing strange and eccentric new releases, and this horror game in particular started to catch folks' eyes as it spread around.
The premise of Sungame Studio's experience is that you are locked in a maze, with a monster tracking you down. Your equipment is sparse: just a flashlight and a couple of neon flares, to leave as markers for your future self. You need to find an exit, and find one fast. Not just because of the monster, mind you, but also because you've got a time limit.

According to its Steam page, Refund Me If You Can has "more than 100" paths, but only one leads out. And the entire time, in the upper-left corner, the clock is ticking down.
"After two hours the sucess [sic] will be locked forever." Essentially, it seems like victory is sealed off alongside the refund window.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSmnJqwL6tM
Little storefront of horrors
Valve's Steam storefront started offering refunds quite a while ago. They were pretty lenient, with only two qualifiers: you must have bought something in the last two weeks, and played less than two hours of it.
And while independent developers and makers of short games have reported issues with the system, Refund Me If You Can turns it on its head. Can you beat it in two hours? Can you essentially play a game for free, just by beating it?
It's a pretty novel way of sticking out, especially in the flooded market of scary horror games. Refund Me If You Can is available for $3.99 on Steam.

The attractive Capcom booth has demo booths in which it is showing off a build of the recently revealed fighter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Be sure to lock that leg strap on tight
The summer is here, with plenty of sun to go around. But if you'd rather play some indoor sports, Nintendo Switch Sports is getting a free update next week that adds some new moves to its various games. Keep cool and annihilate the competition.
A new update arriving July 26 at 6 p.m. PT will add some new features to Nintendo Switch Sports. The big one is more leg strap integration with Soccer, allowing you to use real-life kicks full Soccer matches.
This should add a little more activity to Soccer, which previously used a mixture of Joy-Con presses and other motions. This option will let you really juice up your kicks with real-life motion. Just make sure your strap is on tight, as you don't want to kick-fling a Joy-Con across the room.

But if Soccer isn't your jam, there are some other updates coming to other modes. Volleyball gets a few new moves for players to execute, like the Slide Attack and Rocket Serve.

Join the league
The Nintendo Switch Sports update will also add new ranks to the Pro League modes. Joining Friend Matches using Room IDs will also make it easy to connect with others looking to launch soccer balls across the pitch with massive leg swings.
Nintendo Switch Sports is the Switch's take on the classic Wii Sports set-up, mixing motion controls and sporting activities for a family party game experience. It had its ups and downs, as you can read in our review; while mainstays like Bowling and Tennis stay mostly strong, other modes had some struggles.
Hopefully the new moves add a little extra oomph to everyone's virtual Soccer and Volleyball matches. The Nintendo Switch Sports free update goes live with these new changes on July 26, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors. See you in chat!]]></summary>

The characters arrive as part of October's big Winters' Expansion release for Resident Evil Village. The new expansion is bringing a ton of content to Resident Evil Village, including a new story segment starring Rose and third-person mode. But today, we're here to talk about playable Lady Dimitrescu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shrine like a Star
Natsume Inc's long-awaited sequel Pocky & Rocky Reshrined finally hit PS4 and Nintendo Switch platforms last month, bringing with it nostalgic visuals, great gameplay, and some classic, old-school adventure. It was well received by both critics and fans, for the most part.
While players heaped praise on the franchise's authentic return, many were left understandably frustrated by Natsume's baffling decision to lock the game's multiplayer modes, only accessible once the player has completed Story Mode and bagged themselves 10,000 in-game coins. A bizarre choice, frankly, given Pocky & Rocky's natural propensity for co-op action and its fun cast of new characters. To this day, critics and players have been rendered utterly confuddled by the user-unfriendly decision.
Perhaps realizing the error of its ways, Natsume has released a new cheat code that will allow you to jump into the co-op action with your buddies immediately, (spotted by Japanese video game fan Gosokkyu/GSK).
All you need do is arrive at the Pocky & Rocky Reshrined main menu and enter the following inputs:
Left, Left, Left, Left
Right, Right, Right, Right
Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right
Once you complete this sequence, the auto-save symbol should appear. Now you can access the Free Mode, giving you access to the full roster of characters, and two-player co-op. While I understand that purists might suggest that the multiplayer mode is a "reward" for finishing the game, it was simply a foolish move to lock such an intrinsic part of the Pocky AND Rocky experience away from the player base from day one. Still, it's a very cute, very fun, and very challenging sequel. Well worth a look.
Pocky & Rocky Reshrined is available now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some stories will have gameplay mechanics that inform other eras
Want a Live A Live tip? While the game is fairly straightforward (you do a series of individual stories that connect) there's one big thing you can do to make everything easier: take some breaks, and don't be afraid to drop in and out of stories.
As we talked about in the review, Live A Live is actually comprised of several eras with unique protagonists (with their own sets of skills and equipment):
Prehistory
Imperial China
Edo Japan
Wild West
Present Day
Near Future
Distant Future
Starting with Imperial China is a good way to get acclimated with Live A Live
Another Live A Live tip: you can pick any of them to start with, and really, there's no wrong choice. However! Imperial China is one of the most "ramp"-prone stories: meaning, it eases you in more than say, Edo Japan or Present Day, which kick off with higher-stakes combat.
Speaking of: combat! If you dive into a story (like the aforementioned two) and are immediately pressed with figuring out Live A Live's combat system, it's totally okay to head to the main menu, then quit to the "character/story select" screen. From there you can head into an era that might have a better "intro" so to speak, with more time to breathe and learn how to approach the combat grid and the movement mechanic.

        <updated>2022-07-22T15:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.]]></summary>

Nexon's rad new fighting title DNF Duel has received its first post-release update, bringing a small fistful of important changes to the rule-breakin' brawler. Now available on both PlayStation and PC, Update 103 brings a couple of much-needed character tweaks as well as adjustments to various modes on PC.
First and foremost, Crusader's reign of holy error is over, (for the most part), as developer Arc System Works has removed the truthsayer's devastating "Sacred Upper" infinite combo loop. That's not to say that Crusader is no longer a threat — dude is a monster — but at least that's one particularly silly weapon removed from his arsenal.
In addition to this major fix, several other characters have received bug stomps that couldn't wait for a larger balance check down the line. Grappler's "Break Down" will now connect on a crouching Enchantress, so no more hiding for the sneaky magical maiden. Striker's Airwalk has had an adjustment made to its gravity mechanics, while Lost Warrior's Mysterious Pierce will now interact more consistently when it collides with opposing projectiles. As if that mf'er needed any more help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf0ZlqM1yfQ
On PC, several changes have been made to optimize player interaction with offline modes. Training Mode will no longer be confused when dealing with recorded actions made via custom button layouts, while keyboard players will no longer find themselves randomly isolated from their controls during online matches. In regards to full balance changes and mechanic tweaks, a further major update is expected at some point in the near future.
Don't buy into the naysaying. DNF Duel is an accessible, silly, and fun fantasy fighter — boasting a fun cast, cool visuals, and tight online play. It is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.
Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.
The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.
Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.]]></summary>

While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.
Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.
If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.
Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.
Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?]]></summary>

Released in 1995 at the height of the block-dropping renaissance, Kirby's Avalanche, (also known as Kirby's Ghost Trap), is a reskinned edition of the Japanese classic Super Puyo Puyo, offered a fresh coat of Kirby-based repaint in order to make it a little more endearing for the western market. In typical Puyo Puyo fashion, players must connect together descending drops of colored blobs, matching up palettes in order to create bonus-scoring combos. For many westerners, …]]></summary>

Growing up in the ‘90s in rural Canada meant that I saw the decline of the arcade early. However, I’ve always had an overwhelming fondness for them. My mind is so focused on video games, that I can still point out the bowling alleys that had a Metal Slug cabinet. I recall the time that one place had Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter. What a win! When I went to Japan, I stopped in every tobacco-scented game center I crossed paths with.
I recently changed my life by getting a decent arcade stick. It’s very difficult to find any cabinets these days (I wonder if the Galaxy Theatre still has Virtual On), but the feeling of slamming my fingers across a cluster of big ol’ buttons eases my longing.
But a good arcade stick is nothing without games to play using it.…]]></summary>

Few horror series in games are as talked about or discussed as Silent Hill. And while there's plenty of fascinating material in them, Masahiro Ito would like to clarify one point in particular: that's snow, not ash, in Silent Hill.
Ito worked as a monster and background designer on the first Silent Hill, before going on to be art director for Silent Hill 2 and 3. You might wonder why, of all things, this clarification is important. Or maybe why it has to be clarified at all. For that, we'll need to take a trip through Silent Hill history.
In the original 1999 game, white dots pepper the sky outside. There is a clear moment in game where, in dialogue, the characters address that it's snowing outside. Ito posted the exact screenshot, saying …]]></summary>

Now, for this year's San Diego Comic-Con, Squishmallows has announced their newest collab with Pokémon, and fans couldn't be more thrilled.
Squishmallows and The Pokémon Company made the announcement official yesterday, and Jazwares (aka the company that owns Squishmallows) global brand manager Aaron Margolin tweeted out a picture revealing that it wasn't just Pikachu who was getting the Squishmallows treatment, but Gengar too.

Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. 


Splinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. 
Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities."

With patches rolling out all the time, staying caught up with Vampire Survivors hasn't been easy, but it's been fun pretty much every step of the way. The new content in patch 0.9 feels a bit on the light side from the outside looking in, yet when you actually try it out, it's memorable. The biggest addition is Boss Rash, an arena-based survival mode. If you can survive 15 minutes, you'll be able to unlock a wonderfully strange new character.
Before you can enter Boss Rash, you'll first need to unlock Hyper Mode on the five regular stages — Mad Forest, Inlaid Library, Dairy Plant, Gallo Tower, and Cappella Magna. Hyper Mode will open up once you slay the boss that appears at the 25-minute mark on these stages; …]]></summary>

Bandai Namco has locked in a launch date for multiplayer survival game Dragon Ball: The Breakers. The asymmetrical horror begins on October 14, 2022.
Dragon Ball: The Breakers is a game set in the popular anime series, but in multiplayer survival horror form. Players take on the role of either seven average citizens, caught in a temporal seam; or the immensely powerful Dragon Ball villains hunting them down, a.ka. the Raider.
These villains include Buu, Cell, and Frieza, who got a new trailer today. The idea is to make it out alive through teamwork and clever use of distractions and tactics. Otherwise, the ordinary players will all perish at the hands of Dragon Ball's meanest and most vile. In Frieza's case, this means a lot of explosions, l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft’s open-world title set in James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy universe, will now launch sometime in either 2023 or 2024. The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. 
Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

It's a light year for Ubisoft, and the publisher's future lineup just got lighter. As disclosed during the company's Q1 fiscal 2022-23 earnings report, Ubisoft has decided to cancel four upcoming games, including Splinter Cell VR and Ghost Recon Frontline. This year's Avatar game, meanwhile, was delayed — it's now aiming for fiscal year 2023.
As reported by Axios' Stephen Totilo, Ubisoft told investors that it canceled the development of Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two unannounced games.
Splinter Cell VR might seem like a hazy memory at this point. It was announced for Oculus headsets alongside an Assassin's Creed VR game back in 2020, and we never had much to go on other than the lead developer: Ubisoft's Red Storm Entertainm…]]></summary>

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.
In creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn.

Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. 
For those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. 
The new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. 


Dragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After four hours with Saints Row, it's funny being back in the present. I have a gaming PC! Bills to pay! A smartphone that recognises my face! Grey hairs! I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped.

Boisterous business discussions and the clanking of silverware ring out from the crowded patio of a corner restaurant in the heart of Champaign, Illinois, a small college town two hours south of Chicago. Lording over these hungry patrons is the stoic face of Deep Silver Volition. The studio’s logo hangs a few stories above the lunch spot on the side of a brownstone building. Many eating here today are likely Volition employees, and they have reason to celebrate with a feast, as their studio’s next game, Saints Row, is nearing completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in June, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered swings to PC this August. If you've been wondering how the game will take advantage of your gaming rig, a new trailer runs down the list of features that will make Peter Parker’s adventure even more spectacular. 


Spider-Man will be treated to a host of graphical and performance upgrades, such as: 
Unlocked framerates
Nvidia DLSS AI performance boost
Nvidia DLAA AI enhanced image quality
Ultra-wide monitor support
Ray-traced reflections (for compatible PCs)
Improved shadows
DualSense controller support
As a reminder, this Remastered version of the 2018 title launched on PlayStation 5 as a pack-in with Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. As such, the PC version is the first time it's been available as a standalone product. In addition to introducing Peter Parker's redesigned face, the remaster also includes the Black Cat-focused story expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, and exclusive suits such as Spidey's outfits from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launches on Steam and The Epic Games Store on August 12. You can read our review of the original PS4 version here. Miles Morales is also slated to come to PC later this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.
However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.
Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.

I've enjoyed revisiting this meta first-person puzzler, but sometimes I can only manage small chunks before its endlessly repeating corridors start to feel like they're bearing down on me a bit. Thankfully, its latest quality of life update might just be the thing I need. As well as introducing a swathe of new accessibility features, its auto-walk function now has a toggle option - and as developers Crows Crows Crows have noted on Twitter, this means that "so long as you're in a straight corridor it allows the game to play itself!" Magic.

This crew will even share their thoughts as they’re wandering about. See for yourself in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky’s 20th free update, Endurance, soars into the game today. Hello Games describes Endurance as an “overhaul” to the freighter captain experience, giving players new tools and functionality that make commanding a fleet of ships more entertaining and manageable. 
Players can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. 


Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.]]></summary>

This here is Clanfolk, a settlement sim about a family of Scottish tamagotchis. The first thing you'll be screaming at me, as if I have not noticed, is how recognisably Rimworldy it looks. You're right. Considering RimWorld cribbed plenty of its own notes from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, it might feel incongruous to criticise Clanfolk for clinging too tightly to the hem of its inspiration. Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game.

In this I may have something in common with the Steam Deck. Valve tweeted earlier today to let users "in the midst of a heatwave" know that at temperatures over 35 degrees centigrade, the Steam Deck may not run at its best.

The game’s reveal caught my eye thanks to its striking art direction and unique gameplay. I’ve spent the last couple of days battling the darkness as the titular Victoria Bloom, a precocious young girl searching her ancestral home for her missing uncle after it’s been overtaken by shadow monsters. Armed with a powerful flashlight, you’ll battle a living darkness in an ever-changing mansion steeped in mystery and secrets. 
I’m enjoying the game, but it took longer than I would’ve liked to get used to its strange control scheme. Eyes in the Dark plays like a twin-stick shooter, with players using the left stick for movement and the right stick to aim their auto-damagi…]]></summary>

In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Studios’ back catalogue shows a team that's constantly growing, changing and learning from their past – something that has never been clearer than in their most recent game, Deathloop. The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.
While Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in April that the Switch-exclusive No More Heroes 3 was expanding its horizons to other platforms, but now we know Travis Touchdown’s latest adventure makes the move in October.
A flashy new trailer reveals that on October 11, No More Heroes 3 migrates to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. 


No More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: 
“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”]]></summary>

Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will "carry forward our vision for the game."
The blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: 
Last December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a hot minute since a cute animal adventure scarred me for life. Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.
Endling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.

Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. 

The Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”
The Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99. Will you be securing a set for yourself?

        <updated>2022-07-19T13:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura enjoyed his tour of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, capturing footage of the various workspaces, Sega president Haruki Satomi (he conducted the tour), and even some new Yakuza screenshots. Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. 


Like a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  
The off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)
July 19, 2022
In any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:
"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series."

I'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not.

I’ll let Forza Horizon 5’s Hot Wheels expansion off though. Launching today, it looks like bloomin’ good open-world racing fun, even if there’s too much liquid hot magma on display.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. 
The Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.
We were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.
You can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's Honey, I Shrunk The Kids-inspired survival game Grounded has been tapped for a new animated series, Deadline reports.
Grounded, currently playable in Xbox Game Preview/Steam Early Access and slated to launch in full this September, will be adapted by writer Brent Friedman whose credits include Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Wars: Rebels/The Clone Wars. Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.
Deadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.
"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community," says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. "We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series."
The Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform. Meanwhile, the video game is only a couple of months from its full launch after spending two years in early access. It will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

Decisions have unforeseen consequences. If one were to look for the thematic idea that links the story of As Dusk Falls with its gameplay structure, it’s hard to avoid that statement as a driving message. Life is filled with decisions big and small that shape the future, and we don’t always know how an errant word or turn down a different road might eventually conclude. Interior/Night’s emotionally rich and risky debut game isn’t interested in giving you the choice of how the character’s lives turn out; like in real life, that’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cats are masters of their domain. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.
Stray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.

Stray is a game about being a cat. You see, explore, and mess with the world in the ways only they can. Because you're doing so in one of the more densely-packed video game worlds in recent memory, there's plenty of room for kitty antics. Luckily, Stray wastes no moment letting you fulfill any feline aspirations you may have. 
After being separated from their furry friends, the unnamed cat (we'll call "Stray") finds itself deep in an underground city walled off from the outside by a giant dome. Befriending a small drone named B12, Stray sets out to open the city, t…]]></summary>

Far from being just another PC hardware thing to check off, they look like they might be alright?


Both hit the 2560x1440 resolution with a 165Hz refresh rate, with the Canvas 27QHD being a flat 27in screen and the Canvas 32QHD Curved being 32in and… well, curved. They support AMD FreeSync Premium, meaning they should work with Nvidia G-Sync as well, and come with anti-glare coatings to see off reflections.

When I first sampled the tower defence deckbuilding delights of ORX a couple of months ago, I'd assumed that we'd be playing as the demo's medieval castle builders throughout. Today, however, devs Johnbell have announced a brand-new faction for the game, the sand-loving Dune Reavers. Even more intriguing, though, is that the Dune Reavers aren't actually big fans of building, you know, towers, favouring instead the brute force approach of their large armies. Can you still call it tower defence if there aren't any towers involved? Decide for yourself by watching the new gameplay trailer below.

Split perfectly into two chunks that cover three chapters each, it's a thrilling adventure that deserves a prime time slot in your evenings over the weekend.

Well, Elden Ring streamer Ainrun managed to do that, and didn’t skip the Grafted Scion boss like other streamers. Nice.

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said that games companies and platforms needed to ensure parental purchase controls and age restrictions were in place to let kids play without the risk of harm, and to put parents’ minds at ease. Xbox’s parental restrictions on loot box purchases for under-18s were singled out for praise, and the government now say they will legislate if the rest of the industry doesn’t follow suit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. 
Full Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile.

Grime must be eliminated and I am there to facilitate that request with water and power. But occasionally I succumb to frustration as something I consider pristine isn't determined clean by the little progress bar that usually pats me on the back for jobs well done.
Then I learned that although grime can’t move, it makes up for it with cunning. It cements itself on surfaces in ways you wouldn't expect, as if to belittle my cleaning standards. After many encounters, I've identified this menace as The Underside: a secret boss you'll need to beat to become the ultimate power washer.

Publisher Annapurna Interactive has partnered with cat Travel Cat, a brand of cat travel accessories, to unveil an official line of Stray-branded cat harnesses and backpacks for your real-life kitty.
First up is the harness, a replica of the one worn by Stray’s furry protagonist. It features adjustable chest and neck straps secured by buckles and velcro. The six-foot reflective nylon leash helps owners keep track of their cats in dark alleys while allowing room to explore. You can pre-order it today for $39.99. 

If you’d rather give your cat the royal transportation treatment, the Stray version of Travel Cat’s popular “The Fat Cat” backpack is up your alley. This colorful pack can support up to 25 lbs of feline and is made of breathable, well-ventilated material and a little bubble for the cat to curiously peer at the world. Pre-orders are open now and will set you back $139.99.

You can purchase both items, which are expected to ship later this year, at Travel Cat’s website here.
Stray launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC and stars an orange cat searching for its family in a futuristic neon city inhabited by robots. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here.]]></summary>

The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.]]></summary>

What do a murderous witch, a grandmother’s mysterious death, and demonic possession have in common? An old Polaroid-style camera. Discovering how means braving Madison, an indie horror title that fits within the post-P.T. first-person haunted house mold. Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that’s more than meets the eye. Despite having a strong premise, presentation, and core mechanic, the experience gets bogged down by flawed puzzle de…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.
Survios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens "where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs."
There’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.
This project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.]]></summary>

That's because we're talking about our favourite towers in games. This means we need to draw a distinction between towers (the gamified concept as most popularly complained about in Ubisoft games) and towers (the architectural thing). Luckily, games have a lot of both.
Meanwhile, Nate's fish issue (fisssue?) is growing worse, I am enjoying the local acts performing on the summer bandstand, and we talk about Lord Of The Rings and Lord Of The Rings related things. What fantasy creature would you like to conjure into real-life existence? We both said orc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. 
According to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. 
You can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.
Loyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles." Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. 
These collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  
“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.
PlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels more overdue than surprising, Nintendo acquired animation studio Dynamo Pictures and renamed it Nintendo Pictures. The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. 
According to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: 
"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year."
