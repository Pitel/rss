It must have been tough for chocolate lovers to get any chocolate when Willy Wonka was hiding golden tickets inside the wrappers.
Joking aside, that's more or less been the vibe from Prismatic Evolutions, the just-released, mega-hyped Pokémon card set that’s memorable for its heavy representation of the fan-favourite Pokémon Eevee, and all its evolutionary forms. The 180+ card set was smoke-signaled by The Pokémon Company a little under four months out from its January 2025 release, and fans have anticipated it as the de facto set to look out for, largely due to its similarity to the most popular TCG expansion from the company’s previous card generation, Evolving Skies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t know how to tell you this, but PureArts and Capcom have announced a three-foot tall bust of Nemesis from the Resident Evil 3 remake. You can pre-order it today. It’s only being produced in limited quantities, but, uh, I’m not sure what the market is like on this sort of thing.


Maybe you don’t have my problem. I have too much video game paraphernalia. When I was younger, video game-related merch wasn’t nearly as common, but now it’s everywhere for everything. So, I don’t really know where I’d put something like this. Even if I did, it’s a very unique statement piece. Nemesis is grotesque. Just this big melty-dude staring at me from the corner while I’m drinking tea or something.


He’d maybe be good in the entryway. I could put my hats and scarves on him. Maybe him a little hug when I come home. Scare the couriers who make deliveries at my apartment. However, I wouldn’t spend $1899 for something like that. I’m not saying it’s not worth it. That’s an awful lot of resin. I just don’t think that much resin fits in with my budget.

It says how much it costs and that it’s 1/1 scale, but not how much it weighs. Is it hollow. The press release does note that it would pair well with the Lady Dimitrescu 1/4 Scale Statue. I don’t agree with that. Maybe if it was a 1/1 bust of Lady Dimitrescu, but I feel like a full statue would make poor Nemesis feel a bit jealous. When decorating, I feel a room must be dedicated to full figures or busts, but never mix both.


Anyway, if you’re interested in this massive chunk-a-hunk, pre-orders are open today. It’s available worldwide, but I can’t imagine the shipping costs for something like that. The final product ships Q1 2026.

I remember an early discussion by developer and publisher Ubisoft almost two decades ago talking about future entries into the franchise exploring unique periods including Egypt—which ended up being a big change for the series with Assassin's Creed Origins—and Japan.


I recently got some hands-on time with the early parts of Assassin's Creed Shadows, including the prologue that introduces both playable characters Naoe and Yasuke, and one of the early sequences of missions in the open world.


My biggest takeaway from the preview was just how immersive Shadows felt in its setting, from the world in which it takes place to the story it's telling. After roughly three and a half hou…]]></summary>

Given that Microsoft owns some of the biggest franchises in gaming, there's usually a little bit of hype around it. This year is unlikely to be an exception, with the 2025 showcase kicking off in just a few hours (at the time of writing). It's scheduled to go ahead at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK.




If you want to check out Xbox Developer Direct, there are plenty of ways you can do this. For example, if you're on YouTube, you can go to either the official Xbox or Bethesda channels.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.
Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG" from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for here, should you wish. Here's the sell:

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

        <updated>2025-01-23T16:55:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The iconic PPSh-41 has been a powerhouse in multiple Call of Duty entries, all spanning from the game's WWII era. Now, it'll make a new name for itself in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2, expanding the ever-so-mobile SMG class. Here's how to unlock it. 


How do you unlock the PPSh-41 in BO6 and Warzone Season 2?


You can unlock the PPSh-41 in the Season 2 Battle Pass on Page 6 as an HVT Tier Reward or from a Blueprint on Page 14. The new season arrives on Jan. 28, 2025, so you must wait until then. Once it drops, you'll likely have the choice of getting it for free with enough XP or through a premium purchase for those who want to get it instantly.


To get the PPSh-41 for free, you can start farming for XP by simply playing the game. Using tokens is always a good way to go, and there may be another Double XP Weekend event that could help you out even more. Plus, you can rely on Daily Challenges to get around 2,500 to 5,000 XP.

Like many SMGs, PPSh-41 thrives in close-range combat, excelling in rapid-fire and damage rates. However, you may want to tweak its build to improve recoil control and handling. SMGs are known to have issues with these two stats, but thankfully, a quick change to attachments can be highly beneficial.


Equip any muzzle to the PPSh-41 to help with recoil control, and attach a stock to get a better grip on handling. You can also equip an extended magazine to compensate for this SMG's relatively low 32-mag size. The rest of the build depends on your preference, whether with optics or barrels to increase damage.


The more you play around with the PPSh-41, the more likely you'll earn unique camos for this build. Use the new Challenge Tracking system to keep track of your progress, earning you designs for BO6 Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. The PPSh-41 is excellent for BO6 Zombies, in particular, as it's been widely used in several undead iterations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even when it is out of season, the Gingerbread House in Disney Dreamlight Valle has a lot of value to the wonderful Disney friends around you, like Mickey and Goofy. Here's how you can make it.


All Gingerbread House Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To make a Gingerbread House, you'll need the following ingredients:



Wheat


Egg


Vanilla


Sugarcane


Ginger

Wheat can be bought from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow. It's super cheap as the ingredient itself is 2 Star Coins, while the seeds are 1 Star Coin. Both may be available at the stall. The seeds grow within a minute after getting planted and watered.


Eggs can be purchased at Chez Remy for 220 Star Coins after finishing the Ratatouille realm quests in the castle.


Vanilla is found within the Sunlit Plateau. Look at the ground, and you'll find a green plant with small yellow/white petals growing from within the grass. Pick it up, and you'll gain Vanilla for the recipe. 


Sugarcane is found at Goofy's Stall in Dazzle Beach. You can buy its seeds for 5 Star Coins each. You can also make Cheesecake with this ingredient.


Lastly, Ginger can be found growing in the Forgotten Lands. This ingredient can be picked up like Vanilla. The green plant with regular, slightly lengthier leaves on it gives you Ginger. 


Now it's time to make the 5-star dish


Once you have all of the ingredients, go to any cooking station at your house or in Chez Remy. Throw in all five ingredients together, and then you'll have a Gingerbread House in your inventory. You can sell it to Goofy's Stall for 545 Star Coins or eat it for 1,460 Energy points.

We've got an updated look at the Japanese software charts courtesy of Famitsu and, given the arrival of a new Nintendo joint, there was never any doubt about who was going to be in first place.
Yes, much like in the UK, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD has swung its way to gold in its debut week after shifting an impressive 107,093 copies. But just look at all the other newbies that DK had to beat to nab the gold! Dynasty Warriors: Origins on PS5 posted a less impressive debut but still managed 63,805 copies to land in second, and Switch took the lion's share of Tales of Graces f Remastered's sales, which arrived in third.

There are plenty of choices to pick from, but some are far more effective than others. When you combine a great Artifact with a meta unit, clearing any in-game content will become easier.


All Artifacts in Verse Piece


Every Artifact offers some boost, which varies between offensive and defensive styles. Additionally, some of them might also offer unique abilities, which raises their potential inside the game.



Explosive Artifact: Causes an explosion upon resetting, which deals AoE damage.


Ice Artifact: Puts a freezing effect on enemies, and works well in both PvP and PvE scenarios. Frozen enemies will have hindered movement, which is amazing for crowd control.

As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

The game represents perhaps the most cavernous, yawping blind spot in my entire pile of shame. I do own it, but I'm yet to play. I've already read a great deal of extended wordery on its merits - please, sell it to me in the comments in seven words or less. Here's a trailer:

Just days after Moon Studios' lead Thomas Mahler expressed his desire to see the Banjo-Kazooie franchise in the hands of a "really talented developer", original composer Grant Kirkhope has taken to social media to say that he has "zero hope" in a potential new entry (thanks, Eurogamer).
He then went on to say that a new entry probably wouldn't work anyway, as "die hard fans would instantly hate it and slag it off no matter how good it was". A few hours later, however, he backtracked on this statement and said that "the Banjo fanverse is a wonderful thing".

The winter months were pretty busy for the developers, with the release of the base game followed by the Mythical Island mini-expansion.

We have also got a first glimpse of some of the Pokemon who will be present in the expansion.


Pokemon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown release date


Before January 2025 ends, we can get our hands (digital, of course) on the new cards coming to Pokemon TCG Pocket as part of the Space-Time Smackdown expansion. The confirmation came less than 24 hours after the expansion was leaked on social media.

Trading will be the first to be added to the card-collecting app, with the feature going live on Tuesday 28th January. As specified in the info dump from TPC last week, trades can be made between friends and only with cards of the same rarity (◇1-◇4 and ☆1). As expected, consumable items will be required to make a trade, so prepare for even more currencies to keep track of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

Instead, Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios, states that the game will be "a mile marker between where we’ve come from and where we’re going".

Usually, most new characters can be obtained from the banners available inside the game. To get Okarun, you'll have to complete the portals. To be more precise, you'll have to complete the Tier 1 Ghost Portal successfully, and it can be accessed from the Ghost Tunnel story mode.

Thankfully, there are also plenty of prizes on the table for helping the two out, including the return of a coveted Shader from the original Destiny.


The Past is Prologue event is a lot like the Riven's Wishes event from last year. Guardians are given relatively basic tasks, like participating in Gambit matches or slaying Hive on the Moon, that reward Bento Tokens upon completion.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake.

Prior to the official reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, one of the late-game leaks revealed that the Joy-Con controllers would now house an optical sensor on the side, leading many to theorise that the console would support mouse functionality.
Fast forward to the debut trailer, and yes, it seems that this may well be the case. Though not officially confirmed yet, the trailer featured both Joy-Con sliding across a surface dragging wristbands (which, in true Nintendo fashion, resembled mice tails), thus heavily implying that the rumours were true.

At the time, the Chinese-made PlayStation 5 exclusive looked like another project heavily inspired by FromSoftware’s Soulsborne games.

When Astro Bot launched in September 2024 for the PS5, many lauded the game's quality and compared it favourably to some of Nintendo's very best 3D platformers.
During the recent New York Game Awards 2025 event, ex-president of Nintendo of America offered his own opinion on the game after it won the award for 'Best Kids Game', jokingly stating "I have to admit it, Astro Bot almost outdid Nintendo at its own game".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

'Retro gaming company' Sjgam has just revealed its latest handheld, the 'M20 Pro', and while it appears to be far from the best emulation device money can buy, its design looks... familiar. Let's not beat about the bush here: it's a Switch (thanks for the heads up, Notebookcheck).
According to the Sjgam website, the M20 Pro boasts a seven-inch display (1024 x 600 pixels), runs on the Linux-based EmuELEC 4.3 operating system to support over 30 emulators and comes with a dock for TV output. Notebookcheck claims that while the handheld's Rockchip RK3566 CPU and Mali-G52 GPU make for a decent budget combination, the pairing may struggle with more intense emulators like PSP and N64 — sorry, Banjo.

Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of Webfishing proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for an easygoing escape. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.

To wit: why have a lantern, asks FPS Mohrta, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Isn't Straftat a pleasing word to say? Straftat. It almost demands an angry bark, an accusatory finger. Straftat! The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of our favourite games of last year, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient Quake servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in Call of Duty: Warzone.

Lumon by Mark Gomersall is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger's Reign, discuss). It's not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it's topical. More importantly, it means I get to write "Severance is back!" a bunch. It's back! It is!

On average, games protected by anti-tamper tech Denuvo enjoy 68 days crack-free before succumbing to piracy.

Total cracking time: 628 years.

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three-person Danish team The Outer Zone and Frostpunk creators 11-bit studios have announced Death Howl, a very gloomy soulslike deck-builder set in a "stone-age Nordic-inspired" open world that consists of biomes with names like "the Forest of Howling Shadows". Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

The legal basis for these confiscations wasn't initially clear, but new information ties the action to a U.S. court order. In addition to losing their domain names, the MissAV defendants must pay $4.5 million in damages.

No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out some of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter Marvel Rivals with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play.

If I hold my thumb down on the photo in my phone's gallery, it actually springs to life for a few seconds and rewinds time in the process. It shows me wobble the phone into position and take the snap: a giant crab clings to a restaurant, a lady totters towards us with a white plastic bag looped around her arm, colourful signs stacked like Legos jut out of grey, "The Body Shop" lies in the distance because of course it does.
It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thousands of people who bought the "N95-grade" Razer Zephyr face mask during the Covid-19 pandemic are finally getting a refund for the dodgy mask, months after US agencies ordered a $1 million payout from the gaming hardware company. The Federal Trade Commission are sending out cheques as we speak. I don't know if I should be glad that a trading standards agency has done its job, or depressed that over 6,700 people thought this mask looked good enough to buy in the first place.

The game is available across various platforms, including the Google Play Store, where copyright-infringing versions are also available. Despite several complaints, Google allegedly failed to remove these unauthorized apps, which prompted the game developers to take legal action.

Animal Well, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive? Not nominated for anything. UFO 50, an impressive, important, big boy achievement snubbed by our own 2024 list? It did get a Grand Prize nomination. 

I don't disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year's Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don't mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there's no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.

On the one hand, as a fan of weird forests, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.

It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.

Team Fortune's lead developer, Dizzie, has been handed a three year sentence for a "violent crime", following around five years of legal proceedings. The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled "Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake". Don't ask me why people have started labelling fires. It's probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda's somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great," Trigger Happy's Sam Prebble tells me over call. "That game's development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

In her review, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt "small, cold and unlived in". I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with Kiwi Talkz podcast (cheers VGC for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.

The mention comes after the IPTV provider, which is mainly popular in Latin America, boldly applied for a U.S. trademark. This trademark is unlikely to be granted without protest, but that doesn't seem to be a major issue; the service has already rebranded itself as FlujoTV.

But 'tis the start of the year and I felt like I had a duty to give some of them a proper whirl and see what's what. Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.

It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

Through a legal procedure, adult entertainment company FANZA 'confiscated' the MissAV.com domain, as well as ThisAV.com. However, MissAV swiftly bounced back on a new domain.

I once read in a book that you shouldn't really believe anything you read in a book until you've checked at least two other books. Unfortunately, those two books both said the same thing, meaning I had to check four more. If anyone knows what every book ever written says on the subject, do let me know. I'm trapped now.

Very little, I suspect. We here are like the chalk cliffs of the South Downs: bright and imposing and subject to inevitable but slow erosion by the sea. Or put another way: I'm thinking about bringing back the bulletpoints to separate different links. How are you?

Felipe Pepe wrote about the gentrification of video game history, arguing that American video game history overwrites more local experiences. "We’re not all suburban kids who got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas."

It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

You're on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he'll take your own lord's side in the on-going civil war. But Plot intervenes in the shape of some suspiciously familiar bandits, who slaughter your retinue and reduce Henry and Sir Hans to a pair of shirtless runaways.

The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft are delaying Assassin's Creed Shadows again, but this time, not just out of concern about the quality of Assassin's Creed Shadows. The French publisher are pushing back release of the new samurai-era open worlder from 14th February to 20th March 2025 while they look into "various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders", with news of a possible major "transaction" to follow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I sometimes joke about it, but it's like I need a war to start a new game," Rasheed Abu-Eideh tells me over a call. "The specific thing that made me make Liyla And The Shadows Of War is the attacks on Gaza in 2014, and the specific thing that made me make Dreams On A Pillow is the attacks on Gaza in 2023."
Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about "a land full of people being made into a people without land."

Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn't do it, wrong. I know I've already put you off, so I don't blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn't stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>
