Good June, Good Summer, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that the season is bringing more warmth and brightness to your neck of the woods than mine, and I hope that you've been enjoying all of the news, reveals, and updates offered by the Not-E3 digital entity that is Summer Game Fest.
Frankly, I ain't too down with it. Covering streams is stressful at the best of times, but while E3 required you to go HAM for three days and then coast, SGF marks the start of three straight months of sporadic, randomized showcases. Don't these people know I have a Master Rank to attain?
Still, I hope you've been enjoying the streams and ensuing coverage and, if you're about, then the crew will be on deck on Sunday for the Xbox Games Showcase. Let's see what the Black-and-Green br…]]></summary>

Things just start to quieten down after the release of Tears of the Kingdom and then before you know it, BAM, you walk head first into summer showcase season.
This means that it has been a reasonably busy week at Nintendo Life. We broke down everything announced for the Switch in the Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase (which wasn't all that many titles, but at least we got a first look at Sonic Superstars), dropped the totally tubular news that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge will be getting some new DLC, heard of a fresh batch of titles coming to Nintendo Switch Online, and had a surprise trailer for Pikmin 4.

The Pokémon Company has announced a new "limited-time" distribution for Scarlet and Violet and if you want to claim it, you should probably do it right now.
This time around it's a Bronzong - celebrating the Pokémon Japan Championships. It's available from now until tomorrow (that's 11th June 2023). The code you'll need for this one is 22SEN10RCHAMP (thanks, Serebii.net).

Ahead of the launch of Sonic Origins Plus later this month, Sega has officially lifted the lid on the multiplayer platformer Sonic Superstars. It transports Sonic and his friends to a brand new mystical location known as the North Star Islands.
While the gameplay mostly aims to maintain the "classic" feel, the environments will be made up of various "never-before-seen" zones. Speaking to IGN recently, Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka elaborated on this, explaining how players won't be seeing iconic zones like Green Hill or Chemical Plant in this upcoming side-scroller.

Mortal Kombat 1 represents a clean slate for the long-running fighting game franchise just as the story does for its characters. After the cataclysmic events of Mortal Kombat 11 and its story expansion, Liu Kang has assumed the role of the all-powerful fire god. While he created the world with visions of peace, the Mortal Kombat characters do what they do best in relatively short order, and the blood starts splattering once again.

Last year’s Sonic Frontiers brought Sega’s mascot some much-needed success in the 3D gaming realm, but outside of some segments in the 3D adventures and the externally developed Sonic Mania, the 2D side of the Sonic franchise has been grossly underserviced in recent years. Announced yesterday, Sonic Superstars hopes to give that corner of the Sonic gaming universe a shot in the arm, delivering gorgeous HD visuals, four-player cooperative play, and a bevy of unique Emerald Powers.
However, the announcement was met with a dose of skepticism, as, for many, it immediately conjured memories of th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years wallowing in purgatory, 2011's Shadow of the Damned is getting another shot in the limelight via a remaster. On top of that, developer Grasshopper Manufacture is holding its own E3-style presentation next week.
Shadows of the Damned was the product of a collaboration between Grasshopper's Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), who wrote the game, and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami, who served as a producer. It's a third-person shooter about demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who must rescue his girlfriend after she's abducted by the forces of the underworld with the help of his trusty phallic-joke loving demon, Johnson. The game's bombastic, supernatural action and absurd sense of humor made it generally well-liked upon release (We scored it a 9.25 out of 10 in our review), but it has never been ported beyond its original platforms on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's about to change.


The humorous trailer doesn't reveal any details about the remaster, but we'll likely learn more at the inaugural Grasshopper Direct on June 14. The event celebrates the studios 25th anniversary and kicks off at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET, so fans in the U.S. will have to brew an extra cup of coffee if they want to catch the event live. 
Are you a fan of Shadows of the Damned or does this remaster entice you to give it a shot? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals feels like returning to a familiar place in a great way. I’ve known about the sequel for a couple of years – since Night School Studio announced it in 2021 – but it wasn’t until I went hands-on with it during Summer Games Fest that it dawned on me just how long it’s been since Oxenfree first came out. 
In that seven-year gap, I immediately notice that Oxenfree II is even more beautiful than its predecessor, an already pretty game thanks to its unique visual style. That aesthetic returns, but it pops even more on screen. N…]]></summary>

I simultaneously subscribe to two opposing beliefs about Duke Nukem. The first is that, anecdotally, many people don’t recall or even realize that there were two games starring the character before Duke Nukem 3D. The second is that everyone who owned a capable PC in the early 90s played Duke's first adventures. In either case, Duke Nukem 3D greatly overshadowed the games that came before it.
Apogee’s shareware distribution model meant that the first episode of many of their games were completely free. This put games like Duke Nukem on a lot of hard drives, even before the internet was really widespread. People selling Intel-based PC-compatibles could load the systems up with these games, then advertise them as additional features. Buying a computer for work? Well, the kid…]]></summary>

Something very wicked this way comes, as publisher Team17 and developer The Game Kitchen have announced a release date for their unholy sequel Blasphemous II. The second scripture in this particularly sinful franchise will launch on PC, Switch, and Gen9 platforms on August 24.
Continuing on from the Wounds of Eventide DLC, Blasphemous II follows the continuing adventures of The Penitent One, torn from the grave and thrown back into a terrible cycle of death and return, confronting sinners and ensuring redemption is paid for their actions — usually at the end of a particularly pointy stick. The sequel offers up a vast and entirely new labyrinth, ready and waiting for our protagonist and their array of hideous new weaponry. Of course, a gallery of hellish new enemies awaits, including Blasphemous' memorable and utterly horrible boss battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ7V4RLC4Nw
A new release date trailer (courtesy of IGN) spotlights the Gothic grossness of Blasphemous II's new world, along with its returning bloodlust, highly technical combat, and beautifully ugly environments. For all of you Inquisitors out there, The Game Kitchen's sequel looks to deliver upon the excitement, challenge, and abject misery of the 2019 original, and is set to stain your soul once again.
Blasphemous II launches August 24 on PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.

Even though it shares the name with one of the most popular series of video games of all time, the third season of The Witcher TV series still won't have anything to do with the game's events. Instead, it'll loosely follow the plot of the second novel of Andrzej Sapkowski's series, A Time Of Contempt. Season three will accompany the escalation of the conflict between Nilfgaard and Redania, and also show Geralt and Yennefer as they train Criri in the ways of the Witcher.

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

When I took on review duty for Diablo 4, I knew it would come with some controversy. As someone slightly more critical of the game than the average consensus, I expressed concern with the online requirement and the live service nature of the game. Yet one conversation I absolutely didn’t expect to see post-launch was about the state of the content itself.
Though the game’s barely a week old, the endgame of Diablo 4 has sparked fierce debate. From what I’ve observed, opinions fall into two camps. On one side, you have people who sped through the campaign to get to the endgame. Many here insist that it’s too repetitive, funneling players into a couple of types of content without any notable variety. Others say that the crowd who rushed to the endgame got …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illfonic’s Friday the 13th: The Game is being delisted from storefronts at the end of the year due to an expiring license. 
The developer shared a statement on Twitter revealing the asymmetric multiplayer slasher title will be removed from retail and digital storefronts once the license expires on December 31st. However, the game will still be playable for those who own it through at least the following year, meaning up to December 31, 2024. Until then, Illfonic is dropping the base price of the game to $4.99, and each piece of DLC will cost $0.99.

Friday the 13th: The Game pits a team of players controlling Camp Crystal Lake counselors working together to survive against a player-controlled Jason Voorhees. The game didn’t arrive to the warmest reception when it launched in 2017, but it’s always a bummer to see games disappear, especially when it's at the mercy of IP licensing. Even before this final blow, the game had a rocky existence due to legal disputes with the film's original creators halting the distribution of DLC and, later, the eventual shutdown of its dedicated servers. 
What did you think of Friday the 13th: The Game? Will you be picking it up before it leaves storefronts? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Eager Remnant fans finally had their prayers answered during yesterday's Summer Game Fest presentation, as publisher Gearbox took to the airwaves to announce a release date for the multiplayer shooter — Remnant II will launch July 25 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.
Alongside the new release date, developer Gunfire Games prepared a new trailer, showing off the sequel's new co-op campaign. Up to three players will be able to take up arms against the godly entities that threaten to bring about an end to humanity itself. Much like its predecessor, Remnant II will feature explosive ranged and melee combat, adaptive and home-crafted weaponry, and a huge, procedurally generated world packed out with hordes of strange creatures and domineering boss characters.

And for those fans who wish to take their hype to a whole new level, Gearbox Publishing has opened pre-orders on three editions of the incoming sequel. Alongside a standard digital edition ($49.99), a Deluxe Edition includes additional content in the form of three classic Remnant: From the Ashes armor sets. Finally, an Ultimate Edition ($69.99) also adds a Survival Pack of in-game boosts, the pre-purchase of three upcoming DLC packs, and Early Access to the title, allowing gameplay from June 21. All three editions are available to pre-order now from various retailers.
Remnant II launches July 25 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, Mr. Diablo at Blizzard Rod Fergusson tweeted what the most played class was in Diablo 4 so far. To my great surprise, it wasn't the Rogue, which is currently sitting at the top of our tier list. Rather, it's the Sorcerer, which currently sits at the bottom of our class rankings. Presumably, everyone loves watching ice shards and lightning bolts leave their fingertips. So, is the majority of Diablo 4's player-base wrong, or are we? Feel free to come defend your spell-slinger in the comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Final Chapter
Gun Media has announced that its asymmetrical horror title Friday the 13th: The Game will be delisted this December, following the expiration of the studio's license. The multiplayer massacre will then continue to operate until "at least" the end of 2024 for those who already own it.
Released in the summer of 2017, Friday the 13th: The Game is an adaptation of the classic "slasher movie" series, and sees parties of Crystal Lake camp counselors attempt to stay five steps ahead of the blade of unstoppable serial killer Jason Voorhees. The title has already suffered through licensing issues, which caused the servers to be switched off momentarily in 2020, but it seems that this time, the red tape is far more unkillable than our hockey mask-sporting psycho.
https://twitter.com/Friday13thGame/status/1666811485811806210?s=20
"The time has come, begins a statement posted to the game's official Twitter account. "Our license for Friday the 13th will expire on December 31st, 2023. On that date, Friday the 13th: The Game will no longer be available for sale, both physically and digitally. The game will, however, continue to function through at least December 31, 2024, if you already own it."
Gun Media has reduced the price of the game to five dollars, with all DLC now retailing for a dollar apiece. The publisher is currently preparing the launch of its next release, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Game, which walks a similar path of PvP action, and will see a team of Survivors attempting to outwit the terrifying Sawyer family, led by the horrific butcher, Leatherface.
Friday the 13th: The Game will be delisted on December 31. It is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

But Kvark looks to Half-Life instead of the Doomquake clone era, and is all the better for it. You're a worker/prisoner in a sinister nuclear facility deep under 1980s Czechoslovakia where things, as you might guess, have gone terribly wrong.
The satirical Soviet posters and propaganda reels are here, but used sparingly, and more convincingly than the usual "Russia, haha! Vodka! lol!" fare, and although all its parts are fairly familiar, Kvark feels distinct enough that I had a hard time actually putting it down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like lots of people in the RPS Treehouse right now, I've been squeezing in bits of Diablo 4 around the various Summer Game Fest streams happening this week. I'm having a decent, if mildly monotonous time so far, mostly because I haven't unlocked all my Druid's abilities just yet, but I'm keen to keep going with it, mostly because I just like turning into a bear and a wolf every three seconds to whack some evil skelly boys, innit. When I was logging off the other day, though, I had a fleeting glance at Diablo 4's shop. Not to actually buy anything, I should stress. I'm not one for cosmetics in any shape or form. But I just wanted to see what ludicrous things it was trying to sell me for real human money. And one item for sale was, of course, some fancy horse armour, and it cost six English pounds and thirty nine pence. £6.39! For a mangey rope bridle and a bone dagger on its side! (You can see it in the header image up top there). Ridiculous, I exclaimed, and promptly shut down my PC. 
The next morning, I was talking about this daft bit of armour with the RPS Treehouse when Alice0 suddenly introduced me to the weird and wonderful world of cheap horse games on Steam. After all, why spend upwards of £6 on a pointless cosmetic item when you could feasibly put that money toward 6 whole horse games that have actually dozens of horses in them? So join me as we discover how many horse games you can buy on Steam for the same price as Diablo 4's horse armour.

There was a lot to check out from yesterday's Summer Game Fest, and there's still a lot more to come. We'll be bringing details about what else has been showcased at this year's Geoff Keighley event, but there was definitely one thing of note for horror fans, and those who have been waiting for Alan Wake 2 will probably have already checked out the new gameplay trailer.
If you haven't, the new footage follows protagonist Saga Anderson, an FBI agent sent to investigate a series of murders in Bright Falls. The sequel takes place some 13 years after 2010's Alan Wake, and the recent trailer shown at SGF gives a brief taste of what's to come. With a much creepier vibe than its predecessor, it's one that fans will probably be keeping an eye on. I …]]></summary>

Among the many previews, updates, and release dates revealed during yesterday's Summer Game Fest presentation, Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive offered up new gameplay footage, as well as a release window, for its Games Workshop adaptation Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II, which is coming PC and Gen9 consoles this winter.
Set within the legendary Warhammer universe — which has been entertaining fantasy tabletop fans for generations — Space Marine II is another bombastic and action-packed episode, as the seemingly unkillable Lieutenant Titus leads the charge against the overwhelming forces of the Tyranid Horde. The trailer spotlights blistering melee combat, as well as an array of devastating Imperium firepower, as one-three players team up to take on the title's dramatic co-op campaign. For the Empire!
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II launches this winter on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. A Collector's Edition — containing a copy of the game in SteelBook packaging, a 64-page artbook, and a limited edition statue of Lieutenant Titus in action — is now available to pre-order from the Focus Entertainment store, priced at around $250 USD, not including shipping or additional charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's impossible to determine just how long ago 2014 was. Wisdom would dictate it sits around the 9 year mark, but no one truly believes that. Endless Legend? That was no more than two years ago, and I'll throw hands if anyone suggests otherwise. But apparently enough time has passed that just about every 4X game that came out that year has now been superceded by a newer title in the series. Civilization: Beyond Earth, Galactic Civilizations 3, Age Of Wonders 3, and Endless Legend made 2014 an incredibly strong year for strategy games, but nowadays, who really still plays these older entries?
I don't mean to sound derisive. It's a sombre truth. At 233 hours, I've put more time into Endless Legend than any other 4X strategy game in my Steam library, and loved every minute of it. To this day it's still the best in the genre when it comes to sparking the imagination of my chronically fantasy-loving brain. The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly. It's a simply splendid game. The question is whether it's still worth playing today.

In 2020, the game's dedicated servers were killed, but online play limped on via peer-to-peer matchmaking.

New video game hardware company CRKD has released a stunning-looking new accessory for your Switch which is a step above replacement Joy-Cons or other third-party Joy-Con alternatives.
Showcased by IGN as part of its Summer of Gaming 2023, the Nitro Deck acts as a Joy-Con replacement and a grip for your Switch, fitting perfectly around the sides, back, and bottom of the hybrid console. With an ergonomically designed shell, replaceable joysticks, and the promise of "zero stick drift", it's all sounding extremely tasty.

We've already seen the 3DS eShop closure wipe out a lot of digital titles earlier this year, and now game publisher NIS America has announced two of its games from the Switch eShop will be disappearing in the coming weeks and months.
The first one is the RPG The Lost Child, originally released on the system in 2018, and the other game is God Wars: The Complete Legend - a tactical RPG released in the same year. NIS America hasn't provided any reason as to why these games will "no longer be available" but it does mention how it will apply to both the eShop and PSN across both the US and EU regions.

The Day of the Devs selections usually don't disappoint, and this year's Day of the Devs held after the Summer Game Fest 2023 kick-off stream was solid. Alongside some games we knew of beforehand, there were some exciting new announcements, both from known creators and newer teams in the scene.
From the Chicory team's latest endeavor to a mind-bending world-moving puzzle game, there's a little something of everything. If you missed the stream, or are just looking to find that one game you have a foggy recollection of, here's a recap of everything shown.

Just before Devolver’s Summer Game Fest 2023 stream, Grasshopper Manufacture has given a tease of a remastered version of its 2011 cult classic, Shadows of the Damned.
Uh… the teaser is bizarre, to say the least, but it eventually shows off the goods with a few quick scenes from Shadows of the Damned. It looks to be a remaster in the strictest sense, as those shots certainly smell of the Unreal 3 Engine.
https://youtu.be/xMnx6H91pqg
Beyond that, there isn’t much to see, but more is promised for June 14 at 21:00 PST.
I’m curious to see if Suda51 and Shinji Mikami will be doing anything in terms of “director’s cut” content. Its development was reportedly wrought with corporate interference from EA. But then, I’m not sure if EA is even going to be involved here.
I suppose a straight port to new hardware would be something worthwhile. I wasn’t a huge fan of Shadows of the Damned, even as a fan of Suda51. However, I would probably give it another chance with a remastered version. So, bring it on.
We’ll find out more about it on Wednesday, but for now, we just know that the Shadows of the Damned Remastered is “coming soon.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this week of oh so many announcements, you can't blame anyone for getting carried away and jumping the gun. Unfortunately for Persona developers Atlus, it seems they accidentally announced two games earlier than intended. Eagle-eyed fans say Atlus's Instagram today posted trailers for Persona 3 Reload, a remake of the 2006 RPG, and grid-based tactics spin-off Persona 5 Tactica. While they're no longer on the Insta, folks say they've saved the trailers so you can see them too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day Of The Devs and its indie game festivities returned for this year's Summer Game Fest, once again proving that indie games are good and cool. Quite frankly, it was an hour or so of straight bangers ranging from mind-bending puzzlers to Pokémon-likes to emotionally charged shepherders.
While there's some familiar names in the pack like Hyper Light Drifter and Cocoon, there's a whole host of surprises in there. And that's thanks to the folks over at Double Fine Productions, iam8bit, and PlayStation's indie champion Greg Rice who put all of this together for us to enjoy each year. Below, I've rounded up all the announcements so you can absorb them through your eyeballs and let them rattle around your head until launch.

Chaotic puzzler Human: Fall Flat is getting a sequel and it looks to be just as much of a riot as the first one. Aptly named Human Fall Flat 2 (minus the colon), it looks like this follow-up will take place on different construction sites - the safest of places on Earth for slapstick and silliness to run free. There's not much we can glean from the short trailer that debuted during the Devolver Showcase at this year's Summer Game Fest, but you can have a watch for yourself below.

I had no idea that its creator Bennett Foddy was going to reveal a new game tonight. That game is called Baby Steps, it's being made with the makers of Ape Out, and it looks like a mixture of QWOP and Getting Over It set in a beautiful 3D world. There's an excellent trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone is in trouble
Not only was a Persona 3 remake entitled Persona 3 Reload leaked on Atlus' Instagram, but also a strategy title called Persona 5 Tactica.
https://twitter.com/junoharuto/status/1666934463199059978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1666934463199059978%7Ctwgr%5E1484ee3139010faa9330d607bdb86b9281ddc96c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F06%2Fpersona-5-tactica-launches-17th-november-persona-3-reload-early-2024
As the name implies, Persona 5 Tactica takes the cast of the fifth Persona to the world of tactical RPGs. The trailer makes it sound as though the gang has been transported to another world. A world of tactics, I'm guessing.
The title briefly popped up on Atlus' Instagram page, and the trailer for it was quickly seized and disseminated across the vast expanses of the internet. This occurred simultaneously with Persona 3 Reload which we covered in a previous post. There's no jamming this sleeping bag back in its sack.
While Persona 3 Reload has a much more vague release date, Persona 5 Tactica is slated for November 17, 2023. Currently, only Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC have been announced. However, keep in mind that this looks to have been meant for a Microsoft stream, and they don't typically advertise when a game is also going to be on other platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uh oh!
Try to act surprised later this week when this gets officially announced, but apparently, the Persona 3 remake is real. It's titled Persona 3 Reload,  and if you look quickly, a trailer has been disseminated around the internet.
https://twitter.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1666934712412131330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1666934712412131330%7Ctwgr%5E17a14df9fc20ca028b9e94daa02ecf1d40c0c56c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F06%2Fpersona-5-tactica-launches-17th-november-persona-3-reload-early-2024
A remake of Persona 3 has been rumored for quite a while. Some have speculated that it was partially the reason that we got Persona 3 Portable remastered for modern consoles instead of Persona 3 FES. There were even further leaks later on, but their credibility was somewhat in question. Not totally unbelievable, but not proof positive.
However, it looks like someone on Atlus' Instagram account hit post instead of schedule, and the cat got out of the bag. Not only is Persona 3 Reload on the docket, but there is also another spin-off title headed our way called Persona 5 Tactica.
Persona 3 Reload looks to be a top-to-bottom remake of the classic PS2 title. Currently, it's slated for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in early 2024. Since this looks like it was going to be part of a Microsoft stream, I wouldn't take that as the gospel. They just wouldn't advertise it being on anyone else's platform.

It seems to have been one of those things where a few years back a bunch of devs all noticed that there hadn't been one for a while, but didn't realise they weren't the only ones to have noticed until the games all started coming out. Anyway, Saber Interactive revealed John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, to be published by Focus Entertainment, at tonight's Summer Game Fest. It's an 80s-inspired FPS for up to four players, and you shoot a bunch of zombs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past three months, I've been gasping to tell someone about the next game from the makers of Mutazione. I got to see a sneak peak of it back in March at GDC, but I've been sworn to secrecy ever since. But at long last, Saltsea Chronicles has made its debut at tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, and I can finally unburden myself and let out 90 days' worth of fizz pop excitement for this gorgeous new adventure game. 
Set on a flooded, post-apocalyptic Earth, creative director Hannah Nicklin described it to me like this: "What if you were watching Star Trek, but you get to choose where they go, who's on the adventure and what they get to say?" It's a tantalising premise, especially when it's all packaged up in the same crisp, pastel colour palette as the perpetually stunning Mutazione. The Star Trek reference isn't just for show, either. You might only be visiting different islands rather than whole planets during the course of Saltsea Chronicles, but it does have a natty, Alexander Courage-grade theme tune that plays between its chapters. The most exciting thing about this oceanic trek, however, is its incredibly cool save system that lets you dip in and out of different story branches to explore different paths and opportunities as you see fit. Let me tell you all about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time back I made fun of the preview for Immortals Of Aveum because a) it was quite a silly hands-off preview and b) Immortals Of Aveum is very clearly a game that needs to be played to properly get to grips with it. It's out on July 20th, so not too far away. Have I played it yet? No! Of course not! But we're getting closer to a hands on, and after a six-minute video of the magic FPS in action last month, tonight's Summer Game Fest threw us a big, bombastic boss fight on top of a steampunk Jaeger, or something. I dunno, it was hard to tell over the light show. Those sure are a lot of magical fireworks going off. I like it. Jangle some more keys in front of me, games man.

The video itself is, uh, well, it's not long, and it's quite choppy. While I enjoy a good setpiece, my concerns remain the same as before, i.e. the magic shooting, despite the different flavours of magic broadly corresponding to a different kind of gun, looks pretty weightless, and the enemies look bullet spongey. I do like the colours and the traversal, though.

The "Summer of Gaming," aka "not-E3" kicked off at 3PM ET on June 8, 2023, and our old pal Geoff Keighley was available for more hard-hitting game trailer reveals and lighthearted DoorDash ad reads. Seriously, good recovery on that one!
So what did we get this year? A decent chunk of AAA and indie reveals across a large spectrum of genres, and a big Final Fantasy finish. Naturally, as it is prone to do, Final Fantasy (or more specifically, Final Fantasy 7) stole the show with a "one more thing" and gave us a smoldering Sephiroth shot, as well as confirmation that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is out in 2024 on two discs. I can't wait to see the final installation size.

As part of 2023 Summer Game Fest, Square Enix has shown off a rather heaping helping of gameplay from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
https://youtu.be/mskzZjJjQg0
It looks pretty great! It starts off showing the aftermath of the first game before showing off the world you'll be exploring. There are a number of re-imagined scenes that will be familiar to anyone who played the original title, as well as some new surprises. There's an especially big twist that I don't want to spoil in case you don't want to watch the trailer and prefer to go in blind. I respect that.
Perhaps the most exciting information here is that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is slated for early 2024. But most excitingly is that it's coming on two discs. In this economy? I can't remember the last time I saw a game come on two discs without it actually being two separate titles. Wow!

The story sees Cloud and the gang explore beyond Midgar to stop Sephiroth’s plans, and we see looks at the grander Final Fantasy VII story, likely to be laden with new twists. In terms of new faces, get to see Elena join Reno and Rude in the Turks, and Yuffie, the fiery Wutai ninja introduced in the Intermission story expansion, officially joins the party. 


Perhaps the most surprising revelation is that Rebirth will come on two discs. Given how much storage a single Blu-ray can hold, that suggests that Rebirth could be a mammoth-sized experience, which is wild given that it’s only Part 2 of a planned trilogy of games. We also now know that Rebirth is coming in early 2024 exclusively to PlayStation 5.]]></summary>

We now have our first in-episode footage of Peacock's upcoming live-action adaptation, Twisted Metal. As debuted during this afternoon's Summer Game Fest, the clip featured our ragtag protagonist (Anthony Mackie) squaring off against serial killer clown and poster villain Sweet Tooth (Samoa Joe).
And honestly... it was pretty fucking rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mn4RBWv03A
For some reason, the decision was made to showcase a clip from the show that doesn't actually feature any cars whatsoever. It does, however, feature some daylight-bad punches, sub-MCU comedy, and Sisqo's 1999 hit, The Thong Song. I'm a big Twisted Metal fan, and I absolutely do not mind when other media plays with, rearranges, or even reinvents popular worlds and characters in new and exciting ways.
But this clip was... not good. It wasn't funny, it looked kinda cheap, the displaced Sweet Tooth voice is distracting, and the sense of humor seemed tonally lost both within its own universe and on the silent, slow-clapping Summer Game Fest audience.
Being generous, we'll put this down to a bad choice of clip and see how it all goes down on July 27, when Twisted Metal premieres exclusively on Peacock...
...Imagine the producers: "One rule for the Twisted Metal show reveal. No Cars."

Fae Farm is bursting with charm and unique twists to the hugely popular farm sim genre. The magical twists give way to gorgeous, colourful biomes and unusual crops and plants. The chickens are blue, and you can also encounter magical beings that will befriend you. And it looks like it's all coming together for a cosy blend of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Fantasy Life.

T'is the season for ARPG fans, it appears. Diablo 4 is out, Path of Exile 2 was shown during Summer Game Fest, and now we have another title in the genre competing for our time. In this case, it's Lysfanga from Sand Door Studio, which brings its own twist to the formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDRfAVyW0aw
What will hopefully separate Lysfanga from the competition is a time traveling mechanic. By rewinding time, Lysfangha's protagonist will create specters of her past self that fight alongside her. While we've seen similar mechanics in other games, it's still a neat concept to see pop up across different genres.
While a release date was not nailed down, we did get a reveal that the title would arrive later this year on PC via Steam and Epic Games.

Epic has been teasing the new battle pass skins all week. In addition to Optimus Prime, we see people wielding some glowing blue weapons, a Nathan Drake-type, and a new version of Meowscles wearing a Tiger-striped shirt. You can check out all the new skins below.

After 13 years the sort of Twin Peaksy, sort of Stephen Kingy action adventure game is getting a much-requested sequel this October 17th, although this time it's a survival horror, and Alan is sharing screen time equally with an FBI agent co-protagonist. Lake told us a little bit more about said agent Saga Anderson, leading into a first glimpse of "raw gameplay" (as opposed to cooked?) that showed her in action. I have to say, my first impression is that Saga is a terrible FBI agent who is going to ruin the chain of evidence if this ever goes to court because this woman will not put on gloves to handle a goddamn thing.

Previously announced during the September 2022 Nintendo Direct, Fae Farm is again in the spotlight at Summer Game Fest. On top of a September 8, 2023 release date, it's also been revealed that it is coming to PC as well as the Switch.
https://youtu.be/Ro-bft9PF9A
The trailer shows off not only the farming, but also the magical hijinks you'll get up to. It's looking pretty cute, and it certainly shows off more technical chops than, say, Stardew Valley. It looks pretty friendly, if Stardew Valley wasn't friendly enough already. It has 4-person multi-player, if you need extra incentive.
Fae Farm is coming to PC and Switch on September 8, 2023.

        <updated>2023-06-08T20:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Summer Games Fest, we got our first extended look at gameplay for Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
As previously revealed, Gaiden takes place between the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon, filling in the gaps of what longtime series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma was up to after faking his own death in the former before reappearing in the latter. 
From the looks of it, Kiryu, now being called "Codename Joryu," has been running jobs for a mysterious someone. As you might expect, this mainly means he's beating the holy hell out of dudes in the street. The trailer shows a variety of large-scale fights, as well as Kiryu's new fighting abilities, which include a rope-type weapon he can use to bring items and people closer to him.
Check out the trailer below:


As pointed out by Gematsu, Gaiden gameplay details actually leaked yesterday on the PlayStation Store. Here are some of the key details:
"Dynamically switch between the Yakuza and Agent fighting styles in visceral melee combat.
"With the Yakuza style, strike fear into enemies by unleashing wildly aggressive moves powered by Kiryu’s unparalleled strength and flair.
"Or up the ante with the Agent style by delivering blows with absolute speed and precision, while using an array of high-tech gadgets like electrified bind wires to stun enemies then send them flying.
"Strategically adapt to the situation and leverage both styles to dominate and destroy hordes of enemies."
"Whether you’re brawling in the secret Castle arena, singing a new karaoke song, enjoying a drink at the live-action cabaret club, or racing in the pocket circuit, the world offers a variety of immersive experiences.
"An intriguing informant named Akame also provides thrilling sub-missions, drawing you into an epic showdown that unfolds the more you explore and enjoy Sotenbori, Yokohama and the mysterious Castle."
Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will be released on November 9, 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sick of losing cubes in Marvel Snap? This newest game mode might be the solution to your problems. Today during Summer Game Fest, Second Dinner's Chief Development Officer Ben Brode took to the stage to announce that Conquest, Marvel Snap's newest mode, will launch on June 13. The news was accompanied by a promotional skit featuring SungWon Cho, who you might recognize as Ratatoskr from God of War: Ragnarök. You can watch the trailer below.


Conquest Mode works similarly to Marvel Snap's Battle Mode. Two players are matched up for a series of games, each with ten units of health. Instead of wagering cubes, the currency players use to gain levels in the standard ranked mode, Conquest will have players wagering health. Unlike Battle Mode, which ends as soon as one player runs out of health, Conquest has players progress through tiers of competition, requiring longer winning streaks the higher they get. As a reward for making it to the top, players will receive exclusive cosmetics.
“It’s just insane how good players have gotten at Marvel Snap since we launched in the fall," Brode said in a press release. "For our most competitive, high-skilled players, we wanted to give them the ultimate challenge with Conquest. Players can now find out who truly is the best of the best and worthy of ultimate Marvel Snap glory!! What’s also super cool about Conquest is that the Proving Grounds can double as a great way to try out new decks, as Conquest has no impact on a player's Marvel Snap season rank."
Marvel Snap recently started its "Spider-Versus" season, which will introduce new cards such as Ghost-Spider, Spider-Ham, and Silk. The game is currently available on PC and Mobile devices and made it onto the list of our top ten games of 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoenix Labs, the studio behind Dauntless, unveiled a much different project in the form of Fae Farm last year. As the name suggests, it's a cozy farming simulator that adds spellcasting to the mix, and a new trailer premiering during Summer Game Fest revealed it is launching on September 8.
Fae Farm takes place in the magical realm of Azoria, which requires your green thumb to help restore it to its former glory. That means tilling the land to grow crops, gathering resources by exploring, and decorating your homesteads both inside and out. You can farm alone or enlist help by inviting friends in online multiplayer (as well as locally on Switch). Check out some of the activities the game offers in the gameplay trailer video below.


Fae Farm will be available on Switch and PC via Steam and The Epic Game Store.]]></summary>

As part of Summer Game Fest 2023, Pocketpair has shown off more of Palworld, a “multi-player, open world, survival, crafting game,” that is definitely looking just like “Pokemon with guns.” Just look at that art style. Beyond that, it’s been revealed that it will be released into Early Access in January 2024.

Along with this is a new trailer that hammers home how much Pokemon Palworld is going for. There’s fantasy, adventure, children, and then someone pulls out a minigun. I really can’t say I don’t see the appeal, but it’s hard not to raise an eyebrow at its intentionally derivative nature.
Palworld will be coming to PC via Early Access sometime in January 2024.

While we didn't get any new gameplay footage, we got two new pieces of concept art featuring the game's main villains, Kraven and Venom.
Venom was revealed in the original trailer for Spider-Man 2, but we didn't see anything more than his face at the very end. This art is our first look at Insomniac's take on the character. When asked about his identity, Intihar would only say that it was not Eddie Brock, leaving the man inside the symbiote a mystery. But if you've played 2018's Spider-Man, you've probably got a good guess as to who's inside. For the full interview, check out the video below.


Additionally, we got an official release date. You can check out a map twice as big as the last with twice the web-slingers when Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launches on PS5 on October 20, 2023.]]></summary>

The fun part of a showcase like Summer Game Fest is seeing how each game company handles its reveals.
Some opt for grandiose trailers to tingle our imaginations. But for Marvel's Spider Man 2, it needs no such fanfare. They simply had game director Bryan Intihar come on stage, talk about a few details, and then the bombshell drops. Marvel's Spider Man 2 launches on October 20, 2023. The crowd goes wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9ym7wYf28
While a simple release date could stand on its own as a major reveal, we also gleaned some juicy new details about the upcoming PS5 exclusive. For example, Venom is "not Eddie Brock," as Intihar asserts that the team wanted to tell an original story with this title. Additionally, we also received news that the city "pretty much doubled in size." Pretty exciting!
Following the show, a post on the PlayStation blog confirms that pre-orders for the game will open on June 16. As has become common for major game releases, we have a few editions of the game to choose from. There's of course the standalone game for $69.99. For $79.99, we also have the Digital Deluxe edition, which comes with "2 additional skill points" and a handful of cosmetics.

That said, hardcore fans can sling for the $229.99 Collector's Edition, which contains a Steelbook case and a 19 inch statue of Venom fending off the Spider Men. Only a digital voucher for the game in this one though, which tickles my funny bone.
It's a tough act to follow a huge critical hit like the original Marvel's Spider Man, but it seems the team at Insomniac Games wants to surpass all expectations. We'll see how it measures up when Marvel's Spider Man 2 launches on October 20.

Last year we got word that The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was in the works, and will deal with events taking place in the Fourth Age of the Lord of the Rings timeline (beyond the events of the core books). That's a pretty big deal, as that era of the franchise is rarely touched upon, even by Tolkien himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXvqhpGj6Gs
Well, we got another look at it today thanks to Summer Game Fest 2023, where it got a quick trailer segment. Even after that bit of footage, I still don't really have any idea of whether or not this will be good. Hey, even if it's not up to snuff, it'll be really hard to top Gollum was the "worst Lord of the Rings game" this year. That's something to look forward to!
The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria currently has a fall 2023 release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios clearly wanted another easily detestable bad guy for Baldur’s Gate 3, so it turned to Harry Potter’s Lucius Malfoy to play one of the game's newly revealed antagonists. 
That would be actor Jason Isaacs, who portrayed the father of Harry Potter rival Draco Malfoy in the films. Isaacs will take the role of Lord Enver Gortash, designer of the Steel Watchers, magical warriors tasked with protecting Baldur’s Gate after Duke Ravengard vanishes. Players will bump heads with this powerful enforcer as they find themselves in the middle of a power struggle engulfing the city. You can see his introduction in the trailer below. 


"It was a thrill to join the Baldur’s Gate universe but I fear that the magnificent Lord Enver Gortash is being mischaracterized as a villain," says Isaacs in a press release. "In a brutal world of betrayals and butchery, he’s learned to lie better and backstab first. The joy in voicing him - apart from the obvious pleasure in getting to look so glorious - was that the creative team and I got to play loose enough to find ways that he could enjoy the ride and make the players hate him more!"
Isaac isn’t the only famous name players will encounter. J.K. Simmons (Portal 2's Cave Johnson, Spider-Man's J. Jonah Jameson) was previously revealed as General Ketheric Thorm. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 launches on August 31 for PlayStation 5 and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(And featuring a bad Bon Jovi cover)
During Summer Game Fest, Saber Interactive revealed brand new monster shooter Toxic Commando, which is headed to PC and Gen9 consoles in 2024.
The trailer sees a pack of bastards gunning the engine through a throng of terrifying mutants, using all manner of wild weaponry to cut a swathe through hordes of decaying flesh. While en masse zombie shooters are not exactly few and far between, Toxic Commando is being produced by director (and passionate video game fan) John Carpenter, who is behind such movies as Halloween, The Thing, and Prince of Darkness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqY8YoOkmIo
It will be interesting to see how Carpenter's influence instills itself in the final product, and hopefully helps Toxic Commando to break away from the typical first-person chaos of the many previous co-op zombie shooters that have come before. We still have a while to wait, as Toxic Commando will not be with us until some point in 2024, but given its Gen9 exclusivity and pedigree producer, it's an exciting prospect, guaranteeing a somewhat splatteriffic release.
Toxic Commando launches next year on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld has always seemed too good to be true, given its vibrant world and amazingly absurd premise of inserting guns and survival features into a Pokémon-inspired open-world game. After a long wait, fans will finally get to try it for themselves early next year.
Developer Pocketpair revealed during Summer Game Fest that Palworld is launching in Steam Early Access in January. A long wait to be sure (especially since the game was last slated to enter Early Access this year), but we'll take any proof that this game is a real thing because it continues to look bonkers. 


Palworld takes place in a world where players can catch and befriend cute, legally-distinct monsters called Pals. The game features an open world that supports multiplayer (up to 8 players) where you can have Pals give a helping hand in battles or in exploration, put them to work making resources in your factories, sell them off, or just eat them. Combat unfolds as a third-person shooter with players wielding assault weapons and other guns to blast enemy Pals and other threats, or you can use Pal’s unique abilities to get the job done. In multiplayer, you can explore together, trade Pals, or steal each other's monsters and items in battle. 
What do you think of this latest look at Palworld? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 got its first unedited gameplay showing during Summer Game Fest, with Remedy head Sam Lake divulging more details on the upcoming survival horror title.
Sam Lake offered further details on previously revealed factoids about Alan Wake 2. The game lets you play as Alan and newcomer FBI agent Saga, who each sport separate but connected campaigns. Players can switch between the two at any time, with Saga exploring the pacific northwest while Alan tries to escape the Dark Place. Since players can change characters freely, this opens up a plethora of storytelling differences; you can even play the full game as one character if you choose. 
The sequel’s shift to pure survival horror is shown off with the game’s heavy Resident Evil vibes as Saga riddles a terrifying killer with bullets while dodging his attacks. The trailer ends with some investigative gameplay, but we don’t get a long look at this part of the experience.


Alan Wake 2 launches on October 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via The Epic Game Store.]]></summary>

As part of Summer Game Fest, Nexon has shown off a slice of their upcoming smashy medieval-fantasy multi-player game, Warhaven. They have also revealed that it will be free to try out as part of Steam Next Fest.
The trailer sure is a lot. A guy gets clobbered and dies. Then he’s revived. Then things get all explodey, and a bunch of dudes get knocked around. Oh, man. It sure looks like a thing.
https://youtu.be/hiJjooA4Vlc
I had to actually turn to its now-live Steam page to really figure out what I was supposed to be seeing. Warhaven touts 36-player battles and gives emphasis to its tactical side. It looks like a MOBA, and sure enough, in the steam tags, it says MOBA. Its art style reminds me of a less grim Souls game.
Warhaven will be free-to-play, and you’ll have a chance to try it out as part of Steam Next Fest (coming next week). The full release is planned for Fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Summer Game Fest gave us a first look at Sand Land, the new game from Bandai Namco, based on a manga by celebrated artist, Akira Toriyama.
The new game boasts a gorgeous art style that is unmistakably rooted in Toriyama’s style, and seems to mix action, vehicles, and fighting game mechanics together to tell a story set in a mysterious desert world.
It’s unknown at this point if the game will follow the same thread as the original manga. If it does, the story will follow a former general named Sheriff Rao as he tries to overcome a corrupt king with the help of the demon prince Beelzebub and his friend Thief. The three work together (including stealing a tank) to bring water back to a parched world.
There’s still much to learn about the video game adaptation, but the announcement trailer looked beautiful. Sand Land is headed to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but no word yet on release date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Sonic Team have announced Sonic Superstars, a new 2D adventure starring the company's Blue Blur. Though Sonic is the star, as the name implies, there are plenty of supporting cast members. In this reveal trailer, we also see Tails, Knuckles, and Amy appear as playable characters, each with their own unique abilities.
For the first time since Sonic Adventure, original Sonic the Hedgehog designer and artist Naoto Ohshima returns to the franchise. As the original designer of the Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman characters, he will bring an all-new character to the franchise through Sonic Superstars. 
Sonic Superstars also introduces seven different Emerald Powers. In the trailer, we see Sonic create clones of himself and climb waterfalls, but the press release also teases "powering up." 
Taking place on the North Star Islands, Sonic Superstars purports to deliver never-before-seen environments, hinting that, despite the compilation-style name, we will be speeding through all new levels instead of the usual suspects like Green Hill and Chemical Plant. The press release teases enormous creatures and evil plans from Dr. Eggman, while Fang the Sniper (AKA Nack the Weasel) from Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic the Fighters, and other games seems to appear as a secondary enemy.
In the trailer, we also see what look to be Special Stages that borrow from the rotating Special Stages from Sonic 1, plus a 3D Special Stage. The modernized HD graphics look great in motion, but the proof will be in how it plays, particularly following how disappointed many in the community were by Sonic the Hedgehog 4. If Sonic Team is able to nail the physics, momentum, and overall feel, Sonic Superstars could do for the 2D Sonic series what New Super Mario Bros. did for the 2D Mario series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, over four years since the last entry in the series, we finally got a clear look at Mortal Kombat 1. Shown at Summer Game Fest, the trailer shows off a lot of gameplay, confirming a number of fighters: Scorpion, Sub Zero, Liu Kang, Kenshi, Kitana, Mileena, Raiden, and Kung Lao. You can watch the full reveal trailer below.


The ending of Mortal Kombat 11 allowed NetherRealm to rework the series a little bit, so this newest entry serves as a reboot of sorts. Classic characters have been put into new scenarios and have new relationships. For example, long-time rivals Scorpion and Sub-Zero are brothers now, and Liu Kang is a god of fire. Additionally, Johnny Cage is now being played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, an actor that inspired the creation of the original Mortal Kombat games.
Kameo fighters put an additional spin on the series' canon, with classic versions of characters like Kano, Sonya, and Jax jumping in to fight by your side. The new mechanic acts as an additional way to customize your characters, with a second roster available to choose as a Kameo after selecting your main fighter. While some fighters will likely be exclusive to the Kameo selection, Ed Boon has clarified that there will be some overlap – Sub-Zero can serve as both a Kameo and a normal fighter.
Mortal Kombat 1 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 19.]]></summary>

The news comes alongside a new gameplay trailer that premiered during Summer Game Fest, which shows off even more of the game's occult-themed gunplay. 


Witchfire is being developed by The Astronauts, the team behind The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and centers on an alternate universe war between powerful witches and the Vatican church, with the player working for the latter to hunt down the former. The gameplay blends first-person shooting with supernatural abilities bestowed by the church. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz explained in an Epic Games blog post that the early access version will focus on fine-tuning gameplay first and foremost, with story elements being introduced over time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recently-released Street Fighter 6 and the soon-to-be-released Exoprimal are getting a crossover event in the fall, as announced today during Summer Games Fest. 
Details are a bit scarce right now, but in the trailer, we see mecha-inspired Ryu talking with Exoprimal's artificial intelligence, Leviathan, who welcomes the fighter to Bikitoa Island. We also catch a glimpse of Ryu fighting dinosaurs. Ostensibly, all of this takes place within Exorpimal. It's to be determined if any of the crossover content will come to Street Fighter 6. The trailer concludes with a glimpse of Guile also showing up to Bikitoa, but concludes without any further info.
Check it out below:


While Exoprimal is out on July 14, the Street Fighter collab isn't expected until this fall. Interestingly, it's being billed as "Capcom Collab 1," implying future collaborations in the future, though no details were given.

One of the big guaranteed numbers at Summer Game Fest 2023 was a first look at Mortal Kombat 1's gameplay. And it's exactly what you expect from the franchise — ramped up to 11.
The trailer (which is almost definitely not Switch gameplay) looks utterly fantastic. Some of the fighters we got a good look at today were Kenshi, Mileena, Kitana, Liu Kang, Scorpion, Sub Zero, and — of course — Johnny Cage, who is being played by action movie star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Mortal Kombat creator (kreator?) Ed Boon confirmed the news on the stage after the trailer debuted, part of which was spent in Cage's house.

Well, Geoff and his freshly pressed Summer Game Fest trainers have only gone and done it for them, and wouldn't you know it, it's a new Prince Of Persia game called The Lost Crown. Sorry, Sands Of Time Remake, you're old news now.
But even before Geoff got his pristine reveal mitts on it (probably), I went to see and play this new Prince Of Persia game over at Ubisoft Montpellier - and if the reveal trailer hasn't already convinced you this is something special, take it from me: this is rad as heck, and you can read more of my thoughts about it after its full reveal at Ubisoft Forward next Monday. Until then, though, here's everything else I can share about it right now, so ready yourselves for some cold, hard factoids. Here we go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer Game Fest 2023 opened its show with an impressive, unexpected announcement. The remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is still in development, but Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a wholly new title that feels a bit closer to Prince's original 2D roots.


The gameplay showed an impressive mix of flashy combat and high-speed platforming – much faster then the methodical platforming that inspired it. The protagonist, who has historically always just been called the Prince, looks a bit like his Sands of Time iteration, but otherwise appears to be a totally new character named Sargon. Regarding the story a press release for the game reads, "In this brand-new adventure, players will embody Sargon, a young, gifted warrior, member of an elite group called The Immortals. As they are sent to rescue Prince Ghassan, they will explore Mount Qaf, a once wondrous place, now cursed and hostile. Sargon and his brothers-in-arms will soon discover that time itself will be a treacherous foe and that the world balance must be restored." The press release also says the game is inspired by "the Metroidvania structure".
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown releases January 16 on Switch, PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Amazon Luna and PC through the Epic Games Store and the Ubisoft Store. Ubisoft promises to reveal more during its Monday stream event.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Razer Deathadder V3 Pro is an incredible high-end gaming mouse, but it's expensive at $150 new. That's why it's worth noting that used models are now available on Amazon for $79, nearly half-price! For that, you get a lightweight 64g mouse with a right-handed ergonomic design, 3rd-gen optical switches, HyperSpeed wireless and 90 hours of battery life - a pretty convincing spec sheet!

You can now pick up a 1TB P44 Pro for just $65, an excellent deal for a PCIe 4.0 drive of this calibre, complete with TLC NAND and a DRAM cache. To get the deal price, just use code SSCT833 at Newegg.

I wasn’t really going to bother with Blizzard’s latest click-em-up (seriously, why is there so much mouse clicking??) but I’ve since joined in with the treehouse’s Diablo 4 spree and turns out that maybe there is a reason for me to play Diablo after all. Her name is Lilith.
Lilith is great. She’s a tall demon queen with giant horns, has a major chip on her shoulder, and she’s out to destroy both Heaven and Hell. She seems like the kind of gal who would eat a bunch of babies and puppies as a snack, and I love that for her. It’s great that Blizzard decided to finally bench the titular demon himself and let his terrifying niece have her moment in the spotlight instead.

Plus, this week we have once again been playing current video games, and Nate returns with an extremely silly mini-game. In the hardware section James lets us in on the unlikely second wind for VR headsets, most notably Apple's extremely stupid fake face projection thing. Please, Silicon Valley: stop.

The tweets are all in a Q&A style format, and most of the questions have been fairly innocuous things like "Will FF7 Rebirth have original music?" and "Has the battle system changed from FF7 Remake?" But the answers, at least on the English FF7 Twitter account, have been downright baffling, and have been promptly memed into oblivion. Things will happen to characters during the story, you say? No kidding! 
But thanks to some clever internet sleuthing, eager Final Fantasy fans are quickly realising that there's a lot more to these comments than meets the eye. Well, at least there is in the original Japanese versions of them. The English translation team clearly didn't get the same memo...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had one question for Mask Of The Rose: Can I smooch the Cthulhu monster? I mean, I assume you can, they’re one of ten characters you’re able to romantically pursue in the delicious depths of this Eldritch dating sim. But in actuality, I simply don't know, because after ten-plus hours and multiple playthroughs, that all-important question remains unanswered. It’s not something unique to my dashing, tentacled suitor, either. Many of my romantic pursuits in the Neath totally fizzled out. It's giving Berocca when I wanted Coke and Mentos.
Mask Of The Rose is Failbetter’s visual novel dating sim set in the Fallen London universe, an already established alt-history Victorian London that the studio has been building over a decade as a quite excellent browser game. In this alternative history,  London has been dragged through the Earth’s crust by bats and now resides in a vast underground cavern called the Neath. With the economy literally in the pits and Queen Vicky refusing to leave her cushy palace, London has become somewhat unruly, turning into a lasciviously gothic underworld home to a whole parade of monsters, devils, living statues, cloaked beings with red eyes... basically the entire cast of the Goosebumps books.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!

Today we're righting that (minor) wrong, as we feature a 550W power supply slapped with a healthy $45 Amazon discount - bringing it down to $60. 
The PSU in question is the Cooler Master V550 Gold V2, an 80+ Gold rated unit with a semi-modular design that comes in a fetching white colourway. It's well-rated by reviewers and suitable for mid-range systems, and thanks to this limited time deal it's way cheaper than anything else similar on the market!

More importantly, the cold vastness of space is in this case a number of bright colours that make me think of the universe as a big Slush Puppie that I just want to shlorp up.

It’s unknown what state the game is in, but an FAQ reveals that launch information will be shared in the September update. Additionally, the game’s new developer will be named as well.

ThroughLine Games should give that a go, because here they are announcing a new game in the same world as 2019's platforming adventure Forgotton Anne. It's a parallel universe where forgotten items, known as forgotlings come to life and endeavour to be remembered again. This new game, due out in 2024, is actually called Forgotlings, and you play as one called Fig in a similarly actiony platformy adventure in a 2D "semi open-world Metroidvania". Fig is, by the way, an artist's wooden posing doll, and even though he has a head his face is in his torso. I find this greatly distressing and will not stand for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While out visiting EA Sports to get the lowdown on Madden NFL 24, I had the chance to speak with senior producer Mike Mahar. During our conversation, we veered onto the topic of EA Sports College Football, the revitalization of the long-running college-focused football franchise that ended with NCAA Football 14. In 2021, EA Sports announced the return of its college football franchise, but this time, leaving the NCAA name behind. In a somewhat humorous moment during the interview, when I mentioned "the return of the NCAA Football franchise," Mahar is quick to correct me that it's "College Football." 
We also dove into what it's like to develop an annualized title, along with the decisions that come with that. You can read those portions of the conversation below.

Madden NFL 23 effectively pushed the ball downfield for EA Sports' long-running franchise. Though the implementation of the foundational FieldSense system, which revamped how the gameplay feels on both sides of the ball, was solid, much like any rookie, it was clear it still needed to develop in order to reach its full potential.
Madden NFL 24 carries forward the gameplay improvements from last year while adding some exciting additions to modes like Franchise and the single-player-focused career mode. I traveled to Electronic Arts in Redwood Shores, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge keeps the ninja party going with the reveal of its Dimension Shellshock DLC. Launching later this year, this upcoming add-on takes the Turtles and their friends through time and space to take on new threats with the help of a familiar ally.
Ronin rabbit Usagi Yojimbo joins the game as a playable character. The samurai warrior has starred in his own self-titled comic series since the ‘80s, but many mainstream fans are likely familiar with him from his numerous crossover appearances in TMNT media over the decades. The trailer shows off Usagi’s formidable prowess with his katana, such as piercing through multiple foes with a single sword thrust. 


Dimension Shellshock also adds an unspecified new game mode, new tracks from composer Tee Lopes, and a fresh set of color schemes for the playable roster. Shredder’s Revenge is also getting another, separate free update that adds another batch of color palette options.
We’ll have to wait to learn more about Dimension Shellshock, but we’re excited to get our hands on it given the exceptional base game. You can read more about our thoughts on TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge by reading our review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As well as it runs on your average desktop PC, it wasn’t until I began playing Diablo IV on the Steam Deck that its demon-thwacking really clicked for me. Largely because this was my first experience of it with gamepad controls, and using thumbsticks and face buttons to move and toss out spells just feels more... I don't know, direct? Like I’m actually controlling my Necromancer and her boney bodyguards, not just clicking a unit and watching their animations.
It helps that Diablo IV’s Steam Deck performance is surprisingly spry, with fast 45-60fps framerates within reach even when leaving the majority of graphics settings on Ultra quality. Unlike all of the other best Steam Deck games, there’s no native support for its Battle.net launcher, but with some resourcefulness, that needs only be a temporary barrier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some games adapt to VR more naturally than others. Games that take place primarily in a cockpit, like Elite Dangerous or Euro Truck Simulator 2, need relatively little adjustment to make them enjoyable in VR. They don't require the player to move around much, and their whole shtick about providing an authentic, immersive experience. 


Games that require a lot of fast movement, or require the player to keep track of a lot of different objects, are generally harder to make work through VR Goggles. Hence why Amid Evil VR caught my attention. Shooters are common VR fodder, but they're typically built as VR experiences from the ground up. Amid Evil, on the other hand, is a flatscreen retro shooter designed to be reactive, surreal, and above all, fast. It's a game where you zip around arcane dimensions like a magic missile, splattering weird little armoured guys with enchanted swords and a staff that fires planets. It's a brilliant game, one of the best old-skool shooters to emerge from the genre's revival. But on paper, it's about as VR friendly as Morpheus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all the roguelike deckbuilders that have followed in Slay The Spire's footsteps, Wildfrost is my second favourite. The cardplay never quite reaches the dizzy heights of Spire or Monster Train, but it's far cuter than either of them and still absolutely splendid. Now's a great time to pick it up, too, because its first big update is primarily aimed at clarifying rules to help new players avoid all the painful deaths I suffered through. 
Developers Deadpan Games have released a roadmap, too, revealing a rough plan for what they're working on next.

The moment it happened was captured on stream, and you can watch it for yourself in this clip on Carn's Twitch channel, aptly titled "rip?".
Former Starcraft and Dota pro "cArn" has won the race to hit level 100 on a Diablo 4 Hardcore character, thus earning him a letter from the king and a nap. This is Diablo's permadeath mode, where one death is enough to wipe your progress. He dinged his final ding on his Barbarian in the early hours of June 5th, just five days after the game's early access launch, and he's now been officially confirmed as the first Hardcore centurion. It's a feat that sounds as impressive as it does exhausting.

As the genre has progressed through the generations, sports video games have become increasingly complicated as they add more wrinkles to their team management tools and more depth to their on-the-field action. Super Mega Baseball 4 harkens back to the sports games of the mid-90s, bringing streamlined gameplay and astounding levels of customization while introducing novel concepts. But though the throwback approach is sound in many ways, it does come with some concessions.

That might be part of the reason why Lisa has remained a cult classic, even if it has overwhelmingly positive reviews from those who persevered with the punishing, deranged, tragicomic RPG Maker game.

Now it's 2023 and Lisa: The Painful is getting a Definitive Edition re-release, and I'm lucky that I can draw on better known references. It's like Undertale by way of... Uh, thecatamites?

From its humble 1987 Final Fantasy I beginnings to this year’s upcoming tentpole release, Final Fantasy XVI, the series has, in some way, shape, or form, remained prominent for decades. Part of its success likely comes from how easy it is to get into any new mainline game, which is to say every new entry stands alone (save for the few direct sequels). Final Fantasy II isn’t a direct sequel to Final Fantasy I, just like Final Fantasy VII isn’t one to Final Fantasy VI.

It's only recently come out, so we're fresh to death this time - literally, because in it you're trapped in a mansion full of SAW-esque murder-puzzles. I really enjoyed this game, with its low-poly PS1 style, and its vibe of being an early 00s thriller that would probably star e.g. Morgan Freeman hunting down a twisted serial killer played by e.g. Hugh Jackman. But in this metaphor, I am the twisted monster, and I have trapped both you and my colleagues and am forcing you all to play this game I like.

The series' visuals fall somewhere between realism and fantasy, and it’s always fun to see how Square Enix studios leverage more powerful hardware to bring worlds to life. These settings, characters, and monsters are memorable, and a large reason for that is the art. It’s striking and unique – you know it’s Final Fantasy when you see it. 
With each new Final Fantasy, Square Enix has a chance to solidify characters and worlds into the zeitgeist of gaming, like the company has done in the past with Final Fantasy VII’s Cloud Strife, Final Fantasy X’s Zanarkand, and more. During my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices, I spoke to Final Fantasy XVI art director Hiroshi Minagawa about how developer Creative Business Uni…]]></summary>

This news comes by way of a new Pikmin 4 trailer released today, which sets up the story of the game and shows off what its customization options look like. As for the story, you play as a rescue explorer sent to a mysterious planet to rescue not one crew but two, each from a separate crashed ship. Before landing, though, you'll need to customize your explorer, and today's trailer indicates you can change their head shape, body shape, face, hair, clothes, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the new Pikmin 4 trailer: 


Pikmin 4 hits Switch on July 21, 2023.

The Diablo vibes are strong, it has some neat ideas for the genre, and it has a demo you can try for free. I only wish it drew a little more inspiration from Diablo and a little less from Survivors 'em up conventions.

Diablo IV successfully tempts me to gleefully indulge in sin at every turn. A thrilling hunt for rare loot feeds my insatiable greed and lust for power. The satisfaction of slaughtering thousands of foes, supernatural or otherwise, leaves little room for remorse. Whether taking down the forces of darkness alone or with friends, this is a massive and deeply engrossing action RPG that keeps me coming back for more dozens upon dozens of hours later.

Although, I suppose it actually is, because Rebirth is set in 1937, and Amnesia: The Bunker is effectively a bottle episode taking place during the First World War. And what a bottle episode! You'll spend 4-6 hours being chased around the tunnels of a maze-like bunker, winding up a dim, rubbish torch and reading increasingly unhinged diary notes from the French soldiers who've all been eaten, and boy will you have a great time.

Capcom also notes in its announcement that this showcase serves as a special digital event to celebrate its 40th anniversary.
The publisher-developer has had a great 2023 so far between releases like Resident Evil 4 Remake and the recently released Street Fighter 6, both of which faired extremely well with both critics and fans. Perhaps this showcase will reveal how Capcom plans to keep that momentum going with upcoming and future releases. Only time will tell.

Now you can get even high-models for less than £1000, including this HP Omen machine which includes a 16.1-inch 1440p 165Hz display, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and Ryzen 7 6800H CPU for £972 on Amazon. 
The same machine retailed for £1629 in March this year, so this is a huge bargain - especially given that this is still hugely a powerful machine for 1440p gaming. The spec even includes a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, so it's a convincing machine from top to bottom.

Complete Priority Quests Immediately
Diablo IV has three types of color-coded quests: Story (yellow), Side (blue), and Priority (white). Priority quests are, as the name implies, important because they introduce new game mechanics, such as a new type of store opening up or unlocking a mount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s a single upside to the collapsing standards of technical competence among big-budget PC games, it’s that when something like Diablo 4 comes along and simply performs well, there’s an almost pleasant relief to it. Like your bus arriving on time, a minute after watching the previous, late-arriving one flip onto its roof attempting a handbrake turn.  
It’s not perfect, but Diablo IV does run smoothly for the most part (also sorry Google, but I'm going back to Roman numberals), and its system requirements on PC are as likely to involve museum pieces as they are the latest and priciest graphics cards. I’ve put some hours into the early access build and have come up with a best settings guide, but in truth, this will likely just optimise your framerates – Diablo IV’s higher quality settings rarely trouble it, especially at 1080p.

Last week, Square Enix and the official Final Fantasy VII Twitter account began releasing new details about the upcoming sequel, answering one question each day. On day one, we learned Rebirth is "progressing smoothly." Day 2 and Day 3 were less exciting, teasing that players will have a "high degree of freedom, experiencing a myriad of different stories" and that players "will witness a chain of narrative events that lie at the very heart of the Final Fantasy VII story." 
For Day 4, the question is: Do I need to play Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? And here's Toriyama's answer: "No – we have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth."

If I had to guess, Rebirth will feature an introductory cutscene or minimovie that summarizes the events of the first game but only time will tell.
Rebirth is slated to release this winter, although an official release date has not yet been revealed. Considering it's Final Fantasy "7," many are speculating that Square Enix's daily QA will end on Day 7, which would be this Thursday, June 8. That's also the same day Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest presentation will air so perhaps we'll be seeing some footage of Rebirth during that, or at least maybe learning when we can play this game.
For more, check out Game Informer's June Summer Game Fest 2023 schedule, and then read our Final Fantasy VII Remake review to find out why you probably should play it before Rebirth. Check out our thoughts on Final Fantasy VII Remake's Episode Intermission DLC after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those in the UK, the latest “here’s what you could have won” bit of helpful EU regulation just dropped. Valve are now required to show Steam users in EU countries a game’s lowest price over the past 30 days, which means sellers can’t display deceptively high discounts by bumping the base price before a sale. Valve made the change in order to comply with the ominously named “Omnibus Directive”, which applies to all online stores.
Steam already enforces limits on manipulating prices around sales, but it’s nice that some people get to have a little extra peace of mind.

        <updated>2023-06-05T12:18:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft announced last month that it would be holding an Xbox Games Showcase this month, immediately followed by a Starfield Direct focused exclusively on Bethesda Game Studios' upcoming sci-fi RPG. According to the vice president of Xbox games marketing at Microsoft Aaron Greenberg, during the showcase, none of the company's first-party games will be "full CG trailers," as reported by GamesRadar. 
He goes on to explain this means every first-party trailer will be "either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematic" and each trailer will be labeled appropriately so it's clear what we're looking at. Greenberg tweeted this in response to someone poking fun at showcase tendencies to rely heavily on CGI trailers. 
None of our first party games in the show are full CG trailers. Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.
June 4, 2023
This all started with Greenberg quote-tweeting an Xbox tweet that highlights that the Xbox Games Showcase is live in seven days (well, six days now) on June 11. He quote-tweeted this Xbox tweet to reveal that the showcase is "roughly two hours of non stop games, games, games, games, and Starfield."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are 152 Shrines in Tears of the Kingdom, which means finding and solving them all is no small feat. Comparatively, Breath of the Wild had 120 (and you can see what finding all of those earned you here), but the reward is surprising, bizarre, and raises some interesting questions about the larger Zelda lore. It's worth noting that there are spoilers below for a late-game unlock.

Our Diablo 4 review called it "a beautiful, frictionless grey toybox that puts nothing in the way of you playing it for hours and wondering what you've done with your life." And just when the weather got nice. But quite a few of us have been playing advance copies, and I hope they've remembering to chug vitamin D pills like so many healing potions. Anyway!

That growth has enabled the sort of projects that might have been unheard of only a decade ago, with price points and complexity of play that can seem astounding to newcomers. Nonetheless, the dedicated audience for board games continues to clamor for ever higher-end projects with deep systems that enable truly epic adventures. That unique landscape paves the way for remarkable games like Aeon Trespass: Odyssey.

Not because it is unpleasant or incessant but rather because I so desperately want to hear it as I hunt for the last few Shrines in the game. But now, when I do hear it, the Shrine it is pointing to is so obscure that I spend hours trying to find the source of the noise.

Looking out into the distance, I see the occasional green door signaling a Shrine I have already discovered.

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, its soundtrack is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists. 
That’s why I was so excited to chat with composer Masayoshi Soken about his score for Final Fantasy XVI. You might recognize his name as he’s also the composer of Final Fantasy XIV. Still, if you don’t, there’s a chance it’s a name you come to remember following the release of FFXVI because after spending more than three hours of hands-on time with the game in Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While working on an automated opt-in survey (about which I write in a bit), it was noticed that our privacy policy and cookie policy is rather out-of-date. Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>
