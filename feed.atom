        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment's pint-sized survival game Grounded is making its way onto PlayStation and Switch on April 16. But it's not going to be the same game Xbox fans have enjoyed up until now. Grounded update 1.4, or the "Fully Yoked" update, adds even more content and a New Game+ mode.


Much of the content in the Grounded update 1.4 isn't for the new players, mind. The update is mostly geared toward those who have already either mastered the game's backyard or have gotten pretty close. It includes a lot of mid- to late-game content, and unlocking New Game+ requires defeating the backyard's most terrifying bosses. But it could be worth it, as New Game+ is more than just "Grounded but with recipes unlocked."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no mystery that the MORS is the best sniper rifle in Warzone, yet players discovered that the weapon is even stronger than originally imagined. 


CoD content creator Adiofreak posted a video proving that the MORS can shoot through any surface in Warzone with the Photonic Charge Barrel and Anti-Material ammunition equipped. In the clip, Adio downed an enemy, shooting through the bottom of the ground after live-pinging their location. The streamer also posted a second highlight to confirm his suspicion by getting a one-shot kill through a building. 


Try this while you can. Screenshot by Destructoid


"The MORS can literally shoot through anything in the game, including the ground," Adio claimed. "I have been getting spam reported since last week. It absolutely fries through vehicles as well, including the heavy chopper."


We expect this exploit to be patched very shortly, especially after the discovery has begun to make the rounds through Warzone discussions. But there is always the off-chance that the Anti-Material ammunition is working as intended, and the MORS will just continue dominating the battle royale. 


All stats already pointed to the MORS edging out the KATT-AMR and XRK Stalker for the best sniper rifle in Warzone. The MORS has a faster aim-down sight speed than the KATT-AMR and XRK Stalker, better bullet velocity, faster fire rate, movement speed, weapon swap speed, and reload time. If that wasn't enough the new Season 3 sniper rifle is capable of one-shot killing enemies from any range with the Anti-Material ammunition equipped. Having the ability to shoot through surfaces is the cherry on top for what's already a devastatingly powerful weapon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. 
Paramount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. 
Meanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new era of Pokémon Go is about to dawn with the upcoming release of the 'Rediscover' update. This update will not just tweak, but completely revamp the classic UI, transforming the visuals of battles, avatars, and the general screen. 


The Rediscover Go trailer unveils the long-running mobile game's new look, starting with refreshed avatar designs. The enhanced customization options now offer more defining details with shading, color, and a new background. Compared to the base game's appearance, it's a major upgrade, as Pokémon Go introduces a plethora of additional avatar and Style Shop designs. 




Although the new in-game map interface was only briefly shown, there are still some clear improvements. While The layout retains the game's roots, colors and area objects maintain more clearly defined edges and what appears to be enhanced textures. It also seems to load more background objects in the distance. 


Aside from visuals, Pokémon Go photographers can immerse themselves in Go Snapshot's upcoming features. One we know, in particular, is the option to take pictures with three Pokémon in a single photo. The new Pokémon Go updates are expected to arrive over the month, with the final launch in early May.


Pokémon Go Rediscover update release dates



New avatar customization - April 17 


New changes to Pokémon Go's visuals (in-game map/battles) - April 22


Rediscover Kanto region update - April 22


Go Snapshot update - May 7



The Kanto region update is the only one not explicitly discussed in the trailer or Pokémon Go page. Nevertheless, we know that creatures from this region will make "homes in certain biomes." This description could mean new creatures for your collection or a spotlight designated for Earth Day. Shiny Pokémon will likely be included to spawn more rare types, similar to most celebrations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard recently announced that sign ups for the beta to World of Warcraft: The War Within are now open, with the beta going live soon. Once it does, selected players will be able to test out the new expansion content before it officially releases this summer. 


The War Within is the MMO's next expansion, and the beginning of what they're calling "The Worldsoul Trilogy." Two more expansions, Midnight and The Last Titan, are planned to continue a larger overarching story. One of the new features of this expansion is a new playable Allied race, The Earthen Dwarves. These sturdy stone-folks will be available for both factions. 


You'll also be able to go on Delves to hunt additional loot. Each spec will have new Hero Talents to engage with. The incredibly popular Dragon Riding will be called Dynamic Flying and will be available with most flying mounts already in the game. There are also tons of new dungeons, zones, stories, quests, and more.


How to sign up for The War Within's beta





First, you'll need to sign up here at Blizzard's website. 


Once the beta goes live, selections will be made in waves. Blizzard even offers an explainer on its official FAQ to outline how it selects both alpha and beta testing access. To make sure you're ready for when you're selected, follow Blizzard's steps for installing the game below:



Update your graphic drivers and Battle.net desktop app


Select World of Warcraft from the Battle.net library


Install The War Within under the Play option


Click play and select a Test Server


Create a new test character or import a Dragonflight character

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon types are not just fierce; they are some of the most versatile and formidable creatures in Pokémon Go's battles. One prime example is Dragonite, a powerful ally that can be a game-changer for your team. So, whether you're embarking on a Raid or a PvP match, here is the best Dragonite moveset in Pokémon Go that can give you the edge you need. 


What moves are the best for Dragonite in Pokémon Go?


Dragonite's best movesets can change in Pokémon Go depending on the type of battle you are participating in. Understanding this is crucial, as it allows you to be prepared for any situation. To cover all bases, we've divided Dragonite's best moves into two categories: PvP and PvE. 


Best Dragonite PvP moveset in Pokémon Go


Dragonite's Dragon Breath and Superpower/Dragon Claw are strategic powerhouses in Pokémon Go's PvP battles. The Dragon Breath's speed and precision make it a formidable force, even if it doesn't pack the raw power of Dragon Tail. The ability still makes up for it with its fast timing, which will undoubtedly prove helpful in PvP. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


For a Charged Attack, use the move Superpower. It's balanced with timing and damage, hitting various Pokémon weaknesses as a Fighting Type move. If you're looking for something else, try Dragon Claw instead. It's another of those speedy strikes that could ultimately turn the odds in your favor.  


Best Dragonite PvE moveset in Pokémon Go


Given that timing isn't as crucial in Pokémon Go's PvE, Dragonite's best moveset for Raids/boss battles are Dragon Tail and Outrage/Draco Meteor. The powerful Dragon Tail is a reliable choice for a Fast Attack due to its high damage rates. But the brute force of Dragonite's Charged Attacks is where it truly shines. Whether you choose Outrage or Draco Meteor, both abilities unleash considerable damage, giving you the confidence to adapt to any Raid/boss battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's Chapter 5, Season 2 map has numerous locations to explore, from points of interest like Mount Olympus to minor landmarks like Coastal Columns. While some objectives require you to emote or eliminate enemies here, the Avatar Elements event asks you to visit these spots to unlock your Earth Chakra. 


Where is Mount Olympus and Coastal Columns in Fortnite?


Screenshot by Destructoid


The Mount Olympus POI is in the bottom-right corner of the Fortnite map, while Coastal Columns is a small landmark directly west of Pleasant Piazza. When you first play Fortnite, these locations will appear as grey fog on your map, requiring you to visit them to discover their exact locations. Otherwise, if you're an experienced player, you can glide down to the two locations shown in the map above to quickly knock out this quest.


Coastal Columns location


Coastal Columns is particularly tricky to spot, as its name doesn't appear on the map even after discovering it. The best way to find it is to travel west from Pleasant Piazza, past the building and road, until you see a second building. Upon visiting this building, you'll officially enter Coastal Columns and complete part of your Earth Chakra objective.


Mount Olympus location


Mount Olympus is slightly easier to find, as it is a named location that appears directly on your map once you discover it. You'll spot it directly north of Brawler's Battleground and southeast of Fencing Fields. You'll also spot an Olympian boss statue here where you can fight for an Aspect of the Gods. 


Once you visit both locations, you'll complete an Earth Chakra objective and get one step closer to unlocking the Appa Glider. Alongside this, you can also perform emotes or finish objectives for weekly missions, other events, and more as they appear.

You’ll then be able to interact with tougher and tougher terminals as you rank it up, which sometimes requires you to be at a certain level. They are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few things are more frustrating than gearing up for some crafting and survival with friends, only for one or more of you to run into connection issues. It can really put a damper on the weekend. For fellow Grounded players, here's how to fix the multiplayer when it isn't working.


Grounded, like most games, will have its share of issues and bugs. No, not the insect variety, though there are plenty of those in the game. Even the most popular of fixes may not be enough to get your game back on track. But we have compiled some suggestions and tips to get you back online.


Steps to fix Grounded multiplayer not working


First things first, make sure you've followed all the right steps to get the multiplayer in Grounded to work. It's a cross-platform game across console and PC via Steam and Game Pass. Players on Steam will need to follow an extra step to play with console and Game Pass friends. 


Image via Obsidian Entertainment


Steam players need to download the Xbox App and sign in with a Microsoft account. Once that's all setup, enter the app and link your Xbox and Steam accounts. Follow these steps to get connected:



Open the Xbox App and make sure you're signed in


Click on your user name at the top-left of the screen


Click on 'Settings' 


Scroll down to 'Linked accounts' and sign into your Steam account



With that out of the way, you should be able to view each other on your Xbox friends lists.

If you've already done the above, or if you aren't playing with Steam users, here are some other suggestions:



Restart your internet connection


Restart your platform (PC or console)


Check the Xbox network status


Check the game's status on X



If those options aren't working, there may be something more serious going on and you'll need help from an expert. Head on over to Obsidian Entertainment's support page and look up the issue or send a ticket to the support team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Divination, specifically tarot and oracle decks, has fascinated me most of my adult life. While I don't put much stock on the mystical abilities supposedly found in oracle decks, I've found the activity of drawing cards to speak on certain aspects of my life comforting and, occasionally, a useful guide.


The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is a game that takes that concept and makes it the core gameplay loop. Almost the entire runtime takes place in protagonist Fortuna's home as friends come and go, but often not before getting a reading. Despite having immortal witches who alter reality, a shrimp-like behemoth aiding the protagonist, and gathering energy from around the universe for a new deck, The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is surprisingly grounded during the actual process of card reading.

As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.
Available as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. 
The benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. 
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8]]></summary>

As you navigate the galaxy in Star Wars Outlaws, you do so as Kay Vess, a pickpocket-turned-thief who gets in over her head and winds up with a bounty on her head. Early in conversations, Lucasfilm Games and developer Massive Entertainment agreed that telling a scoundrel story was the way to go. Through these discussions, Massive decided it wanted to portray a "resourceful underdog" for its main character rather than the trained soldiers that star in The Division.
In the various meetings with Lucasfilm Games, Massive Entertainment looked at the various archetypes available to players…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While similarly named, Red Pills and Blue Pills in Type Soul have completely different functions. They also have different manners in which you find them. But regardless, you’ll find the information on how to get them and how to use them here.


How to get and use Red Pills


Red Pills are very straightforward, and also extremely useful. In short, they simply add 5 skill points to your character that you can then allocate. If you can get your hands on them, it’s a pretty sweet extra boost.


In terms of getting them, the most reliable way is spending Robux. However, Red Pills can rarely be seen available for purchases in the Karakura Town shop for 8000 Kan. You access this after a successful Karakura Raid. Just keep in mind that this is in no way guaranteed.


Like any item, you use the Red Pill by equipping it to a quick key, pressing it to bring it out, and then hitting the action button.


I’m going to mention this in the section ahead, but if you use a Blue Pill, it will eliminate stats gained from the Red Pill.


How to get and use Blue Pills


Blue Pills are how you reset your skills in Type Soul. If you need to completely start over from scratch and reallocate your points, a blue pill is what you need. One very important thing to note: This will eliminate all the skill points you earned from red pills, and it will also remove your skill boxes. Those are some pretty big caveats.


To get Blue Pills, you’ll need to run Karakura Raids. They have a very small chance to drop after successfully completing one. After completing a Karakura raid, occasionally, there will be one available in the town shop for 150,000 Kan. However, all this comes down to chance. Your best bet would be to get one from a provided code. While there isn’t a code currently that will gift you with a Blue Pill at the time of writing, you can keep an eye on our codes list for when one might come up.

Aspects of the Gods are boss medallions you claim by defeating Olympus God bosses at various landmarks during Fortnite's Chapter 5, Season 2 Myths and Mortals event. By beating a boss and its minions, it'll drop a medallion that, upon picking it up, will bestow upon you its respective power boost. Your Fortnite map indicates the exact location of each boss, depicted with a pillar icon in their respective POIs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bozjan Southern Front was introduced to Final Fantasy XIV  back in October 2020 with Patch 5.35. Since then, it and its follow up instance, Zadnor, have become a favorite, quick way to speed level alternative Jobs after level 71. Additionally, you'll need to enter the zone for any Resistance weapons you're hunting.


To unlock The Bozjan Southern Front, you’ll need to find your way to Gangos. Once there, you’re only a couple of steps away from diving into the huge 72-player instance, but getting there involves completing a long list of prerequisite quests. So, let’s start there.


Note: From this point forward, I will refer to The Bozjan Southern Front as ‘Bozja’ for the most part, as it is commonly referred to as this within the FFXIV community.

You might have seen some very bizarre screenshots of Hildibrand, the haphazard inspector that's the center of many well-liked side quests in Final Fantasy XIV (or even his low-poly counterpart Brandihild) leading the charge. I saw these too and, in true “believe everything you see on the internet” fashion, of course I had to try it out for myself. Did I manage? Yes. Was it easy? Not quite.

Best Soul Reaper build in Type Soul


In Type Soul, the best Soul Reaper build is Blood Soul Reaper.  With a crit-based weapon, Blood Soul Reaper has a high amount of damage and survivability which makes it the best Soul Reaper build in Type Soul at the moment. Theatre and Flower are both extremely powerful options as well, especially if the playstyle of either of those builds clicks with you better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over a year after One Piece Odyssey was originally released worldwide, Switch users are finally getting an opportunity to visit Memoria and relive some of the series' most iconic moments. 


Bandai Namco announced that One Piece Odyssey will be released on July 26 as a Deluxe Edition for Nintendo Switch. The Deluxe Edition includes two outfit sets and the Reunion of Memorias DLC, which tasks the Strawhat crew with escaping Memoria one final time. Also, The additional content pack adds stronger enemies and new ways to play through the base game.

One Piece Odyssey came out of nowhere in the best way possible. Over the past few years, most One Piece games have used the traditional battle combat found in the Pirate Warriors series, where you take on huge hordes of enemies with a sprinkling of exposition from the anime and manga. 


Bandai Namco went a different direction and used turn-based combat for Odyssey, and One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda supported the project by introducing new monsters, characters, and new original storyline that ties into the Strawhat journey we all know and love. Without giving too much away, the RPG challenges players with taking on a new sort of threat, while also going back in time to revisit memorable One Piece islands such as Water 7, Alabasta, Marineford, and more. 


Taking out waves of Marines never gets old in the Pirate Warriors series, but One Piece fans are in for a treat if they haven't experienced Odyssey yet. Bandai Namco did not reveal a price tag for the Deluxe Edition or any details on when players can start pre-ordering the title.

Marxist policy choices mean the faction are now protesting in my coal mines, shutting down a vital heat pipeline and fomenting further dissent among the now freezing broader populace. It is, regrettably, time to talk. They want me to pass the Apex Workers decree, a darwinian shift towards culling the weak while enhancing the strong. That’ll mean a tasty increase to production efficiency, so I’m not complaining - but the Technocrats will, so the vote won’t pass unless I can persuade the Machinists, their less extreme cousins, to support the bill. Not to worry: I promise the Machinists they can choose the next law we vote on, and watch a chunk of undecided voters shift towards implied eugenics.
The Frostpunk 2 beta has rammed home how different my role is to Frostpunk 1’s dictator. I’m more of a smooth talkin’, palm-greasin’ mayor tasked with keeping a dozen ideologically-opposed plates spinning above a city that could be one harsh blizzard from disaster. I like it, even though at times this jaunt to the a-popsicle-ypse can feel less like solving a crunchy puzzle and more like wading through politics soup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.

April 15, 2024
The most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.
The current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.
Previous Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. 
If you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.

        <updated>2024-04-15T15:54:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skill boxes in Type Soul are (typically) powerful moves that, um, come in a box. They are, without a doubt, the most important things to consider when building your character in the game, as some of them are so useful you might wind up building your character around them.


It might be no surprise that skill boxes are very hard to get, considering how useful they are. They are given as rewards for raids, and their drop rate is extraordinarily low. Faction Raids and Karakura raids both have a chance to provide you with one, so if you’re looking for a skill box, you can grind either one of those. However, if it’s not clear, it can take quite a while.


Once you have a skill box, the move you get from it is also random. If you’re looking for one in particular, it can take even longer before you get the one you want unless you’re extremely lucky. However, the skills do typically apply to your build, with them typically falling into the Skill Tree you have at least 25 points poured into.


Once you have a skill box, you use it by equipping it to one of your quick keys. You then press that key and your avatar will hold the box out. Press the use key, and the skill will drop into your skill tree. You won’t get any notification that it worked, which can be pretty jarring, but don’t worry, check the skill tree, and you’ll find it, usually at the bottom.


Lastly – and this is a bit of a bummer – you can only learn two box skills at once. If you’re really keen on getting a different pair, you can use a blue pill to wipe your skills back to the beginning and try again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crawl out through the fallout, baby! I've watched two episodes of Amazon's recently released Fallout TV show, a series for and about Walton Goggins' rizz (a thing the kids say). I've been on the Goggins hype train for over a decade at this point, and it's great that - oh sorry, I'm being told that the Fallout TV show is in fact about Bethesda's post-nukepocalypse RPG series of video games, and as such has given a massive player bump to said video games on Steam.
Posted on Xitter by SteamDB yesterday (HT to our pals at Eurogamer), it appears Fallout has more than doubled its concurrent players on Steam since the show dumped all its episodes last week.

And then we got an email about a game called Ants Took My Eyeball and I was like "Man, games need good names more often." I played the Steam demo for Ants Took My Eyeball (which is a 2D action roguelite where you go into an anthill to fight ants, who took your eyeball) and I very much liked the design, weapons and idea, but not the controls so much. Not my cup of tea, but have a go of the demo. But you know what got me to play an action platformer roguelite when those games aren't really my cup of tea? That godamn name is what!

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/15/lawbreakers-is-making-an-unofficial-comeback-thanks-to-fans"/>
        <updated>2024-04-15T14:16:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2017 low-gravity hero shooter LawBreakers is coming back from the dead. However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.
LawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. 
Now, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it's done by creating 'fake' servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”
RELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. 
Somehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!
https://t.co/1COV57FZQ5
April 13, 2024
The RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.
What did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

They exhibit a tweeness that you’ll either find charming or despicably manipulative, even when they’re showering in the blood of their enemies. Should you want to, though, Goblin Stone offers you the chance to rescue these maligned misfits from the brink of extinction, rebuilding their kingdom and leading them on outings to take the fight to all those heroes that have spotlight-hogged the left side of your screens for far too long.

Boasting some stylish pixel art visuals, Netherworld looks absolutely bonkers, and it's right up our alley. It also doesn't look like it's particularly suitable for younger players, so don't be fooled by the jaunty music in the trailer; there are definitely a few 'Conker' vibes with this one.

Reader Ebisumaru sent one in on the subject of Goemon back in February, and we're suckers for some inventive wordplay. We won't go over haiku structure/conventions here — you all know how to use Google — but feel free to send your submissions via the Letters form at the bottom of this page and we'll see what occurs!

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/faq/2024/04/13/what-is-the-difference-between-roguelike-and-rogue-lite"/>
        <updated>2024-04-13T20:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.
But the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.
“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. 
Rogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”
My hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.
“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”
To read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, Penitent one.

We caught wind of a rather pointless mod that allows Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to run in 4K (but with terrible performance). And more recently, we were treated to a new trailer for Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, showcasing a brand new form for its protagonist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet series rolls on with the latest expansion. This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. 
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. 
Check out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!

 Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, visit our hub by clicking the banner below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

It's just a walking simulator in which you explore a bunch of underground swimming pools. True, their size and layout defy explanation - what is this, a swimming pool for Slender Men? - but look, there are cute covered slides you can ride down in first-person. You know, like the ones you used to enjoy as a kid. Always that element of anxiety though about getting stuck halfway down, am I right?

2024 is turning out to be a pretty good year for Prince of Persia. We got the excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown in January, and then rumours of a new game from none other than Dead Cells devs Evil Empire proved to be true when The Rogue Prince of Persia was officially announced. And because of both of these things, it got us reminiscing about other entries in the long-running series.
Jordan Mechner's 1989 platformer built on the cinematic foundations of Karateka and started a franchise which has seen its share of ups (the Sands of Time reboot, the recent Lost Crown revival) and downs (the Sands of Time film, Prince of Persia 3D), but despite the occasional misfire or workaday entry, the series has endured for almost 35 years

It is, as it appears, an unabashed homage to Castlevania, but with none of the -vania, making it much more like the original (or the game boy ones, and possibly a few others in the series I don't know about): a straightforward, linear platform game about whipping monsters and not stepping on spikes. Ten a penny, right? But CNSBL captures it so well that it had me looking up old game boy tunes it vaguely reminded me of.

Super R-Type is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter launched in 1991, and it’s essentially an enhanced port of the arcade game R-Type II. It includes elements from that game while featuring new stages and enemies of its own.  
Wrecking Crew ‘98 is the Japan-only sequel to the NES classic Wrecking Crew. First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.
Amazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out. The game is a spin-off of the Hebereke series (known here as Uforia: The Saga, of which its long-awaited sequel recently launched).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Triple-i Initiative earlier this week, Gearbox Publishing and developer Wabisabi Games unveiled RKGK. Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.
RKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.


Valah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. 

RKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?). It’s coming to PC later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need anything from the shop? Mushroom milk? Fresh tarts? Mystical bejewelled skull? I'm just popping out to Dépanneur Nocturne, a lovely little game which came out in 2020 and I kept forgetting to post about. It's a small first-person explore-o-chatter set within a corner shop in a magical, mystical Montreal, full of things to admire, find, poke at, and chat about with the owner. And it'll only cost you about as much as a pint of semi-skimmed and loaf of Kingsmill from your own local shop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My most recent experiences with performance-testing strategy games have been defined by miserable sluggishness and dental drama, so it’s been a relief to find that citybuilding/RTS hybrid Manor Lords is set to launch in a relatively fine state. As an early access game, no less.
Having dug into the latest build’s GPU performance and graphics settings, I have found a few loose strands of technical flax that Manor Lords could do with snipping away. Yet it’s generally in good shape, both for early access and a solo developer project, successfully balancing strong visuals with relatively light hardware demands that should help it run on older PCs (or handhelds like the Steam Deck). Several hours in, the ugliest things I’ve seen are my road layouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to look up the plot of Bore Blasters, because my focus when playing the game is entirely on exploding dirt, but it turns out the Steam store page doesn't bother to explain any kind of plot either. Thus, the purity of Bore Blasters. Some facts can be divined from the earth, though: you play a dwarf, piloting a small ship akin to Robotnik's flying hedghog killer, and are dropped off on a small, discrete, gem-bearing chunk of dirt. This you pulverise, in a downward direction, with the aim of finding a huge chest of gems at the bottom somewhere. Your drill is the machine gun on your ship, your efforts governed by about two minutes worth of depleting fuel and a hull that can take three hits total. It's cyberpunk by Gimli.

Withering Rooms is one of the latter: released out of early access last week, and noticed by me just yesterday, it's a haunted mansion metroidvania in which you are a small girl in a nightie who must use meat cleavers, pentagrams and spells of self-enlargement or possession or incineration to overcome various monsters of the Silently Hilly and/or Residentially Evil persuasion. No, none of the monsters are Golden Retrievers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently revealed the newest big cover story from Game Informer – our blowout look at Massive Entertainment’s Star Wars Outlaws. We were excited by the chance to visit the studio in Sweden to play the game and interview the team. We were especially thrilled at the gorgeous art from the game that we shared on the cover, where we see protagonists Kay Vess and Nix firmly ensconced in the scum and villainy of that fictional galaxy far, far away.
To celebrate the new cover, we’re giving away five numbered copies of this issue’s Game Informer Gold Edition. If you’re not in the know, our Gold issues are numbered limited editions of each issue, featuring top-quality paper and ink, thicker cover stock, and a gold foil Game Informer logo. We produce an extremely limited number of copies of each issue, which are not available for sale. A sweepstakes like this is one of the only ways to snag a copy.
Even better, you’ve got many chances to win. Every individual who signs up for our new print subscription program is automatically entered for one chance to win. Already signed up at subscription.gameinformer.com? Then we’ve got good news! You’re already in the running for one of these gold editions.

The samurai epic, which tells a fictional story within a historical Japanese period of revolution, is one of the studio’s most ambitious titles from both game design and story perspectives. We got the opportunity to sit down with producer Yosuke Hayashi and director Fumihiko Yasuda to probe into how Rise of the Rōnin got made.
One aspect of the game that sets it apart from other Team Ninja titles is the monsters or demonic enemies that pervade its other games are nowhere to be seen in Rise of the Rōnin. Being set against a historical backdrop, Rōnin is limited just to human enemies of various fighting styles.

On Thursday, April 18, at 8 p.m. CEST/11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, the Czech studio will reveal whatever it has cooking on its YouTube and Twitch channels. This will be Warhorse’s second title; the studio debuted with the 2018 cult favorite medieval RPG Kingdom Come Deliverance.

It’s anyone’s guess what Warhorse has in store, but there’s a solid chance the new game is a Kingdom Come sequel. Despite receiving mixed reviews at launch, it has gained a passionate following, and it was ported to Switch last month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sketchy Fables is a hand-drawn, first-person adventure created by solo developer Alle Jong using 10,000 drawings. And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. 
As someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. 
Watch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


There's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, "Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure." Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. 
It's also "focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries," according to the page. 

As for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later.

Botany Manor asks players to perform those crucial first steps before challenging them to deduce the additional methods necessary to make their seedlings blossom. As I explored the beautiful grounds of a mysterious manor in search of answers, clever puzzle-solving and a serene atmosphere made these scientific exploits a …]]></summary>

That's partly because it's so easy to find a healthy one now, and there's a joy in shearing down multiple times and still finding material. You can start from "strategy games are in a good state" and go all the way down to "Turn-based strategy wargames that balance detailed simulation with accessibility and are set in World War 2" and still find several strong entries from the last few years.
But it's The Troop that grabbed me most. It's a little surprising, given its modest look, and the stiff competition. I think what clinched it is that The Troop has revealed to me something that I already sort of knew, but hadn't quite caught hold of: that a tank warfare game is all about the pause.

Picture it: the post-apocalyptic America of Fallout, radroaches and stimpacks and all, except that this being a TV adaptation, the first hour doesn't consist entirely of trying to persuade Bethesda's face editor not to make your character look like their soul has been sucked out. Instead, you can kick back with a can of Nuka Cola and watch flesh-and-blood stars Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten rove the wasteland. I caught the first couple of episodes last week, and while I find the show's aesthetics off-putting - it's kind of a Fallout themepark, rather than a convincing world - I do think there's the makings of a fun tale here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Never Alone, a quiet, snowy adventure set in the Alaskan arctic wilderness, won a Bafta in 2014, and at the Triple-I Initiative stream last night we got a glimpse of the upcoming sequel, Never Alone 2. It's still the tale of Nuna and Fox journeying through aforementioned cold tundra, and like the first game is inspired by Indigenous Iñupiaq storytelling traditions, but this time the story unfolds in co-op. No release date, but we have a teaser trailer for your viewing pleasure.

However, EA has denied Grubb's reporting, telling IGN, "We don't normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story." 
On Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, "They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me."
He continues, adding, "As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf."

Dubbed V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania, this DLC includes new cosmetics that allow you to take on the aesthetics of hair, clothing, and forms of Konami's Castlevania franchise, and it will give players the chance to fight Simon Belmont, too. 
As for what to expect, the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack will give players Alucard's Cloak, Alucard's Coat, Alucard's Leggings, Alucard's Gloves, and Alucard's Boots. "The complete set can be crafted in-game when you unlock the tailor bench," the DLC's Steam description reads. "It costs cloth and coarse thread to make and is purely cosmetic. Using the new armor customization feature, you can don the garb of the Vampire Prince at any level of your vampire journey." 
Check out the V Rising: Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack DLC trailer for yourself below: 


We learned last month that V Rising is coming to PS5 later this year, and according to the trailer above, the Legacy of Castlevania DLC will be available on the platform when the base game launches on it.

Pocketpair briefly pulled back the curtains on Palworld Arena during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, which is where we saw some of the gameplay from the arena in action. 
If the trailer is any indication, it appears to support splitscreen co-op and gives players the chance to fight head-to-head in an arena to see whose party of Pals is the strongest. 
Check it out for yourself in the Palworld Arena trailer below: 


"The Pal Arena makes its way to Palworld in 2024," the trailer's description reads. "Battle against other players, pitting both yourself and your pals against them. Train the strongest Pals and defeat all your rivals." 
That's all we know about the Palworld Arena, but since it's arriving this year, we might not have to wait too much longer to learn more. 
In the meantime, catch up on all things Palworld with Game Informer's Palworld primer, and then read about the latest update, which added the first Raid boss to the game alongside additional Pal and base changes, and more.

If you were intrigued by it back then, I have good news. The Triple-i Initiative gave us more of a glimpse at how the game would look in the hands, with precious UI markers and the promise we'll uncover new "Torture Chambers". Lovely. No seriously, it does look quite lovely, if a touch predictable.

When I had the chance to go hands-on with The Rogue: Prince of Persia, I had only watched the credits roll on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a few nights ago. Before that, the last time I watched credits roll on a new Prince of Persia game was in 2010 with The Forgotten Sands. I was surprised and happy to play a new excellent Prince of Persia game this year, but considering how long I had to wait for that one, I was not holding my breath for another – not even the Sands of Time remake I have been patiently waiting for.
Which is to say it was incredibly surprising when Ubisoft reached out about its new Prince of Persia rogue-lite. It’s not a mode in Lost Crown or a spinoff, as I initiall…]]></summary>

Called The Rogue Prince Of Persia, a name choice that makes it sound a bit like an illegal knockoff being sold out of the back of Evil Empire's Peugeot, I got to have a go of about 45 minutes of it last week. It's 2D, side on platforming, and super colourful. Think Dead Cells skinned as a kids cartoon with a branded cereal tie-in, extremely cool music, and an emphasis on wall running. It's mobile even by the standards of a platformer, in fact, and is entering Steam early access on May the 14th.

The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown released in January, and today we learn about The Rogue: Prince of Persia, which will be entering early access in May.
The game comes from developer Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, and the lineage shows. The game is a 2D platformer roguelike that has a lot in common with Dead Cells, but after spending some hands-on time with the game, it also has its own identity. Join Marcus Stewart and me as I share details about my hands-on experience with the next Prince of Persia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Publishing have released a new trailer for Mouse, the 1930s vintage cartoon-inspired FPS, and in it, we get gameplay featuring new traversal mechanics, power-ups, and more. Released during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, this new Mouse gameplay trailer highlights the grappling hook, helicopter, and Spinach power-up. 
As you might expect, the grappling hook allows players to target designated points in a level for rapid movement and traversal. The helicopter adds vertical traversal to players' arsenal with reduced descent speed, and finally, the Spinach power-up augments and enhances melee combat (in a nod to Popeye). 
Check out the latest Mouse gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


"Mouse is incredibly important to all of us here at Fumi Games, and we're committed to making sure that it lives up to all of the expectations," Fumi Games CEO Mateusz Michalak writes in a press release. "Our goal has always been to create a game that combines our passion for animation with our passion for first-person shooters. We are genuinely committed to collaborating closely with the Mouse community to craft a game that truly resonates with players. 
"We'll aim to share more details – whenever possible – as development progresses. Our partnership with PlaySide and our dedicated and talented team is working hard to bring you the finest grandboomer cartoon shooter ever created." 
Here are some new screenshots from Mouse for your viewing: 

Mouse was revealed back in 2023; it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Poncle has revealed that Vampire Survivors will finally hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 this summer. Before that, though, Vampire Survivors will cross over with Contra in Operation Guns, a new DLC featuring characters, weapons, and more from the series, on May 9. 
This was revealed during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase with a new trailer highlighting what Contra in Vampire Survivors looks like, and perhaps to nobody's surprise, it looks awesome. This trailer also reveals that PlayStation players can play Vampire Survivors this summer. The game is already available on Xbox, Switch, PC, and mobile devices. 
Check out the Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns and PlayStation reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Operation Guns looks like an exciting boost of weaponry, characters, enemies, and more to Vampire Survivors. And it's right around the corner, too, hitting the game on Xbox, PC, and Switch on May 9. It will presumably be available from the jump when Vampire Survivors hits PlayStation platforms later this summer. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Vampire Survivors review.

        <updated>2024-04-10T17:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlaySide Studios has revealed Kill Knight, a new Hades-inspired isometric arcade shooter coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year. Revealed with a gameplay trailer during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, Kill Knight plunges players into an Eldritch abyss of horrors where waves of enemies stand in the way of their one goal: kill the last angel. 
"Once a loyal knight, betrayed, and banished to the Abyss," a press release for Kill Knight reads. "A desecrated corpse inside reanimated armor. You rise to an eternal death. Branded Kill Knight, you have one purpose – kill the last angel. Players must learn to exploit enemy weaknesses, enact brutal executions, and weave through the Knight's Arsenal to tactically manage resources as they dance with death in the Abyss and take the fight to global leaderboards against friends and foes alike." 
Check out the Kill Knight reveal trailer for yourself below: 


In Kill Knight, players are challenged to master the demon within as they descend through the voids of an eldritch arena and harness a devastating arsenal of armor and weapons against swarms of otherworldly horrors. As you can see in the trailer above, Kill Knight features fast and visceral top-down arcade-action combat with a disgustingly horrific otherworld to traverse through. There are five fatal layers to get through, each more deadly than the last, according to PlaySide Studios. 
As you survive waves of enemies, your Kill Power will increase, which in turn increases your speed and damage. Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight's Arsenal "and evolve your playstyle." In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too. 
Here are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing:

The meditative mountain environments are the sort of tranquil backdrop I’d happily stare out for hours, possibly with a Bonobo album and some incense, which is helpful, because the actual game is aiming to be quite a challenge.
According to its Steam page, the game “tasks you with creating a new home for your people forced out of the lowlands.” There are both campaign and sandbox modes, where you’ll establish multiple towns on multiple mountains, each with its own traits. “All your towns co-exist in symbiosis,” it continues, “creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements.” Here are some more deets, via Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been a lot of remakes that take provocative creative liberties with the original game of late. I've always felt like last year's Darkest Dungeon 2 was secretly one of them. Rather than simply building on the previous game's premise of a Hamlet's worth of upgradeable, derangeable heroes venturing into tabletop RPG-style labyrinths, it stripped away Darkest Dungeon's skin and moved its bones and organs around to create a gruelling roguelike. Well, developers Red Hook appear to have done it again with Darkest Dungeon 2's free Kingdoms mode, out later this year, which slices open Darkest Dungeon 2's hide and recomposes it into a turn-based strategy boardgame, where you defend a world map against encroaching eldritch creatures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Danish developer Northplay and publisher Ghost Ship Publishing have revealed Dinolords, a medieval real-time strategy game where you fight Vikings and defend your lands alongside dinosaurs and more. In a new teaser trailer published during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, we get glimpses of dino-powered armies, action RPG combat mixed with real-time strategy, and more. 
"We're honored to be showcasing our brand new trailer thanks to the Triple-i Initiative amongst so many incredible games and developers that make up the amazing indie corner of the games industry," Northplay CEO Michael Flarup writes in a press release. "We've poured a lot of love into Dinolords and we can't wait for players to get their hands on it when it launches into Early Access next year." 
Check out the new Dinolords reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Northplay says while mixing real-time strategy with action RPG gameplay, players will also have to gather resources, build cities, construct fortifications, and command units in widescale medieval warfare. 
Dinolords takes place in an alternate history in which the King of Denmark launches the first dinosaur-powered conflict with his invasion of England, according to a press release. Players take on the role of an English Lord, defending their land against the ferocious invaders and taming their own primeval beasts for battle.

Attention, dear Hobbits! Mark your calendars for our #TalesoftheShire trailer on April 22! pic.twitter.com/aZXvmR8qUs
April 10, 2024
As for what to expect, Wētā Workshop has shared little about the game beyond its initial reveal teaser. We know the game promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit lives, and that sounds great on its own, but we're excited to see what that entails from a gameplay perspective. If I had to guess, Tales of the Shire will fall somewhere between a life sim and a farming sim, akin to something like Animal Crossing but with Hobbits. 
Fortunately, we don't have to wait too long to find out because the first trailer for Tales of the Shire arrives on Monday, April 22.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s the birthday of the Triple-I Initiative, a 45-minute showcase of game announcements and trailers from the likes of Slay The Spire devs MegaCrit, Darkest Dungeon devs Red Hook and Dead Cells custodians Evil Empire. What makes a “triple-I” game a “triple-I” game, as opposed to (hawk, spit) a regular indie? I've given it some thought, and I think the answer is: "has more money and status than most indies, but not, like, Call of Duty levels, and also one of our partners is Gearbox Publishing, so this is perhaps ‘indie’ in the Geoff Keighley sense."
Don’t expect any of Keighley's beloved Kojima interludes or dance numbers in this one, however. The IIIIs are a leaner, quieter showcase with no host or advertising or celebrity drop-ins – you can read more about the thinking behind the event in my GDC interview with a few of the participating studios. Find the full stream below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s acclaimed Dave the Diver is coming to PlayStation next week on April 16. The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.
Dave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version's DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to "sense the movements of the deep sea." The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. 


Dave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.
As editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, "You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it's the very fact that you don't usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying."
Dave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has released a new gameplay trailer for the Adventure Mode in the upcoming Switch-exclusive Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. In it, we get gameplay of the up-to-four-player mode that features 200 stages set across various different worlds, and it looks like a blast. 
Featuring both local and online four-player co-op, Adventure Mode will be available on day one when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble launches on Switch on June 25. Optional assist features, like Rewind and Ghost Guide, allow players to customize how their monkey ball experience plays. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble: Adventure gameplay trailer below: 


"While visiting a tropical island, AiAi and the gang meet a girl named Palette, an adventurer searching for the Legendary Banana," a press release reads. "They agree to join her on her journey across wondrous worlds to collect special parts said to be the key to localizing this prized relic. Along the way, they'll meet new friends and encounter mysterious rivals."
Adventure Mode features 200 new stages set across different worlds, such as Banana Farm, Rose Garden, Floating City, Golden Temple, and Stone Valley. Each brings its own unique twist and challenge to the Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble experience. 
In Adventure Mode, players can utilize the Rewind feature to rewind to a previous point of a stage and re-attempt a particularly challenging section. The Ghost Guide option adds a transparent monkey alongside the player that demonstrates how to proceed, while the Route Guide will point you in the right direction if you're unsure of where to go. Plus, you can restart at any checkpoint within a stage at any time. 
Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble hits Switch on June 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drop Bear Bytes, the studio behind post-apocalyptic RPG Broken Roads, are named after Australia’s deadliest creature. The Drop Bear might look like a normal koala, but they’re actually dangerous predators, fond of jumping from trees to maul unsuspecting chumps who forget to take adequate precautions, like urinating on themselves. Really, the story is a wind-up the aussies like to blag tourists with. If it looks like a koala, it’s just a koala. But it’s this sort of character, inspired by love for Australia’s unique landscape, culture and good-natured mick-taking, that forms the heart of the best bits in Broken Roads. I say ‘best bits’, but I should probably say ‘the only bits that I actually enjoyed’, unfortunately.
Bombs wiped out 80% of Australia’s population, and left the remaining nail-hard Nancys and tough Tobiases to fend for themselves in a world short of resources, but shockingly plentiful in both guns and pre-made Vegemite sarnies. You’ll pick one of four character classes - I went with ‘Jackaroo’ (cattle hand), because it was called ‘Jackaroo’ - before tackling a short tutorial section. You'll then be thrust into some events, where you’ll meet the rest of your starting party and kick off the game proper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I went to a screening of Amazon and Bethesda's Fallout TV show, a spin-off yarn starring Ella Purnell (who voiced Jinx in the Arcane Netflix adaptation) as a recently surfaced Vault Dweller, scouring the irradiated wastelands for [SPOILERS REDACTED]. It's early days, but the show's first two episodes didn't make a massive impression on me, though I will concede that the sight of Amazon's branding on Fallout's infamous Please Stand By emergency broadcast titlecard makes a dangerous amount of sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not a Fallout fan. I’ve always admired the games and dabbled with them for a few hours here and there, but it was never a series that inspired excitement in me. I am, however, a fan of the Fallout series executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. The two worked together on Westworld and though my fandom faded over time, I will always hold up the first season as some of my favorite television ever. I went into Amazon’s Fallout adaptation with unsure expectations. Video game movies and TV shows have improved in recent years, but I will always be hesitant. And time has frequently proven that one successful project from a creator (or a pair in this case) does not automatically equal success in another. Thankfully, however, the Fallout show is scary, violent, funny, weird, intriguing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks two years since the official reveal of Kingdom Hearts IV, and while Square Enix hasn't shared any news about the game, fans of the series can celebrate with a new recording of the franchise's best song by Hikaru Utada. As pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN, Utada's new Science Fiction album, which they released yesterday, features a re-recording of "Hikari," the Japanese version of "Simple and Clean." 
If you're a Kingdom Hearts fan, you likely already know which song this is. However, if you haven't touched the series in a while, or if you've never played the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, it's the Japanese version of the song in this famous game opener below: 


As for the new recording of "Hikari," its place on Science Fiction makes sense because its Utada's first greatest hits album, if you will, meant to act as a compilation with new mixes of old songs, re-recordings of fan-favorite tracks, and more. You can listen to the album, which features 26 tracks, starting today. 
If you're interested in hearing the new recording of "Hikari," you can listen below:

Created by EA Dice, overseen now by Respawn CEO Vince Zampella, recently worked on by EA's founded-and-shuttered Ridgeline Studios, and now EA Motive are the latest to be stuck with the beleaguered milsim.

In an update announcing that seasonal updates for Battlefield 2042 were drawing to an end, EA say that Motive Studio - best known for the Dead Space remake - are "building a team focused on Battlefield at their studio."

If you haven't had the pleasure, Kay is a budding crook on the run from her underworld boss, a journey that sees her tangling with several other Star Wars crime syndicates on various planets. It really feels like they're keeping a lot of the headline Star Wars stuff at a respectful distance for this one: yes, Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, but there's nary a whiff of The Force, Jedi or Sith in the trailer and not once does anybody build a Death Star.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motive Studio, the EA team behind last year's Dead Space remake and its in-development Iron Man game, has revealed it is forming a new internal team to support the Battlefield franchise. Motive will help develop future Battlefield experiences as it continues to work on its Iron Man game with Marvel, which it says has hit a "major internal milestone." 
This news comes from a new blog post by Motive's general manager, Patrick Klaus, where he also reveals the directors behind the studio's Dead Space remake – executive producer Philippe Ducharme and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola – will build a new team to work alongside EA's Battlefield studios. 


"Their proven expertise in storytelling, immersive battles, and developing on the Frostbite engine uniquely positions them to help advance the vision for Battlefield, led by Vince Zampella (EVP, group general manager for Respawn and Battlefield) and Byron Beede (SVP, general manager for Battlefield). 
"In parallel, development continues to move forward on our Iron Man project, led by Olivier Proulx (executive producer) and Ian Frazier (creative director). The team made excellent progress this year, hitting a major internal milestone and laying a robust foundation for the journey ahead. Iron Man is an important priority for Motive, and I'm very proud of the work we've accomplished so far." 
Motive will work with other EA studios like Criterion, DICE, and Ripple Effect to further expand the company's Battlefield franchise, which saw its last entry, Battlefield 2042, released in 2021. In 2022, we learned the next Battlefield game had entered pre-production with plans to take "valuable lessons" learned from Battlefield 2042 into the game's development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many ways Children Of The Sun is a highly relatable game. I do not have telekinetic powers that allow me to control the path of a bullet from a sniper rifle, and I was not part of a murderous cult that killed my father-figure. But if I did and I were, you can bet that I'd go on a rip-roaring rampage of revenge! Stepping into the be-grimed trainers and unwashed jacket of the protagonist - a misused girl whose vibe is that of a member of Gorillaz - you shoot a single bullet from your gun and control it in first-person as you zip it through the heads, hearts and hands of cultists placed around a level. It's a satisfying Sniper Elite meets Superhot puzzle of ultraviolence, and it's neat.

The team behind Witchfire, The Astronauts, says today's update is the "first major" patch for the game, which is why it contains so much additional content. 
Alongside new classes, enemies, weapons, and spells, the Ghost Galleon update also includes new events to take part in, a shop vendor offering novel items, and more features for players to explore. This update, like the game itself, is available right now on PC on the Epic Games Store. 
To go with today's news, The Astronauts have released a new Witchfire trailer showcasing what you can expect:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Creative Assembly have released the first proper trailer for Total War: Warhammer 3's forthcoming Thrones of Decay expansion, which pits the human Empire, Chaos Nurgle faction and industrious Dwarfs against each other in what the press release terms "a showdown of mohawks, maggots and machines". Alliteration, is it? Well, two can play at that (strategy) game: the new expansion explodes upon the extensive environments of this elaborate ex-tabletop experience with an eccentric... ensemble of new legendary lords, battle units and campaign features, plus various free bits for owners of the base game.


9-3 to me, Creative Assembly! Find the Thrones of Decay trailer below - sorry, I just need a few minutes to massage my temples.

Now the sequel, Sucker For Love: Date To Die For has revealed a release date of April 23rd, and seems to be leaning into horror even more, while also still being a dating sim featuring an eldritch goat god with massive cans. Yet the presser also says "no scares this time". I am confused, which is why it's probably good there's a demo on Steam to sort of give you a taster.

        <updated>2024-04-09T13:22:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ermac is the next fighter to join the Mortal Kombat 1 roster, and developer NetherRealm Studios has released a new gameplay trailer showcasing what players can expect of the shadowy warrior. The trailer also reveals Ermac hits Early Access on April 16 before his full release on April 23, and that Mavado will join the Kameo roster later next month. 
"Ermac is a collection of souls bound together by Quan Chi's dark magic that are intended to function as a group mind," a press release reads. "But that spell is temporarily undone when Ermac is defeated by Mileena and the mind of King Jerrod, deceased ruler of Outworld and one of the souls in Ermac's collection, takes control and rejoins the royal family, aiding Empress Mileena's reign. 
"Eventually, the amalgam of souls re-establishes control, and Ermac retreats to Outworld's shadows. No longer Quan Chi's slave, nor bound to the royal family, he must find a future worth fighting for."
Check out Ermac in the Mortal Kombat 1 gameplay trailer below: 


To get Ermac, purchase the Premium Edition of Mortal Kombat 1 or buy the Kombat Pack for your Standard Edition of the game. The Kombat Pack indudes a Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now) and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (coming April 16), Homelander, and Takeda Takahashi. The Kombat Pack includes all five DLC Kameo fighters, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review.

        <updated>2024-04-09T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March 2023, Dredge became one of the most talked-about games of the year thanks to its combination of engaging fishing mechanics, an enthralling atmosphere, and a fun story involving sinister secrets buried at sea. Ahead of the BAFTA Awards on Thursday, at which Dredge is nominated for four awards, developer Black Salt Games has announced a collaboration with production company Story Kitchen to adapt the critically acclaimed title into a live-action feature film.
In the game, players explore a mysterious archipelago as a fishing boat captain. However, the longer you play, the more unsettling the water surrounding the collection of remote islands becomes. The press release pitches the Dredge live-action film, saying, "Think The Sixth Sense on the water. A grounded atmospheric cosmic horror blend of HP Lovecraft and Ernest Hemingway."
"We are excited to partner with such an experienced studio team to bring the world we created to live action and ignite the imagination of audiences across the globe," a joint statement from the Black Salt Games team said in that same press release.
Story Kitchen was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 producer Dmitri M. Johnson, former APA Agent Mike Goldberg, and their production and development executives Timothy I. Stevenson and Dan Jevons. "Dredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning," a joint statement from Story Kitchen said in the press release.
Dredge currently has an 80 out of 100 rating on the reviews aggregate website Metacritic. If you missed it, it is currently available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Yesterday, players celebrated what they thought was the complete eradication of the Automaton Legion in Helldivers 2. The official Helldivers 2 X (formerly Twitter) account even tweeted about players' success in the galaxy. Now, roughly a day later, the Automatons have returned. 
"Somehow, the Automatons returned. As suspected all along, the previous Bot force was merely a vanguard. A massive fleet how now begun an assault on Cyberstan and the surrounding planets. Helldivers, hold back this unprovoked invasion. The fight continues!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios' Fallout TV series will premiere one day early, with all eight episodes now hitting Prime Video on April 10 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The series was originally due out on April 12 but Amazon announced it had moved the launch day up to April 11 alongside a new look at the show. Now, Amazon has moved the date up one more day, meaning you can check out this live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic wasteland tomorrow. 
Walton Goggins, who plays The Ghoul, announced this news during a new Fallout commercial that aired last night (April 8) during the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game. After the first episode airs at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET tomorrow, the other seven episodes will be available for viewing exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. 
If you haven't yet seen it, check out the latest Fallout trailer for a new look at the show: 


"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have," a press release reads. "Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them." 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Prime Video on April 10. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer's reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buckshot Roulette is simple, and simply unsettling. Sat across the table from a mysterious opponent clad in a deeply unnerving toothy mask, you pick up a shotgun loaded with shells. Then, you decide whether to point the gun at your opponent or yourself, and pull the trigger. Some of the shells are live, and others are blanks. Guess correctly, and you get to go again.

News of Sam Fisher’s return first snuck out at the end of 2021, with little more spotlight than a brief blog post to confirm that, yep, it’s a thing. After over two years of near-silence, it now looks like it might finally be time for Sam to emerge out of the shadows.

Here's how that works, direct from the bellowing bearded faces of the developers themselves. By which I mean, a new Steam blog. I'm not sure it's possible to get a good dwarven bellow going when you're talking about cosmetic unlock progression, but by all means reorganise this article into some kind of drinking song. Keep it clean, though - there may be elves reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The deck-fixing roguelikelike poker of Balatro is chuffing excellent, no doubt, but my main criticism has been that the higher difficulty modes are just a bit boring. Having beat them myself, I didn't find them a fun or interesting challenge as much as an annoying one that required too much to go right. I'm glad to hear that they're being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.

        <updated>2024-04-08T16:03:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was "Elder Scrolls with friends," creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch "we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game'," Lambert says. "We didn't do either of them particularly well."
Ten years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating "a lot of feedback", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. "We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since." Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Botany Manor is a game that seems calculated to make me sit up on alert like a meerkat, or crash through a wall yelling like that sentient jug mascot (I am not from America, I just know he exists). It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.

An aquarist is someone who builds and manages aquariums, which is your principle task in the capital A Aquarist game. It recently left early access, which is sort of unbelievable because it's very janky in the most adorable way. You can tell it was made by someone who bloody loves aquariums, but taken at face value the career mode tells a strange tale indeed. For example, you have a very unsettling father.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, "overambitious" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.
The carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.

The air is foul with it. This week is the week of the inaugural Triple-I Initiative showcase, aka the IIIIs, aka a 45-minute dollop of trailers and announcements from such studios as Slay The Spire creators MegaCrit and Darkest Dungeon developers Red Hook. We know of a couple of the announcements in advance; others, we'll learn about alongside you on 10th April.

Since their partnership began in 2005, Japan-based CODA and the MPA have collaborated on thousands of cases. An agreement governing their work together just celebrated its 10th anniversary and, in a ceremony last week, a two-year extension was officially acknowledged. With piracy surging, the renewal comes at just the right time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.]]></summary>
