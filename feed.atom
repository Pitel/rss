        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Assassin’s Creed series debuted in 2007, and since then, the series has become a fixture in the gaming landscape. It received reliable annual installments (or more!) for several years; that cadence has relented a bit now, but the franchise's long history has certainly left us with no shortage of Assassin’s Creed games to enjoy. But how do they stack up against each other?
 We originally published a version of this list back in 2015, but more Assassin's Creed games have released now, and some of our perspectives have shifted. So we are taking another look at the titles in the whole main series (no spin-offs or side-stories) and ranking them, highlighting the best moments and acknowledging the weaknesses in each.

        <updated>2023-12-21T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's just a couple of winners left to announce as Destructoid's GOTY awards wrap up for the year, and that includes our staff pick for the Best PC Game of 2023.


This year offered a healthy spread of genres, and studios big and small wound up making our cut. Some of our favorite indies that didn't wind up competing for that genre's award wound up here, as Slay the Princess, Cocoon, and BattleBit Remastered compete for a spot among PC greats.


Starfield is competing here too  — there's no reality in which I'm playing that on consoles without mods, and it seems a lot of us are in the same boat. There's also Baldur's Gate 3, Dave the Diver, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on our nominees list, but Larian's brain tadpoles ultimately win here. 





That is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is Destructoid's Best PC Game of 2023. It's one of the games that, even in a year of heavy hitters, stands out as a must-play. 


Our review, handled by senior editor Eric Van Allen, echoes many of my own sentiments about the RPG as he praises its storytelling, visual scale, and strategic combat. I've spent more than my fair share of time troubleshooting it, especially into Act 3. But that I can still enjoy it this much this speaks to the quality of both what's already there and the continued update support from Larian. Even at its ugliest, Baldur's Gate 3 is a gem. 


I'm stuck in a constant loop replaying BG3, so it'll probably wind up my pick for 2024, 2025, and so on. The romances are just too good, and when I'm not poking around in Faerun, I'm busy modding it. Either way, thanks to the folks at Larian for pulling this together. It's a special game with a development tale I'm endlessly curious about, and I'm not sure if I'll ever play another like it.



Destructoid’s Best PC Games of 2023, nominees:



Baldur’s Gate 3


Starfield


Cocoon


Slay the Princess


Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty


BattleBit Remastered


Dave the Diver

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arion Kurtaj, an 18-year-old hacker behind the massive GTA 6 leak last year, has been given an indefinite hospital order.


Kurtaj is a member of the international gang Lapsus$, which was behind various high-profile cybersecurity attacks over the past year. It is estimated that attacks on Uber, Nvidia, and Rockstar have cost the companies up to $10 million. Per the BBC, Kurtaj expressed apparent unwillingness to stop conducting similar attacks. 


It turns out that by the time he committed the GTA 6 hack, Kurtaj was already on bail for hacking Nvidia and BT/EE. The BBC reports: "Despite having his laptop confiscated, Kurtaj managed to breach Rockstar, the company behind GTA, using an Amazon Firestick, his hotel TV and a mobile phone."


Kurtaj and another unnamed member of the Lapsus$ hacking group are the first to be convicted, while others are thought to remain at large, according to the BBC.


In July, Arion Kurtaj was deemed unfit to stand trial following a diagnosis of acute austism. The court then had the jury focusing not on whether Kurtaj had done it with criminal intent, but solely on whether or not he had perpetrated the alleged crimes at all.


Regarding the mediate fate of Kurtaj, BBC reports: "He will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger."


The news arrives just a few days after news broke of a massive hack at Insomniac, leaking details about in-development games and information about the studio.

Pokémon stories suck. For a world with so much creativity packed into it, Game Freak regularly fails to include a provocative narrative to go along with its colorful monsters. No one – including myself – expects a Pokémon game to win a Nebula Award for Best Game Writing, but that doesn’t exempt them from producing something halfway intriguing, even if the series remains aimed at children. Fun characters, like smokeshow Professor Kukui from Pokémon Sun and Moon or fan-favorite goth girl Marnie from Pokémon Sword and Shield, certainly bring some life to each game, but for about a decade now the Pokémon tales have either been incredibly rushed or downright insulting to both children and adult fans alike.

For me, it's usually when I pick up titles I didn't have a chance to play throughout the year but definitely wanted to at some point. After all, not often is there a better discount than what we see with the Steam Winter Sale, at least anytime soon.




Some great deals


With so many titles on sale at once, usually, you can find games of every genre heavily discounted. This includes new releases and even those that have been out for some time. Here's a handful of great deals I've found while briefly looking over the sale:



Civilization VI — $5.99 (90% off)


Stellaris — $11.99 (70% off)


Total War: Warhammer III— $29.99 (50% off)

Despite having some of the best sneaking action and gunplay, the open world and “missions” structure didn’t necessarily speak to fans of the more linear, tightly scripted feel of the previous games.

It was always fun to tear through the grubby guts of a Gothic industrial megacity with your chainsword, but it became repetitive and its whole loot-o-crafting mess sucked. A year on, the loot and crafting still suck, but I've really enjoyed the variety added by new levels and weapons and the polish from a year of tweaks and quality-of-life changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know that D4 Enterprise is releasing Japanese PC-88 games on Switch? It hasn’t been going on for long, but I just learned it now, thanks to Hydlide. D4 has added two titles to their EggConsole lineup, with 1984’s Hydlide and 1986’s Silpheed.


The PC-88 is a Japanese home computer, similar to the Commodore 64 or Apple II. While we never got it over here in the West, it was extremely popular in its home country. Because of this, there are very few ways for Anglophones to really experience them. The fact that someone is porting games from the platform to Switch is pretty exciting to retro explorers such as myself.


Hydlide is an interesting, but kind of dopey, game that was ported to the NES but originally released on the PC8801. It’s an action RPG that predates both Dragon Quest and The Legend of Zelda. It’s a pioneer! Though, it’s also not a great one. Still worth experiencing for the historical context and its overall importance in the genre. It's the same reason you might play the original Ultima.

Silpheed, on the other hand, is a scrolling shoot-‘em-up. For 1986, it feels so ahead of its time. It uses a lot of 3D effects and has some pretty rocking music. It was ported to other microcomputers at the time, got a semi-sequel on the Sega CD, and lived on through entries on the PS2 and Xbox 360.


Beyond these two games, you can also find Xanadu, Relics, and Thexder already available as part of the EggConsole series. Each one runs for $6.49, which strikes me as a good price. The only thing to note is that parts of these games are still in Japanese, but it appears that all of the important stuff is in English.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was a perfect crescendoed sonata of how to wow an audience. At first, I was just impressed with how magnificent and sprawling the sky islands were. By the time I had brute-forced puzzles with unique object manipulation mechanics and discovered the depths of the underground, I was completely enamored.


Breath of the Wild managed to sing a similar song back in 2017, but this felt considerably different. That's worth talking about because at first, some were worried that Tears of the Kingdom would crib way too much from Breath of the Wild. I'll admit, I was even curious to see just what Nintendo had in store for us here; not just from a freshness standpoint, but in terms of the greater reaction from fans.

Ultrakill is set in a post-apocalypse where human blood is the only currency that matters anymore, as it fuels the few robots that remain. Given this premise, it's to be expected that the game's narrative and level design would take some weird turns, but the seventh layer of Hell is particularly noteworthy. Featuring remarkably agile, powerful, and aggressive angelic statues as the first encounter of the new Act, Ultrakill's Patch 14 is a sight to behold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've never played Geometry Dash, you may find you're missing out on one of the most engaging games in the rhythm genre. Now, after several years, not only has a new version been released, but it's caused the concurrent player count to spike to an all-time high.


According to recent data from SteamDB, Geometry Dash reached a peak of 88,346 on December 20. If you look at the graph, you can see how it shot up in the space of a couple of hours, with the previous count showing just under 13,000 players.




Progress on update 2.2 has been a long time coming. In fact, the last update from developer RobTop Games was in October, which said that the proposed November release would "not be doable." Now that it's finally out, we can see just how much people have been waiting for it.


Bouncy bouncy


For those who haven't experienced it, Geometry Dash has you moving through levels of varying difficulties, playing as a simple shape or other object. Jumping over obstacles to get to the end, the game's genius comes from the fact that the level moves along in time to the music.


This necessitates well-timed presses in order to hop over spikes and gaps or wind your way through tight corridors. While I don't want to draw too big a comparison, if you liked the nature of Flappy Bird, this could be right up your alley.


At the time of writing, more than 59,000 people are playing, which kind of shows that the wait can sometimes be worth it in the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No judgements here, but if you're a little embarrassed about some of the games in your library, there's now a solution. Not long ago, it was rumored that Steam would allow you to hide titles from others, and now that reality has come to fruition.


In the most recent update to the Steam client, it's now possible to mark your games as private. A post on Steam says there are "times when you might want to keep a few of the games you own" a hidden secret from others. For whatever reason you have.




As such, any games you now deem it appropriate to make private can be hidden from anyone who isn't you. This includes: "your ownership, in-game status, playtime, and activity in that game." There's an FAQ that tells you how to go about doing this.


It begins at the checkout


The Steam patch also brings with it some updates to the shopping cart. Two new features have been added, which are:



Inline gifting - just in time for the holidays, you can now purchase gifts for multiple friends (and yourself) without having to make multiple purchases. Plus, gift messaging has been simplified to speed up the checkout process.


One cart across all devices - items in your shopping cart will now follow you across all devices where you're signed in to Steam. Note that during the beta, the cart will only be accessible within the beta client.




However, it also takes into account the new game privacy settings, by allowing you to hide them at the point of purchase.


Look, I'm not going to go into any details here. We all know why Steam would allow users to not advertise some of the things in their games list. We'll just acknowledge that this is now something many will find useful and we'll move on with our lives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[91Act has announced that their BlazBlue-flavored rougelite, BlazBlue Entropy Effect, leaves Early Access on PC on January 21, 2024.


This is the first time I’ve really heard of BlazBlue Entropy Effect, but that’s maybe not surprising since it only launched in Early Access on August 15, 2023. During that time, it’s racked up a 90% positive rating on Steam. In a world where some games seem to be perpetual Early Access titles, It may seem like a short time for a game to be in that state. However, it seems to be right on track with what the developer was aiming for, allowing them to incorporate player feedback and add new features before launch.




BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a side-scrolling roguelite similar to Dead Cells. The emphasis is on fancy, flashy combos, with lots of customization. I’m not super familiar with BlazBlue as a fighting series, but apparently, that’s not a problem. According to the store page (and also Steam reviews), the connection is largely an aesthetic one. It doesn’t tie its story or world into the established canon. It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the lore. Weird choice, but it sounds like it works.


BlazBlue Entropy Effect is currently available in Early Access. Its full release is set for January 21, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the most wonderful time of the year i.e. the last working week for us at the RPS Treehouse, and therefore the last week of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast for 2023. We take a look back at the year that was, in very broad terms - was 2023, in fact, a good year for games? - share our favourite games of 2023, and talk about the games we're playing right now. It appears Nate is quite unfamiliar with time travel films. We also think up some some resolutions for next year, and you've also got our regular recommendations to look forwards to at the end of the show. Plus, Nate does a thrilling end of year quiz with a question for each month. It goes about as well as you'd expect.

After a brief delay, we now have our first look at the UK boxed charts and things are looking pretty unsurprising up top.
EA Sports FC 24 has managed to score first place for the fourth week in a row, with Switch accounting for 25% of the game's sales (PS5 takes 34%, PS4 has 21% and Xbox Series picks up the remaining 20%). Hogwarts Legacy lands in second, pushing Super Mario Bros. Wonder down into the bronze position once again.

Famitsu has revealed the latest box charts from Japan (thanks, Gematsu) and it's another resounding triumph for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which scored an additional 94,682 units sold.
It's also a full house for the Switch once again, with every space in the top ten taken up by Nintendo's hybrid console. Familiar faces crop up this week, including Pikmin 4, Super Mario RPG, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our personal picks for the best Switch games of 2023.
2023 is all but wrapped up. It's been a colossal year in terms of the quantity and quality of software on all platforms. The mass layoffs we've seen across the industry in recent months are a worrying sign for anyone who cares about video games, not least for the creatives affected — all the developers and artists who crafted so many of the games we've enjoyed over the last 12 months. The breadth of experiences large and small that launched on Switch this year encapsulates not only what has made the console such a hit since 2017, but what can be accomplished when you invest in and nurture talented teams and people.
Here at Nintendo Life, our soon-to-be-published, reader-governed Top 50 Switch Games of 2023 will showcase the finest examples on the console in a tried-and-true ranking, but as we did last year, we wanted to highlight the NL team's personal picks. Rather than tabulate the team's favourites in ranked form, NL staff submitted their five favourite Switch games of the year and we're presenting the collection below, in no particular order. We feel this gives smaller titles a chance to shine on a broader, non-ranked canvas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year, players get the chance to vote for their favorite PlayStation games in different categories. Several titles have won in various categories, with Spider-Man 2 voted the PS5 Game of the Year. 


The win is not a surprise considering its stellar sales and the positive reception it has received from players and critics. The PS4 hasn't been forgotten, and Hogwarts Legacy won Game of the Year for the console. According to PlayStation, competition was tight, and it squeezed past Resident Evil 4 Remake by a mere half a percent of votes.

Kotick became CEO of Activision all the way back in 1991 and was integral to the company's merger with Vivendi Games in 2008 to become Activision-Blizzard. The company has undoubtedly flourished under his leadership, however, Kotick has also been a focal point of numerous controversies regarding sexual assault, harassment, and misconduct.

It's that time of year again when the aggregate review website Metacritic rounds up the best and worst games of the year, according to their Metascore. Today, the focus is on the "worst video games of 2023" - covering the lowest-scoring games released across any platform between 1st January 2023 up until 31st December 2023.
As usual, titles with "fewer than 7 reviews from professional critics" are excluded from this list. And if the same title (across multiple platforms) landed on the list multiple times, only the lowest-scoring version is featured. The games are ranked according to their Metascore as of 18th December 2023. Taking out the top spot this year is The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. As you can see, the list also includes titles available on Switch:

As we get closer to the end of 2023, a lot of sites are starting to compile all sorts of data to illustrate the year in games. The team at GamesIndustry.biz has put together its own "year in numbers" infographic, and one game that features throughout is the award-winning title, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
It has placed in the "top 3" best-selling games of the year in both the United States and the United Kingdom (note: digital sales not included). Additionally, in Japan, it was also the "best-selling boxed" game of the year. On Metacritic, it placed in the top three highest-scored games, and in terms of its web footprint, it was the third "most covered" game of the year.

Destructoid has too many FFXIV sickos for anything else to take the crown, which is fitting given that our own Chris “Eorzea’s Finest” Carter was an early adopter of the now-legendary MMORPG.


This, inadvertently, presents a bit of a conundrum in terms of selecting the “Best Ongoing Game” of any year. Live service games typically demand a lot of time. So it’s difficult – if not impossible – to find anyone who has played every entry enough to make a fair judgment. It’s hard enough playing the biggest single-player games of the year, let alone ones with potentially hundreds of hours of things to grind for. Can we really say Final Fantasy XIV had a better year than, say, Warframe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's official: The Bobby Kotick era at Activision Blizzard will end on December 29. According to The Verge, Instead of appointing a new replacement, the top Activision Blizzard executives will now report to Microsoft's game content and studios president Matt Booty. Several more higher-level Activision Blizzard employees will also leave the company in the new year with departures planned through March 2024.


A lot of changes up top


It looks like the ripple effects of Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard will really go into full effect in the new year. In an internal memo, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer highlighted some of the changes including the departure of Lulu Meservey at the end of January and Humam Sakhini at the end of December. In March, Vice Chariman of Activision Blizzard Thomas Tippl will leave the company as well as Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao, Chief People Officer Julie Hodges, Chief Legal Officer Grant Dixton, and CFO Armin Zerza.


End of an era


After 32 years with the company, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick's reign comes to an end. His resignation comes just two months after the acquisition of the company by Microsoft. After joining Activision in 1991, Kotick was responsible for several larger acquisitions in the industry including the Vivendi Games merger in 2008 that created Activision Blizzard and the acquisition of mobile game developer King.


However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows with Kotick. Just a few weeks ago his company agreed to pay over $54 million in a settlement with the California Civil Rights Department to settle a very messy workplace discrimination lawsuit.


Kotick will receive a farewell payout of at least $15 million when he leaves the company next week.

I’m not sure I agree, but game controllers are a very personal choice. For years, we’ve essentially been using different configurations of the same thing. To me, four face buttons feel like the optimal number for my thumb to handle, so my preference is the SNES controller, but I can respect anyone who prefers Sega’s six-button design.


And for those people, there’s now Retro-Bit’s Sega Saturn Wireless Pro Controller, which, beyond just being a rather faithful wireless translation of the console’s input, slaps a couple of analog sticks on there so you can also use it for modern game…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 brought a lot of classic games back into the fold, but I always knew one certain title would inevitably take the crown for best remake/remaster. Resident Evil 4 rides a fine line of feeling old and new to an impeccable degree, and I’ve got to admit, it’s a heck of a remake.


Resident Evil 4 is one of those games that transcends the legacy of the Resident Evil series itself. Personally, it wasn’t the first Resident Evil game I played, but it was the first one I finished. Its combination of action, RPG elements, and incredible campy dialogue just worked for me. And judging from how I’ve seen others talk about this game for almost 20 years, I’m clearly not alone there. It’s one of those games that frequently comes up in “greatest game of all time” conversations, and at one point in my l…]]></summary>

Final Fantasy VII Remake set the tone for what players could expect from this three-part retelling of the beloved 1997 Square RPG. The excellent updates to the combat system, the fantastic expansions on character relationships, and the stellar production values told us Square Enix is not taking the responsibility of remaking one of its most iconic games lightly. However, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks to take several components of the experience to the next level, largely thanks to its emphasis on side content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sawaki Takeyasu and Ignition Games' El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron somehow came out over 12 years ago. Takeyasu's company Crim purchased the rights a couple years after launch, and now the HD remaster finally has an April 28, 2024 date for Nintendo Switch. 


Crim announced the date for the port along with publisher Rainy Frog. El Shaddai will hit Switch both physically and digitally in Japan, including a physical deluxe edition priced at ¥8,250 (about US$57). Paying a little extra nets you the game along with a drama CD that comes with a script. Whether this is your first time ascending or you've been looking for an excuse to do so again, you can see more in the release date trailer. 




El Shaddai made its debut in 2011 to somewhat mixed reactions. It's a uniquely stylized action game that isn't necessarily going to be for everyone, but those who vibe with it are probably still thinking about it today. It had a pretty big promotional and crossover push at the time, including one that saw Japanese clothing brand Edwin release some pricey 503 Zero jeans in both Enoch and Lucifel styles. Unfortunately, none of the Switch releases come with themed clothing, so you'll have to hit eBay for a gently used pair. 


Outside of the bonuses included with the Japanese physical editions, it doesn't seem as if there's much in the way of new content here. If good ol' reliable El Shaddai—complete with its rock, paper, scissors combat and blend of 3D and 2D sections—sounds like a solid enough hook in 2024, mark your calendars for April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you love it or hate it, Starfield is one of 2023's most notable releases. For all the things that it does well, there's loads of stuff that Bethesda could improve upon, too. It sounds like improvements should be coming in 2024, though, according to the company's latest announcement.


Work on the company's latest flagship appears to continue in the background. Many of its most pressing improvements have already been outlined in the days and weeks prior, but a few more precious details have just been provided, suggesting what else might be coming.




While Bethesda's already confirmed some of the stuff that's coming to Starfield in 2024, such as new travel options, city maps, and a rough update cadence, there are some curious new tidbits present here. Specifically, the following:



New ship customization options.


New gameplay options that allow further difficulty adjustments.



Bethesda's not provided any detailed information on whether the team intends to simply add new customizations and difficulty sliders, or go all-in on the concept. A survival mode such as the one featured in Fallout 4 is something that players have expressed interest in, for example.


Bethesda's plans for Starfield in 2024


Further, Bethesda's previously confirmed update cadence, with new patches coming in every six weeks or so, won't be kicking in before February. This suggests that there's nothing new coming to Starfield in the next two months or so.


Of course, Starfield's first confirmed expansion pack, Shattered Space, is still on the way. No date has been set for that yet, but the post says it's part of the 2024 plan.


Bethesda's end-of-year post outlining the near future of Starfield development could, therefore, either be taken with a dose of skepticism or hype, depending on one's opinion of what's already there. Things really could go either way for Starfield's post-launch support.

I've been working on getting an anime beat going here, none of which would have been possible without the hard work of writers and contributors. It's an area that doesn't seem wholly outside our purview, and as games overlap even more with the medium, it only feels natural. And it only feels right to open with a recognition of that work.


Throughout this year, we dabbled in ideas, whether those were listicles, news beats, or longer-form features. It's something we hope to continue building up in 2024,…]]></summary>

Although his actual departure date is only a few days earlier, it means Activision Blizzard will be kicking off 2024 without Kotick at the helm for the first time in over 30 years.

        <updated>2023-12-20T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A promising new sprout.
Two years ago, a new developer called Singularity 6—comprised of various ex-Riot, Sony, and Blizzard staff—announced Palia, a “Massively Multiplayer Community Sim” that would aim to bring together the best parts of Stardew Valley and World of Warcraft. Since then, the title has been in early access on PC, and even though it’s still yet to arrive at its 1.0 release, a Switch version has arrived as part of the continued development. After spending some time with it, Palia shows a lot of promise, though it also notably still feels like an unfinished game.
The gameplay loop in Palia feels like it falls neatly between the grindiness of an MMO and the sedate pace of a farm sim. You engage in all the expected homesteading tasks, such as fishing, cooking, and tilling your field, to not just acquire gold to spend on some better furniture for your house, but also to progress an ongoing series of chained questlines from various NPCs that gradually lead you deeper into the world of Palia. You’re encouraged to take things at your own pace and engage in the activities that interest you, though fulfilling quests is usually the quickest way to secure yourself some ‘renown’ currency that can later be spent at a shrine to increase your focus meter. Focus is what you get when you eat food you cook for yourself, and this consumable resource will ensure that your labor will be rewarded with additional experience for as long as it lasts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its launch last year, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has received two DLCs as part of its Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline. The first, The Teal Mask, hit Switch in September; the second, The Indigo Disk, arrived last week, bringing with it plenty of returning legendaries and favorite starter Pokémon, too. Now, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have revealed The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be getting an epilogue that hits the game in January. 
The companies announced this today with a brief trailer that teases a new adventure in the "Land of Kitakami" that awaits trainers. The epilogue goes live on Thursday, January 11, at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET, and, outside of goodbyes to friends from the journey of Generation 9, today's trailer also teases what appears to be a new Pokémon. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


In order to play through the epilogue, you must complete "a certain postgame event in Pokémon Scarlet or Violet" and you must complete the main stories of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk. 
For more about the games, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then check out our Teal Mask impressions here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios have released The Finals update 1.4.0, a mixture of balance tweaks, quality-of-life improvements and crash fixes which is going down like the proverbial lead balloon among fans of the free-to-play shooter's Heavy class. I'm definitely here for the crash fixes - I can't get The Finals to run for longer than five minutes, which is a shame, because as Graham tells it, this is the most exciting new multiplayer FPS in years. Specifically, it sounds like a blend of Battlefield and Rainbow Six: Siege with a smashable toytown aesthetic. But enough about me and my computer's refusal to let me have fun. What's going on with those Heavies, then?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you have room in that big heart of yours for another fighting game, but don’t know what to try? 2022’s DNF Duel is free on Epic Games Store as part of their holiday giveaways. You have 24 hours to claim it.


I’ve heard of DNF Duel but know next to nothing about it. There was a lot of PR stuff coming at us in the lead-up and some excitement around the launch, but I think the fighting game market is pretty jammed up with heavy hitters to the point where it maybe didn’t catch fire. It’s a tough market for newcomers. It’s a spin-off of Dungeon & Fighter, which I also don’t know a whole lot about.




When I hear the acronym “DNF,” my mind first goes to “did not finish,” and then afterward goes to “Duke Nukem Forever.”


I do know something about the Epic Games Store. It gives away a lot of free games and doesn’t make any money for Epic. I installed it for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed and uninstalled it once that game came to Steam.


DNF Duel does seem like a good time, though. You certainly can’t argue with the price of free. However, you’ll have to act now-ish, since the sale is only for 24 hours. It ends on December 21, 2023, at 11am EST.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has announced via Twitter that an epilogue for The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be released on January 11, 2024.


As someone who didn’t buy the DLC because I didn’t quite finish Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the trailer tells me less than nothing. Which makes sense! It’s an epilogue, after all, so it would be easy to spoil things about the ending. Speaking of which, here are the requirements to access the new epilogue content:


-Complete a certain postgame event in Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet.


-Complete the main stories of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk.




The post suggests that the epilogue takes place in Kitakami and it’s a “new adventure,” but not much besides that.


As I said, I didn’t play any of the DLC. Timothy “Windchime” Monbleau did just recently and sounded like he had the last vestiges of optimism forcibly sucked from his soul. I welcome him to the void. There is plenty of room. I really don’t know how else to describe his critique of the expansion. If you want to know what it looks like when the lights go out in a human heart, it's a worthwhile read.


However, if you have different thoughts on The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, you might appreciate having the story tied up in a bow. Heck, maybe Mr. Monbleau will feel better about his agonizing experience with BBQs once it’s all wrapped up. Who can say?


What I do know is that the epilogue of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be released on January 11, 2024. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are available on Switch. You’ll also need the DLC to access the epilogue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 has hit a sales milestone of over 50 million units. It achieved this milestone just over three years into its life cycle.
Since the console’s launch in November 2020, over 50 million consoles have been purchased as of December 9, 2023, according to a press release. In July, Sony announced the PS5 had sold over 40 million units, meaning that roughly 10 million more consoles were sold in just the last 4 to 5 months.


The holiday season is likely a big contributor to this bump. Additionally, the October release of the much-anticipated PS5 exclusive Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (now the fastest-selling PS Studios game ever) undoubtedly drove players to pick up the console. 
The milestone is a nice way to cap off a busy 2023 for Sony. It launched new hardware with PlayStation VR2, the PlayStation Portal, and a smaller redesigned PS5. It also boasted marquee third-party exclusives such as Final Fantasy XVI and, for a few months, was the sole console home of the critically acclaimed Baldur’s Gate 3. 
It’ll be interesting to see how the console’s momentum fares going into 2024. So far, Sony’s first-party output consists of The Last of Us Part II Remastered arriving in January. Announced third-party exclusives include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in February (GI’s latest cover story) and Team Ninja’s Rise of the Rōnin in March. We're curious to see what else Sony has up its sleeve as the next year progresses.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Eyeguys and publisher Santa Ragione released the "treacherous visual novel" Mediterranea Inferno on PC in August 2023, and now it has a date for consoles. The latest announcement has the game hitting PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on March 5, 2024.


Mediterranea Inferno follows the act of Eyeguys' 2020 visual novel Milky Way Prince: The Vampire Star, which tackled similarly weighty themes. You can see some of its idiosyncrasies on display in the console announcement and launch date trailer below.




The story of Mediterranea Inferno kicks off as three young 20-something guys reconnect after a period of isolation that's all too familiar. This is a post-pandemic yarn that reflects collective trauma through the trio of Claudio, Andrea, and Mida, who are attempting to enjoy their Southern Italy retreat. 


Along the way you'll get to choose what they do each day, from visiting the local cemetery to relaxing by the pool, soaking in an endless summer that paves the way for insight into their psyches and unlocks hidden fears, obsessions, and the reality of dashed ambitions. 


Coming to grips with inner demons is an inevitable side effect of rediscovery in Mediterranea Inferno, apparently. Creator Lorenzo Redaelli produced hundreds of illustrations for the game along with handling the writing and music, so much like Milky Way Prince, there's a very personal touch behind it all. We have a little ways to go before that March console launch approaches, but in the meantime Mediterranea Inferno is available via Steam and Epic Games Store.

If Epic Games and my Switch were involved, Fortnite and Persona 5 Royal would've absolutely been included in the lineup, too. Motivation has lain mostly in co-op capers with friends, hangs with virtual pals, or in the battle royale-verse. Otherwise, nothing has truly given me the itch.
But I think 2024 could be a big one for me. Not only are a number of upcoming RPGs right up my alley, they align with new and existing motivations: hangs with pals and Japanese language learning. For the first time, I'm excited to embrace the grind both in-game and outside of it.

In the giveaway's "grand final day," two games are being made available, shutting things off a day earlier than we initially expected. You can still find all of the freebies from this year down below, and we have updated the following text to reflect this new information.

It's not that I dislike Gunfire's sci-fantasy co-op shooter - the multiple-dimension premise is pleasantly loopy, and I like the variety of procgen landscapes. There just aren't enough hours in the day, not when I'm replaying Into The Breach for the 14th time. Still, perhaps the introduction of a new mode built for quickfix, story-free sessions could persuade me to give 2023's 24th best game another whirl?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment announced today that the PlayStation 5 has hit another milestone. Over 50 million units have been sold through consumers just over three years since the console launched back in November 2020. According to Sony, the console experienced strong sales momentum this year due to the release of popular games.





"Achieving this PS5 sales milestone is a testament to the unwavering support of the global PlayStation community and their passion for the incredible experiences created by the talented developers from PlayStation Studios and our partners. We’re grateful for all of our players who have joined the PS5 journey so far, and we’re thrilled that this is the first holiday season since launch that we have a full supply of PS5 consoles – so anyone who wants to get one can get one."
-Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment



The milestone puts the PlayStation 5 console at the 15th best-selling gaming console of all time if you go purely by units sold. This puts it just above the SNES which sold a little over 49 million and behind the Xbox One which has sold about 58 million units since its release in 2013. For comparison, the best-selling console of all time is the PlayStation 2 which sold over 155 million units in its lifetime.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Jim sings (or should that be 'chants'?) the praises of one of his GOTY picks...

Let me make something clear right from the jump: Chants of Sennaar is a difficult sell. I love language, but the thought of spending my free time learning intricate grammar rules and making notes on noun variations hardly sings of an exciting way to while away the hours. But it is. Honestly.

The two genres aren't worlds apart - R-Type's bosses, for example, are very Gigery, but they're nothing like as icky as the creatures you face in Angel At Dusk, in which every projectile appears to be some species of maggot, and your ship is a sort of evolving flesh-moth faerie reminiscent of China Mieville's Perdido Street Station. Perhaps I can interest you in the demo?

In August 2014, photos and videos of Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS were leaked online, demonstrating evidence of unannounced fighters.
The leaks were seemingly confirmed following a copyright strike from Nintendo of America before being proven irrefutably real upon the game's eventual release later that year. Since then, the origins of the leaks have remained shrouded in mystery, but thanks to some diligent digging from Did You Know Gaming's Liam Robertson, we now have a better idea of what happened.

Seems far-fetched, but let's roll with it. 


As a reminder, WOW now comes in two broad flavours: classic and modern. In modern World Of Warcraft, you can expect three more updates for the existing Dragonflight expansion before the release of World Of Warcraft: The War Within later in the year. This introduces a new subterranean playspace, the Ringing Deeps, and is the first in a trilogy of expansions called The Worldsoul Saga.

Last week, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was updated to ver. 3.0.0 in preparation for the release of its Indigo Disk DLC. That patch came with some problems of its own, so now the Pokémon Company has shared some of the fixes that it is working on for the games' next update (thanks, Serebii.net).
The ver. 3.0.1 patch is expected to be released in late January 2024 and will target two bugs in particular. Outlined by @Pokemon_cojp (via @SerebiiNet), the first issue to be fixed will be an input drop-out when levelling up a sub-level 30 Inkay using a Candy. The second is to do with TM233, which currently requires Shieldon parts, despite that 'mon not being available in Pokémon Scarlet. Doh.

The Switch eShop has some questionable inclusions in its library; we have covered such lowlights as The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survival (a Last of Us 'clone', apparently) and the catchily titled Prison Life Simulator 2022: World FIGHT Battle GTA ULTIMATE, which speaks for itself. But it looks there's a new sheriff in town, one that makes these titles look almost like fully-fledged games. Introducing Courageous Reasoning Nori 4 Crossing Sea Street 4, whatever it is.
The above AI-generated image — which, yes, is actually from its North American eShop page — tells you all that you need to know about this upcoming 'game'. There's some onigiri and some, errm, guns? The AI makes a trademark slip rendering two gun-looking shapes, for sure, if those guns were multi-handled (or in one case, non-handled) and being held by distorted digits that vaguely resemble fingers. Or maybe toes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logitech's best value FPS mouse, the G Pro Superlight, is down to $60 when you buy it refurbished in the US at the company's official store. That's a huge reduction from its launch MSRP of $150 and even the $100 that the refurbished models normally go for. 
I love this mouse because it's extremely comfortable, with a smooth and streamlined symmetric shape that sits easily in the hand, with a lightweight 63g design. This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too. That's why I ended up with two of them - one in black and one in pink - and I still use them on the regular for Counter-Strike 2, Valorant and Warzone.

Over the last few weeks, the Destructoid crew has been juggling around nominees and winners for our GOTY 2023 picks, and this year's line-up didn't make those conversations very cut-and-dry. On the PlayStation front, our best PS4/PS5 game nominees list could easily pass for something over a decade old; it's very Destructoid. 


Final Fantasy pops up twice, once with a proper mainline entry, FFXVI, and again as an adorable rhythm game spin-off in Theathrythm. We also saw gems like Armored Core 6 and Alan Wake 2, games I wouldn't have put money on as getting sequels but was happily proven wrong. Oc…]]></summary>

I was going to follow up my earlier list, 10 bad games you should play, with a similar list around the same time of year. However, I don’t have a kusoge chambered for today, so I’m bumping it to a year-end list.


Do you know how difficult it is to play a bad game every week? Not just finding, playing through, and then writing up while also covering other responsibilities, but the mental toll it takes on a person. So, even though the column is informally called “Weekly Kusoge” (not related to Hardcore Gaming 101’s “Your Weekly Kusoge”), I skip a week whenever playing bad games just isn’t enough motivation to get out of bed.


With that in mind, I did 36 Weekly Kusoge articles in 2023. Here are the 10 “best” games I covered this yea…]]></summary>

So, fittingly, our Best Xbox nominees list wound up looking a little strange. Not only did most of us play Starfield on PC, but it's also where it felt best to play, if we were only opting for a single category. The nominees here that hit Game Pass feel like a testament to the service's strength, at least. Pick-ups like Sea of Stars and Jusant are nice to see, and certainly made the Pass' library feel more diverse.


But Xbox did have one winner that emerged in our voting, an early-in-the-year earworm we just couldn't shake. I'm talking about Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rus…]]></summary>

Seeds of Renewal update, Dark Heart, and The War Within


Early in the new year, World of Warcraft: Dragonflight will advance to update 10.2.5, Seeds of Renewal. The update will conclude the Dragon Isles storyline, task players with reclaiming Gilneas, unlock Dragonriding Worldwide and introduce Follower Dungeons. The Azerothian Archives will also be introduced as well as the Outland Cup.

Generation IX has caught a lot of heat for its glitches and lack of polish, but despite that, I personally have still had fun with these games. So someone like me should love The Indigo Disk, right?


Let me explain: here at Destructoid, we’ve played hot potato with Pokémon review duties. CJ Andriessen and Eric Van Allen reviewed Pokémon Violet and Scarlet respectively, each arriving at the same “6/10” score. And later, the impeccable Chris Carter took the reins on the first DLC pack, The Teal Mask, who concluded that it wasn’t as good as The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds and also gave a 6/10.

Following the events of 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, Barret, and Red XIII have escaped the confines of Midgar and gotten rid of the Whispers, meaning the possibilities as they step out into the vast world depicted in the middle portion of the original Final Fantasy VII are endless. In contrast to the corridor-heavy structure of Remake, the openness of Rebirth is immediately refreshing, but as I found out during both my hands-on and hands-off demos, the improvements don't even come close to stopping there.
The exclusive portion of my demo – the hands-off part – takes …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Creepy Jar, best known for their open-world survival sim Green Hell, officially revealed their next title as a sci-fi base builder titled StarRupture. Earlier this year Creepy Jar briefly teased the game during the PC Gaming Show though it was codenamed Chimera. In StarRupture, players will build up their base on an alien planet stuck in a catastrophic cycle of destruction by a nearby star.




Base-building meets tower defense


Players take on the role of a convict exiled from Earth with a sentence of mining and expanding industrial production while researching new technology on a hospitable but hostile new planet. As players build up their base with complex machinery, they will also need to fight waves of hostile enemy monsters. StarRupture can be played solo or cooperatively with up to four players.



"We wanted to come up with a new title that more accurately described the dangerous sci-fi world we’re creating. We had to break away from the mythology-based roots of Chimera and we landed on StarRupture. Originating from the base word ‘rupture’—as in a break or a disturbance—the new name also closely ties to the name of the planet’s star which is aptly named, Ruptura.
-Krzysztof Kwiatek, Founder and CEO of Creepy Jar



There's no release timeframe for StarRupture yet, but developer Creepy Jarp plans to continue releasing devlogs in the coming months as development progresses.

Just look at Among Us. Certainly, it wasn’t the first social deduction game, but in the wake of its success, there was an explosion of them. Some of them are just blatant carbon copies.


Now, these two runaway successes are colliding in Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting. It is entirely just Vampire Survivors wearing some Among Us-skin boots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a steady stream of leaks following the game's “closed alpha tech test” in late November, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League developer Rocksteady has issued an official statement urging players to “avoid spoilers where they can.”


Rocksteady addressed the situation via their Twitter account, writing that “it is very disappointing to see details being shared” and asking players to avoid them until the game officially releases on February 2. Check out the full statement down below:




Even though the alpha test that ran from November 30 to December 3 only featured a small part of the campaign to test online infrastructure, some plot details found their way online. Several details, including several well-known characters from the DC ensemble who’re making an appearance in the game and more, have reportedly been leaked online.


This isn't the first time details about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have surfaced on the internet against the dev's wishes. An earlier leak this year involved the game's online features and battle pass. Suffice it to say, that didn't garner a whole lot of positive reception for Rocksteady.


Warner Bros. is issuing copyright strikes to pull the images that are circulating, but if you want to avoid spoilers absolutely, you may need to mute the social media pages related to this game, or the Suicide Squad and Justice League in general, for the time being.


In fact, I’d avoid reading the replies to that Rocksteady tweet too. I certainly regret not doing so now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been encouraging to see how post-Steam Deck handheld PCs aren’t merely copying Valve’s homework.  The Asus ROG Ally made a (mostly) successful attempt at slimming down while upping performance, and now we have the Lenovo Legion Go: an even higher-concept portable with Switch-style detachable controllers. One of which transforms into a mouse. It’s a bit mad but I’ve always loved the concept’s ambition, even as I rendered working protypes a little less... working.
I’m happy to report that this, the Legion Go’s retail version, is far more resistant to such improprieties. Moreover, it’s basically the best Windows handheld out there right now – though some occasional fiddliness, and the looming issue of the Steam Deck OLED, mean it isn’t necessarily the finest palmable PC outright.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, ransomware group Rhysida revealed it had hacked Marvel's Spider-Man 2 developer, Insomniac Games. It posted images to prove the validity of its claim, demanding 50 bitcoin – roughly $2 million – from Sony within seven days or it would leak what it had discovered, as reported by CyberDaily. Sony did not comply with the demand and now the group has released more than a terabyte of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac Games. 
The total leak comprises more than 1.3 million files, for a total of 1.67 terabytes of data, according to VideoGamesChronicle via CyberDaily. The leaked data includes information about Marvel's Spider-Man, future Insomniac Games titles, release schedules, and private employee information like tax and employment forms, internal studio messages, and more. Game Informer will not be disclosing any of the hacked information. 
CyberDaily reached out to Rhysida and learned the ransomware group specifically targeted Insomniac Games. "Yes, we knew who we were attacking," a Rhysida spokesperson told the publication over email. The group also told CyberDaily its motivation for the hack was financial. 
Insomniac Games just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here. The studio revealed Marvel's Wolverine back in 2021, revealing this year that the game takes place in the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man.

Meanwhile, in the UK the MSI is also the cheapest 4K 144Hz option from a mainstream brand (though AWD-IT's X= XRGB27UHD is cheaper at £350), so I've linked that below as well at a price point of £399 (was £549).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a phenomenal gaming CPU thanks to its Zen 4 architecture and added 3D V-Cache which boosts gaming performance far beyond standard Ryzen 7000 processors. That performance - and extremely modest power draw and a reasonable price - has caused the 7800X3D to become the best selling CPU by a huge margin according to a German PC part retailer. 
Anyway, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D continues to drop in price. Recently we reported on a reduction in the UK, and now it's time for the US to get a turn on the deals train with a new asking price of just $339.99 - a full 40% off its US MSRP. That's a great price for a CPU that even comes with the breathtaking Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list.

        <updated>2023-12-18T21:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re looking forward to playing Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, especially to experience its story, your time on the internet just got a little bit harder. Some big plot points have leaked online, and naturally, developer Rocksteady isn’t happy.
Apparently, the leaks stem from a closed beta test in which audio from a pivotal story cutscene plus images and a video showing yet-to-be-revealed characters got out in the wild. We won’t share the details, but they’re not hard to find, so you’re on your own if you want to know more. We just ask that you refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments out of respect for others who wish to remain in the dark.
Rocksteady has posted a statement on its X account addressing the leaks, which we've posted in full below. 
It’s always a bummer to see leaks of this nature happen, and with Suicide Squad still two months away from launch, interested players who want to be surprised have several weeks of dodging spoilers before they can see the story for themselves. 
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League takes place several years after the end of Batman: Arkham Knight and stars Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, tasked with defending Earth from a brainwashed Justice League, courtesy of Brainiac. The cooperative open-world adventure has received a lot of vitriol from fans for its shooter-based gameplay, always-online requirement, and live service elements, such as its battle pass. 
You can watch the game’s most recent trailer from the 2023 Game Awards here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James McCaffrey, actor best known to video game fans as the voice of Max Payne, among other characters, has passed away. He was 65.
TMZ reports that McCaffrey died on Sunday after a battle with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer. A rep for McCaffrey tells the outlet that the actor died surrounded by friends and family.
McCaffrey's extensive on-screen credits include roles in Law & Order, Suits, and Blue Bloods, and video games such as 2008’s Alone in the Dark and 2005’s Area 51. However, Remedy fans knew him best as the voice of Max Payne in all three entries. Furthermore, McCaffrey voiced Thomas Zane in Alan Wake, Zachariah Trench in Control, and, most recently, Alex Casey in Alan Wake 2.

In a separate X thread, Remedy creative director Sam Lake offered his condolences as well. 
I’m heartbroken to hear the sad news of James McCaffrey’s passing. We worked together for more than 25 years. He was a lovely man and a dear friend. He was a key part of the Remedy family. He was a brilliant actor. No one could do what he did better than him. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/JLcEIMUT43

Sea of Stars is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, launching back in August, and is free to subscribers on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, as well as PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium subscribers. 
Alongside Sea of Stars' TGAs win, Sabotage took home the Best Indie Game award at the Golden Joysticks and was recognized by the British Academy Film and Television Awards as one of the best games from 2023. 


"Sea of Stars is the game of my dreams, and seeing its quest resonate so strongly with players and critics means the world to everyone at Sabotage," studio co-founder and Sea of Stars game director Thierry Boulanger writes in a press release. "The team behind this game is the most talented and dedicated group I could have ever hoped to create Sea of Stars with, and I'm again reminded of their brilliance as we progress with creating Sea of Stars' upcoming DLC, Throes of the Watchmaker. 
"For fans to have recognized our adventure in such an incredibly prosperous year for RPGs alongside new arrivals from the genre's biggest franchises, we simply just cannot thank you enough for supporting us, and we can't wait to show you what's next for Sea of Stars." 
In other Sea of Stars news, the game's soundtrack, which features guest tracks from famed Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda, is now available on streaming platforms. It contains all day, night, and pirate versions of songs in Sea of Stars. 
The complete original soundtrack for Sea of Stars is now available on streaming platforms!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiplayer shooters have become defined in recent years by the methods they use to withhold power from players, whether that’s a hero shooter's unlocks and battle pass or a survival shooter's vast map of scattered goodies. Even before these systems became du jour, however, shooters often required you to be good at them before you unlocked their real pleasures, whether by perfecting your rocket timing in Quake or memorising level layouts in Counter-Strike.

The Finals' real master stroke, I think, is that it has found a design that lets it be generous with power - even while containing an unlock system, a battle pass, and a not insignificant skill floor. Those things aren’t an obstacle between you and the childish joy of smashing the world to bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced that it is remaking the first saga of One Piece, and it's doing it with one of the best animation studios out there. 
Over the weekend, Netflix released a minute-and-a-half video celebrating the 25th anniversary of the One Piece anime, revealing in it that Wit Studio, the team behind Spy Family and the first three seasons of Attack on Titan, is producing "an all-new anime adaptation of the One Piece manga starting from the iconic East Blue saga." It will come to Netflix, although the company hasn't said when to expect it. 
Check out the announcement for yourself below: 


Notably, the East Blue saga is the first sage of the One Piece manga and anime, covering 100 chapters and roughly 60 episodes, respectively. This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. 
Beyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn't revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown.

Dragon Quest possesses so much history that any new game carries a degree of raised expectation. Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince delivers many of the conventions I’ve come to expect from the series: the vibrant opening song, the charismatic Slime, and the emotional storytelling I already associate with the franchise. But this game goes beyond those well-treaded territories, offering an intelligent and elegant yet simple approach to combat and dungeon design that makes it a solid spin-off experience.

Partly because they're basically all terrible, and partly because of how tiresome it is when everything is saturated with the same theme wherever you look. But Ebenezer And The Invisible World is about helping Scrooge run around London bashing capitalists and other evil spirits with his cane, and summoning friendly ghosts to prevent Caspar Malthus from genociding the working class. I simply could not find out what the hell was going on there.
Turns out, it's kinda good. But it has too many problems to reach much beyond that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's always saddened me that Simogo's brilliant text-based adventure Device 6 has been trapped on iOS-only devices since it first came out... ten years ago? Hell's bells, now I feel old. If you're unfamiliar with it, it's about a girl named Anna who must escape from a mysterious island, but the whole game is presented like you're reading a book - only one that you can click on and prod with your fingers to reveal new puzzles within that text. It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. 
Once you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller.

Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To celebrate Doom's 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS's influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as "boomer shooters" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.
I reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.

In a new interview with IGN, Kamiya told the publication he decided to leave "because I felt that the direction the company was heading in was different from my beliefs as a developer."
"Without that element of trust, I couldn't continue working there, and so I left, so that I could continue working in what I consider to be the right way," Kamiya said. "I don't think of games as products, but rather as works of art.

Now, roughly a month later, Final Strike Games has announced Rocket Arena will be sunset and its servers shut down in March. 
More specifically, Rocket Arena will come to an end at Noon PT/3 p.m. ET on March 21, 2024. As for why, the team doesn't really address that in its announcement but presumably, it has lost the player count needed to sustain its live-service, multiplayer model. 
Rocket Arena will be sunset on March 21, 2024 12:00 PM PDT. We’ll have some community events leading up to the date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are as many Doom mods as there are stars in the sky: jillions of accursed celestial bodies orbiting the supermassive black hole that is id Software, each infested with its own local flavours of cacodemons and keycards and shotguns. I've played just a handful - certainly, far from enough to pronounce myself any kind of expert - but I do feel like I've played one of the best in the shape of Siren, a Doom II total conversion from Dithered Output, the first episode of which can be downloaded free from Itch.io.


The mod's overall vibe is encapsulated, I think, by the sentient vending machine you meet a short way in, just round the corner from a rec room that contains a disembodied head on tentacles, and down the corridor from a tiered canteen full of ghouls and unsympathetic men with shotguns. You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? "No."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven’t been keeping up with player reaction to the latest Twar and Twarhammer games, but it seems players are none too pleased with Creative Assembly right now. In a rather dramatic open letter, the company's vice president Roger Collum has acknowledged that Total War: Warhammer 3’s Shadows of Change add-on and the recent historical strategy outing Total War: Pharaoh did not ship in a desirable state, with complaints ranging from wobbly execution to overpricing. The studio will try to make things right by offering partial refunds to Pharaoh owners and giving away DLC on top of the usual updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first mod I ever downloaded was for Skyrim. It replaced NPCs with Shrek. The second was a texture pack for Dark Souls: Remastered. I believe that these two examples form a representative sample of what mods are: quality of life improvements, and Shrek. Doom’s modding community, known by its file package WAD, is the Ur modding community. Thanks to John Carmack’s lightning-fast engine, creating levels and content for Doom has been accessible for 30 years. WAD devs have gone on to become fully-fledged game designers, and some WADs have been released commercially. The breadth and depth of this community formed the bedrock of game developers. And yet even with this pedigree, MyHouse.WAD is a miracle.

In a blog post, Naughty Dog explains it made the “incredibly difficult” decision to cancel the project after it apparently became so big that the studio realized it would need to devote precious resources to support it post-launch for years to come. When faced with the reality of having to become a studio solely dedicated to supporting a live service game or to continue making single-player experiences, it chose the latter. 
Here's Naughty Dog's full statement:
The Last of Us Online was originally intended as a multiplayer mode attached to The Last of Us Part II, serving as a successor to the first game's Factions mode. Ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Blade was one of the most exciting reveals from the Game Awards. Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.
Luckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:

Concept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane's environmental design, and Blade's positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane's games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition didn’t launch in the greatest state, but after months of fixes, the game has been deemed ready to launch on mobile devices. The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.
Like all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.


Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. 
In addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release. You can watch the game’s debut trailer here.]]></summary>

That might seem like an odd thing to say about your own company's activities. But when you look at what Nightdive have done in the last twelve months, it's less surprising. In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. 


In short, it's been a busy year for the remastering maestros. In the wider context of 2023, which has been simultaneously a banner games and a deeply worrying year for the people making them, I wanted to know how Nightdive view the last twelve months, and what the audience response to these projects means for the studio's future.

The biggest omission was New Game Plus, but Insomniac assured fans it would come in an update to the game before the end of the year. Unfortunately, the developer won't be able to hit that deadline, as it posted this update on social media yesterday.
 In case the image doesn't load, the text reads as follows:
Marvel's Spider-Man 2. We know players have been eagerly awaiting features such as New Game+ and Audio Descriptions, among many more. We have been working vigilantly on these features and require more testing to ensure the quality is up to our standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the Electronic Wireless Show podcast remembers the recently deceased E3 games show. Unfortunately, all that we can really recall is the occasional watch party, and maybe Keanu Reeves was there at one point? Was mostly just trailers, let’s be honest. Thus we also consider the events that replace it (with a side-chat on this year’s Game Awards), and how we’d design our own glittering showcase o' games.
We also share what we’ve been playing this week, make a single non-PC game recommendation (that also represents the strangest coincidence in EWS history), and take another look at the Lenovo Legion Go. Last time I talk about the Lenovo Legion Go for a while, promise.
You can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts. You can find the RSS feed here, and you can discuss the episode on our Discord channel, which has a dedicated room for podcast chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel have finally confirmed the full lineup and specs for their 14th gen Meteor Lake CPUs, which for now is comprised entirely of ultrathin laptop chips with the new Core Ultra branding. I appreciate that a PC gaming site might not be the most natural home for this information, considering both that these are not technically gaming CPUs and that that Meteor Lake’s most hyped-up feature is more of a productivity aid: a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for client-side AI work. However, as the new H-series parts also integrate Intel Arc graphics for the first time, there is some interesting potential for them to transform lightweight ultrabooks into viable gaming laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game openings have always been a source of fascination for me. As a player, you're excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you'll see, the challenges you'll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they've never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? 
In revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it's clear that even id's iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it's tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn't just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom's rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.

As a child, my family didn't have much money and I didn't get my first laptop until I was 16. Thus, I missed out on a lot of what are now considered PC staples. With dread, I'm often met with the accursed exclamation, "You've not played insert game before?" followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work? With games now stretching out at 100+ hours apiece, where is the time for old classics like Doom?
For me, approaching Doom was cathartic. Playing a game that's older than myself was certainly an experience, but I was shocked at how well it holds up.

But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESA hasn’t been able to open the doors to the highly regarded in-person convention.
However, Keighley is the driving force behind Summer Game Fest, a newly established but increasingly successful showcase effectively competing with E3.

I was fine to wait for a sequel years down the road, perhaps with Kratos and Atreus traversing through a new line of mythological lands and gods. But I wanted some reason to return to its beautiful world, adrenaline-inducing combat, and top-tier characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last time, you decided that ricochet attacks are better than blue shadows on dodges and dashes. I expected this outcome but am still glad to see a good quarter of you favoured cool essence over cool effort. We continue. This week, in honour of Doom's 30th birthday (we've already written about John Romero's memories, motion sickness, and inviting monsters to a birthday party, with more to come), I ask perhaps an impossible question. How could anyone ask you to pick between two iconic tools of ultraviolence. What kind of monster would. Yet we must. What's better: Doom's shotgun or Doom 2's super shotgun?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Othercide from French developer Lightbulb Crew is one of my favourite recent tactics RPGs. It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.
But I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.

It's a sci-fi odyssey with third-person shooting that looks and sounds a lot like Mass Effect, but it has one differentiating Big Idea (aside from Matthew McConaughey): time dilation, whereby time passes different in different places, depending on relative velocity and local gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.
Now, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption. Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. 


In the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is "nope" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up.

As the release date nears, developer Bandai Namco has been releasing more and more about the latest entry in its flagship fighting series. We learned about newcomer Reina last month, and recently went hands-on with the game, too – read Game Informer's Tekken 8 preview here. Now, Bandai Namco has revealed the first gameplay trailer for its "mechanized space ninja" Yoshimitsu. 
It did so with a new Tekken 8 gameplay trailer that shows Yoshimitsu ripping and slicing through various fighters in the game's roster. This ninja is no stranger to the Tekken series, having appeared in every mainline numbered Tekken game since the series' start – he's actually my favorite fighter, and for money, this is his best look yet. 
Check him out in the Tekken 8 Yoshimitsu reveal and gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Yoshimitsu unsurprisingly relies on his ninja sword to do a lot of damage to enemy fighters. And he does so with the speed the character is known for. 
Tekken 8 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Tekken 8 fighter reveal trailers for characters like Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, Marshall Law, Jun Kazama, and Reina. After that, read Game Informer's preview thoughts of Tekken 8 after playing the game for a couple of hours.

It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's "Show Me Mastery" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. 
"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. 
There is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.
December 12, 2023
God of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it's safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. 
You can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Consider yourself warned! This book contains scenes of graphic violence!" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. "Knee-deep in the dead!" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.
The cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve "Body Bag" Behling and Michael "Splatter" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: "Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary-tier monster cards on the table time: I do not like video game loot. I think that the popularity of "looting", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.
I distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mouse, an upcoming classic first-person shooter sporting a vintage rubber hose animation style, turned heads in May with its first look at gameplay. Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.
The noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.
Mouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. 


Mouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It joins the growing ranks of confirmed 2025 titles such as Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Big Walk, Usual June, and Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.]]></summary>

There's never been a better time to get into Ace Attorney. Developer-publisher Capcom has spent the last few years remastering and re-releasing every game in the series, and with the Apollo Justice trilogy, you can now play every mainline game on modern consoles. And even though the three games in this collection are unchanged story-wise, after going hands-on, we can comfortably say that they've never felt better.
The collection contains three games: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice – …]]></summary>

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. 
It was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too.

"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close," ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. "We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners." 
Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business "has blossomed in different ways," noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. "That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways."

Following the events of Tekken 7, the stage for Tekken 8’s story is set up to be perhaps the most over-the-top yet. In the six months since the defeat of Heihachi Mishima, his son, Kazuya Mishima, has installed a reign of terror over the planet using his devil powers. And while the setup is, quite frankly, a lot to take in, if the first four chapters I played are any indication, the level of spectacle and bombast reaches new levels in Tekken 8’s Story Mode.
The first chapter opens with Lars Alexandersson on a high-tech plane. He mentions the mission is to take down "evi…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20231206/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
