We've been wondering all month when Nintendo was going to reveal the 'Wave 2' DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and it's now finally lifted the lid on the next batch of tracks.
For this next wave, we're getting the Turnip Cup and Propeller Cup. That's eight tracks all up, including one new one. Players can expect to race on classics such as Mario Circuit 3 and Kalimari Desert to more recent ones like Sydney Sprint and New York Minute. Last but not least there'll also be the new course, Sky-High Sundae.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switch is coming later this year
I'm always looking for the next title to scratch my cozy game addiction, and it looks like the management sim Bear and Breakfast is the newest release to make that list. While I first heard about the game during the Summer Game Fest stream this year with the gameplay trailer, it was initially announced back in 2020. Players take on the role of a bear named Hank who builds and runs his own bed and breakfast in the woods, and will encounter all kinds of human and animal friends along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USaiP4ACTB4
The developers at Gumycat said that they "grew up on management sims," and that games like Theme Hospital were a huge inspiration for them. In addition to the "usual management stuff," they also wanted to create a game that tells a story.
The premise is that humans are coming back for some unknown reason, and they need a place to stay, so Hank and his friends decide to fix up old buildings around town for them. Players will advance through Bear and Breakfast's story by completing quests that entail the aforementioned management stuff like gathering materials, crafting, building, decorating, and so on. There's even a kind of puzzle element to booking guests, making sure they have food they like, as well as some kind of creepy subplot going on, too.
The game's art style reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons in an adorably nostalgic way, and the game's comedic writing is already being praised in the Steam reviews. With an ever-growing list of games to play these days, Bear and Breakfast has managed (see what I did there?) to find a place at the very top of it. In the past, I've found some management games to lack the depth to have staying power, but this title promises a rich, worthwhile experience that I can't wait to play.
Bear and Breakfast is out now on Steam and a Nintendo Switch version is slated for release in "2022."

Co-op first-person horde game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is taking a little extra time for development. Developer Fatshark announced today that the PC version has been pushed to November 30, while Xbox Series X|S will arrive later.
Previously set to arrive in September, the multiplayer PvE game is now splitting out its console and PC launches. In a statement, Fatshark says the Xbox version will arrive "shortly after" PC, with a specific date to be announced.
Fatshark also says that delaying a game is a difficult decision. But it's also one the team hopes shows its commitment to making Darktide come together.
"While we have been humbled by the great feedback on the game so far, we also need more time to improve stability, performance, and to mature key systems," the studio says. "Each is critical to making sure we have the best possible experience for you, the players."
https://twitter.com/Darktide40K/status/1552685635219210240
Squad-based test fire
If you're still eager to get in, there will be a chance before November 30. The team will be hosting a series of technical tests ahead of launch, in order to kick the tires on Warhammer 40K: Darktide.
The playtest sign-up page is live on Fatshark's site here, and appears to have sign-ups open for both Xbox and PC. Seems like a decent way to get in early if you can't wait to fight the Chaos horde.
Fatshark has built a pretty solid reputation with its work on the Vermintide series, creating some stellar co-op PvE games over the years. Safe to say, Darktide has some lofty heights to reach. So a little extra time for the studio to buckle down and work on fine-tuning things to be just right sounds good for the whole squad.
Warhammer 40K: Darktide hits PC on November 30, with Xbox Series X|S arriving sometime later.

In the vein of other, similar games about family and trying to hold tight to fading memories — like What Remains of Edith Finch, Behind The Frame, and Before I Forget — Hindsight is all about an older woman reminiscing about her life so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calico, Saint's Row 2, and Monaco round out the list
Microsoft announced the four Xbox Games with Gold selections for August 2022, and you know what? It's better than it has been lately. (A caveat-filled summary, to be sure.) During the month, Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can nab Calico, ScourgeBringer, Saint's Row 2, and Monaco: What's Yours is Mine at no extra cost.
Do you recognize these games? For once, I knew them all.
Calico is a community life sim game centered on a cat cafe, which is a cute premise. On the flip side, we've got ScourgeBringer, a frantic action roguelite game that I'd recommend playing if you aren't too burnt out on the genre — it's fun for a bit. Due to its balanced tone, Saint's Row 2 is the fan-favorite entry depending on who you ask, and Monaco is a still-pretty-unique co-op heist game that's getting a sequel all these years later.
[caption id="attachment_337024" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Subscribers are getting four Xbox Games with Gold titles in August.[/caption]
When to claim the games in August
Calico (August 1–31)
ScourgeBringer (August 16–September 15)
Saint's Row 2 (August 1–15)
Monaco: What's Yours is Mine (August 16–31)
Earlier this month, Microsoft said it would stop including Xbox 360 games in its usual Games with Gold rollouts — the company has "reached the limit" in terms of 360 games to give out, presumably due to partner interest. Starting in October 2022, Games with Gold will focus on "Xbox One titles and exclusive savings each month."
It's nice to avoid repeats, but I hope this is more of a positive shakeup and less of a value reduction. In some ways, it's surprising that Games with Gold is still around in a post-Game-Pass world. If you're in the habit, keep hoarding these games while you still can.
And if you revisit Saint's Row 2, spray a building for me, would ya?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subtitle options, closed captions, and a permanent reticle
October will be a big month for Resident Evil fans, as it should be. While the main attraction is the Winters' Expansion and Resident Evil Village Gold Edition on October 28, Capcom has more plans in store. Namely, a free accessibility update for Resident Evil Village.
Announced on Twitter, Capcom will add several accessibility features to the game:
Subtitle size, color, and background toggles
Speaker name display in story mode
Closed captions
Permanent reticle
It's a fairly light suite of options, particularly as some game developers have stepped up their efforts to reach the widest possible audience. That said, every little bit adds up, and it's never too late. The permanent reticle might help if you suffer from motion sickness.
I've heard complaints about a lack of FOV adjustments in Resident Evil Village, and that would've been a good inclusion here while Capcom is putting more time and energy into development. As it stands, there's an FOV mod for the PC version. Once again, not ideal.
[caption id="attachment_337050" align="alignnone" width="1920"] The accessibility update is free, but third-person mode will cost you.[/caption]
The Resident Evil Village accessibility update will be released "alongside" the paid expansion and all-encompassing Gold Edition, which are due on October 28.
The Winters' Expansion comes with third-person mode, a new "Shadows of Rose" storyline, and extra characters and stages in The Mercenaries Additional Orders — Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and yes, Lady D. Altogether, the bundle will cost $20.
I look forward to going HAM in October with a full third-person run, a Rose playthrough, and more arcadey horde slaying. I just hope the Mercenaries scoring isn't a pain.

Dolls houses, Superliminal, Gorogoa, and Disney World. What do you get if you mash them all up? You get one very excited and confused 8-year-old, and you get Maquette, an Annapurna-published game that came out on PC and PlayStation in 2021.
The core puzzley concept of Maquette is recursion — you know, things-within-things, inception, whatever you want to call it — which have been explored successfully in the aforementioned Superliminal and Gorogoa, where everything is a matryoshka of clever twists.

We've been watching with envy as Falcon Age studio Outerloop's vibrant South-Asian narrative game, Thirsty Suitors, has been showing off its gorgeously goofy ex-fighting action RPG through their publisher, Annapurna. We assumed we weren't going to see it on Switch — but how wrong we were, as today's Annapurna showcase confirmed that the game would be coming to Switch alongside other platforms.
Thirsty Suitors is a game that tells a story of South Asian culture, from its choice of colours to its cooking minigame, with over-protective parents, a skateboarding mechanic, and a combat system that's built around flirting and insults. Protagonist Jala returns home to her family after a few years to discover that her exes all want to fight and/or kiss her.

It's hard to say just how good Strange Horticulture is. The pitch on paper seems so specific — an occult puzzle game themed around flowers — that it's hard to imagine how it could be fun to thoroughly examine a plant's leaf shape to make sure that you're not going to accidentally poison a customer. Or... maybe purposefully poison a customer.
Strange Horticulture, a game about running a florist and selling plants to the titular "strange" townsfolk, has a mixture of things that set it apart: Firstly, the occult bit, which is told through a veil of strange goings-on, many of which will require that you read between the lines. Secondly, the map, which is full of secret places to explore, many of which you will only find through cryptic clues. Thirdly, it lets you have all the power. Well, all the power afforded to you by your job, selling flowers. Flower power, if you will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whatever's coming from Cardboard Computer, it'll be worth the wait
Kentucky Route Zero is probably in my top five favorite games of all time. The game's whole feel, its subject matter, the process that went into making it — I'm fascinated by the whole thing, which is why I'm so thrilled to get absolutely any news from the development team behind it, otherwise known as Cardboard Computer. While it hasn't been all that long since the release of Kentucky Route Zero's final act back in 2020, the team has been hard at work on their new project, as they showed during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase.
While we have almost no information about what type of game it will be, where it will be set, any story points, etc., we did get a brief look at Cardboard Computer's new workflow, and what little we saw already has me giddy to learn more. Developers Jake Elliot, Tamas Kemenczy, and Ben Babbitt showed off their new animation software, which utilized some kind of face-mapping tech rigged up to a character model.
https://youtu.be/UeQYiKQoH_g?t=1312
They stated that this is the first project where they will be focusing more on performance, and while Kentucky Route Zero was a fairly slow, static game, this new project will be more "lively" with fully-animated characters. The story will also be more upbeat this time, they said after reminding themselves that while Kentucky Route Zero had comedic moments, it was ultimately a tragedy. Apparently they started working on the new game right away after Kentucky Route Zero wrapped up, and they've had this idea kicking around for as long as their debut title.
I'm thrilled to even get an update, and will be awaiting any more with bated breath. Although the details are sparse right now, Cardboard Computer is one of those developers that I have faith will deliver something amazing every time.

2017 was a stellar year for video games. So many excellent titles launched that you might have even let some slip you by. And if What Remains of Edith Finch is one of you, there's some good news: this emotional story is out now on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.
Revealed as part of today's Annapurna Interactive summer showcase, What Remains of Edith Finch got a next-gen update today, bringing Giant Sparrow's adventure game to the new console hardware. It arrives with 4K and 60 FPS support. And what's more, owners of the game on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 can upgrade to the newer generation versions for free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKpcpwM5onA
Otherwise, the game is available on the Xbox store and PlayStation Store. (It is also on Game Pass, at the time of this writing.)
What's left of those who came before
If you need a pitch on Edith Finch, it's a narrative adventure game where you play as the titular heroine Edith. The Finches are a superstitious family, governed in part by one constant rule: every member of the family has their own room. And the house the Finches live in just keeps growing, up and up.
As you enter new areas and learn more about the Finches who came before, trying to discover why Edith is the last Finch alive, you also learn about your family members. Each area is a new vignette, often with its own mechanic and narrative device, exploring what happened to them and why. And also, maybe a little bit about their life.
It is a sublimely beautiful game about life, legacy, family, death, mourning, and a really, really big house. As we covered five years ago and still today, What Remains of Edith Finch is very worth your time. And those rooms will likely look even better with all that hardware bolstering them.

Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg, the creators behind Wilmot's Warehouse, Loot Rascals, and I Am Dead, are back with a relaxing co-op game about the "joy of flight" called Flock. The upcoming PC, PlayStation, and Xbox game made its debut during this afternoon's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, and it was my highlight of the stream. It's so pure!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WANeJSsV3Js
Unsurprisingly, the art direction is fabulous, as I've come to expect from Hollow Ponds.
I'm also into the laid-back vibes I'm seeing so far — the idea is to accumulate a hoard of cute critters as a flying shepherd, and you'll be joined by other players, adding to the coziness. The Steam page mentions online co-op; I'm hoping for couch co-op, too.
According to the developers, you can "charm" creatures into joining your flock, and with hover-sheep in the mix, you can use wool to make "hats, cardigans, and even socks."
[caption id="attachment_337096" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Soaring with other shepherds in co-op.[/caption]
Flock is coming to PC (via Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass.
Another cool game that Richard Hogg worked on, Hohokum, has found its way onto Steam. After seeing Flock for the first time, my mind immediately went back to that PS3/Vita-era game about exploring fantastic worlds. Some found it a bit dull, but I loved it.
Even if they haven't caught on with a massive audience, I really appreciate this team's games. This one, in particular, seems like it has the right ingredients to resonate.

We saw some glimpses and updates from some really great titles, both new and old, during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase today, and they closed out the show with a look at a new title from Giant Ape Games called The Lost Wild.
The trailer opens showing off a lush landscape teeming with dinosaurs, and a protagonist running through a dark forest with a compass. As the protagonist finds what appear to be old research facilities, it's only a matter of time before some T-rexes show up, and we get a glimpse at tense encounters with the giant predators. It looks like the core of the game is going to be exploration and stealth, and I'm sure there's even more to this adventure than we got to see today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA1AkZn2PrE
The whole thing is definitely giving off the tense, grounded feel of the first Jurassic Park film, and I can tell just from this short trailer alone that this game is going to scare the crap out of me in the best way. The game was announced previously, but this is the first time we're seeing Annpurna's name attached to the project.
We don't have any word on a release window yet, but The Lost Wild is available right now to wishlist on Steam.

In today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, the developers of the gorgeous, stupidly incredible Outer Wilds said that the game is still coming to Switch.
"You did not collectively hallucinate our announcement of Outer Wilds for the Nintendo Switch," said Mobius' spokesperson in the showcase. "It's possible that we were a bit over-optimistic on the time frame. At this point, it's possible that we just fundamentally misunderstand the Gregorian calendar."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.
The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a pre-alpha trailer and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. 


Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. 
According to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.]]></summary>

Players control Clementine McKinny, a bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trust mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. 
When you're not blasting apart enemies, you'll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.
Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-28T19:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. 
The game, which premiered during last year's Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister's wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.


The trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex's emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala's mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.
Thirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It's a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. 
A Steam demo goes live later today if you're still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.]]></summary>

A dev diary during today's Annapurna Showcase doesn't reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog's face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy.

In a little over a month's time, NIS America will release its newest retro compendium. In preparation for Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol. 3, the publisher released a spotlight video focusing on one of the two games featured in the release, Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure.
Considered a forerunner of the Disgaea dynasty, Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure was originally released for PlayStation in 1998, before eventually making its way west via a Nintendo DS port in 2008. A tactical RPG with a leisurely pace and non-intensive difficulty, Rhapsody won over fans as one of gaming's first true "musicals," telling its delightful and thoroughly wholesome tale through fully voiced song and dance sequences.

Live A Live, Square Enix's HD-2D remake of its 1994 cult classic, has stormed into first place on its debut with an impressive 71,137 units sold in the week of 18th to 24th July. That's more than double the game's next-closest competition, Nintendo Switch Sports — which has been doing extremely solid sales numbers since it entered the charts in April/May.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now we just need a Steam port of GoldenEye 007
Yesterday, the Steam platform released its newest client update, which adds a compatibility function for the Nintendo Switch Online range of classic controllers. The new-school/old-school gamepads can now be used for a plethora of Steam games, bringing further options to the massive library of PC titles.
The Nintendo Switch NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis controllers will function with essentially all Steam releases, though one will obviously have to adapt to certain titles, given the required number of buttons or the button layout required for each game. Button customization will, obviously, be your friend here, but while it will be neat to play Streets of Rage 4 with an authentic Sega Mega Drive controller... God of War? Perhaps not so much.
It should also be noted that these controllers are not always the easiest to come by. While the NES and SNES controllers are now far more available than they were at launch, the Nintendo 64 controller remains something of a tough cookie to track down. No doubt a restock will be forthcoming, but Nintendo has always been a little on the lax side when it comes to readily available hardware.
Other controllers added in the new update include the HORI Fighting Stick Mini 4, the Qanbi Obsidian, and Dragon Arcade sticks. For full details on the new update, visit the official Steam forums right here.

Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is set to release on 20th October, and while that still seems like a long way away, Ubisoft is making sure it doesn't feel light-years away. Today, the developer published a video interview with the game's lead producer, Xavier Manzanares, which gives more details about some of the game's new features.
The interview covers the game's new playable characters, Bowser and Edge; the latter is seen in action with moves that prioritise close and mid-range combat, while Bowser's size makes him a more unusual addition. These characters were revealed in an earlier trailer, but this new gameplay footage means you can get a head start on planning your ultimate line-up.

It also seems to have accidentally added incestual relationships. Oh, and people are aging much faster, too. It’s a weird time to be a Sim, that’s for sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dell's G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell's willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we're seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make sorting all those games a little easier
A new beta is rolling out for the PlayStation 5 today, adding some much-requested features. 1440p video output, gamelists, and other updates are entering the PS5 beta for select participants today.
One big new feature is the ability to support 1440p HDMI video output, letting those who own 1440p monitors or TVs use the setting. If the game supports 1440p native output it will allow for it. Or, if at a higher resolution like 4K, the system can use supersampling.
The option is under the Screen and Video section here:

PS5 beta gamelists
Gamelists are also headed into the beta, and this is likely a feature that every PlayStation 5 owner will want to see roll out soon. These are essentially like the PS4's folders, allowing players to sort their collection.
Up to 15 gamelists and 100 games per gamelist are allowed. These lists can include disc, digital, and streaming, and the same game can be added to multiple gamelists. Finding what's still in your backlog should be a bit easier once this rolls out to everyone.

More PS5 beta features rolling out
A few other updates are on the way too, including comparisons for 3D audio and stereo. In-progress activities will pop up at the top of the game hub, making it easier to hop back in.
On the social side, beta users can request party members to start sharing their screen. Basically, a "let me watch you play" button. And if you're in a party and someone starts up a joinable a game, a notification will pop up. Probably useful for all those Guilty Gear fight nights or Overwatch stacks.
Beta users will also be able to send voice messages and stickers to each other, within their groups.

The beta is rolling out to invited participants today, and Sony's goal is to roll these features out later in the year. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later, because my PS5 home is getting a little cluttered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As long as you have iOS 14 or Android 2.2+
Nintendo has added the ability to share Nintendo Switch Online friend codes on mobile devices as of this week, with a few provisos: mostly OS related.
Here are the iOS patch notes with the details:
Share Switch Online friend codes on mobile update, version 2.2.0
・ You can now send friend requests using your friend code. (Accepting a friend request requires a Nintendo Switch console.)
・ You are now able to copy your friend code as a URL and/or save it as a QR code, which others can then use to send you friend requests.
・ Other minor changes have also been implemented.
・ System requirements have been updated to iOS 14.0 or higher.
As you can see, the implications are pretty great overall. If you're randomly meeting someone for the first time, sharing a friend code is as simple as getting out your mobile device and making the exchange that way: even in the form of making a QR code for someone else to use on the spot.
Remember of course that there has to be provisos because it's the friend code system. To accept it, you need to use the Switch console itself when you actually get home. Also, you need specific versions of your chosen OS (iOS 14 for Apple, Android 2.2+) to actually use this feature.
Still, progress!

Developer Cyberconnect2 has released the first teaser trailer for its upcoming strategy sequel Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2. The anthropomorphic/steampunk RPG will bring its epic, turn-based action to PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms at some point in 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OolRShEoq9I
The sequel to 2021's highly rated Fuga: Melodies of Steel and the fifth release in Cyberconnect2's Little Tail Bronx franchise, Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 will see our band of survivors continue their voyage aboard the rickety but technologically adept battle tank — Taranis. Set against the thinly veiled backdrop of an alternate World War II, Fuga: Melodies of Steel blended turn-based action with high melodrama and a storyline of loss, sacrifice, and redemption. Themes that are expected to carry into the new sequel.

While the developer has not offered too much in the way of information regarding the sequel's mechanics, Fuga 2 promises to boast a boosted and improved battle system, stronger strategy elements, and a brand new, choice-based storyline that will leave players with a roused spirit, a broken heart, and an empowered soul. My words, not theirs. I should probably note that. While understandably niche, the first release was a real hit with the fan community, who will no doubt receive today's sequel reveal with much joy. Fire up the Soul Cannon... Who is the ammunition this time around..?
Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. The original game is available to purchase right meow on all aforementioned platforms.

Developer Frogwares has announced that it is working on a remake of its 2006 adventure game Sherlock Holmes The Awakening, a curious cross-over that sees Sherlock Holmes and his trusty sidekick Dr. Watson tackle a series of strange disappearances relating to H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.
The project is said to be a 'massive remake and rewrite' of the original, with development commencing in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which forced Frogwares to cease development on its previous project. With circumstances surrounding the invasion still heavily affecting the studio, it has also decided to leverage Kickstarter to assist with the game's funding, allowing fans to support the studio in exchange for rewards and a price reduction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you've played The Sims 4 since then, you'll have automatically downloaded it unless you've been playing offline. While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

A StarCraft: Remastered free download is front and center for this newest Prime Gaming update: set to arrive at the start of August.
As Prime Gaming continues to shuffle in new games alongside of other publisher-driven services, Amazon Prime subscibers have new games to claim. Several are relatively unknown, a few are higher-profile indies (comparatively), and the one Amazon chose to put front and center is StarCraft: Remastered. Not paying for a Blizzard game sounds pretty great right now to a lot of people, I bet.
If you need a refresher, here is what StarCraft: Remastered does differently:
Full graphical upgrade of the original StarCraft and the StarCraft: Brood War expansion
Widescreen UHD support for up to 4K resolution
New matchmaking and leaderboards
Player profiles that track individual statistics
Cloud saving for campaign progress, hotkeys, and replays
Higher fidelity music and sound
Switch between Remastered and the original StarCraft
Beyond StarCraft: Remastered, you can find the full free lineup below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Fixed some issues"
Nintendo and Monolith Soft just pushed out the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 day one patch (since Japan is getting the game now) and it's pretty small!
For starters, the bulk of the update seems to be enabling the season pass. The studio also added the ability to open up the main menu (X) in-game and obtain delivery-based bonus items from the season pass. It also "fixes some issues," which are likely last-minute development fixes. But in my experience throughout the entire game, I didn't really see many technical problems outside of some framerate drops in massive areas.
With that in mind, the physical edition is fairly well preserved already (so far, at least), as all you're getting is "minor fixes" and the ability to add in (mostly future) season pass content, which required an online connection anyway.
You can find the full notes here.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 day one patch notes - Ver. 1.1.0:
Added the ability to receive items delivered in the Expansion Pass.
The main menu can be opened by pressing the X button during play.
Fixed some issues to make the game more comfortable to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Master crafters.
The music of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has rightly gained lots of attention since the game was announced. With a team helmed by legendary JRPG composer Yasunori Mitsuda (of Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, and Chrono Cross fame), and made up of Xenoblade series veterans ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota, there's no doubt the music will be quality. And basically, every single trailer has confirmed that.
One of the most arresting tunes we've heard is the game's main theme — A Life Sent On. Lead by a beautiful Celtic-sounding flute, and evoking powerful emotions, this stunned us from the very first trailer it was used in. It's haunting, and despite sounding a little Celtic (a bit of a signature sound for Mitsuda), there's something very unique about it. And it turns out that it's all down to some custom-made flutes.

The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe season pass wave 2 DLC finally has a date: Nintendo has just revealed that it will be out on August 4. You can find the full track list and trailer below! Nintendo has also updated their database site to include info on wave 2.
As a reminder, we covered wave 1 already, and there's more on the way. The pass will contain 48 courses overall, and there's six waves in total. Nintendo isn't giving us a date for wave 3 yet, but reiterates that "everything will be out by the end of 2023." You can access it via buying the Booster Course Pass on its own, or through an Expansion Pack membership.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bring Money
The Pokémon Company has announced that its "pop-up" retail outlet The Pokémon Center will be returning to London next month, offering UK visitors the opportunity to once again roll out the dough for a gaggle of exclusive, limited-time merchandise themed around the popular gaming brand.
Pokémon Center London made its debut back in the fall of 2019, where it notoriously drew ridiculous queues of up to five hours as eager fans stood in line to buy Pikachu dressed as a little city gent. The furor led to all sorts of stock shortages and daily rule changes for the retailer, as it struggled to cope with the unending pressure from both Londoners and visitors traveling to the capital specifically for the cause. In total, some 30,000 customers shopped at the store within its four-week opening period.
The store was set to return in 2020 but was postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
https://twitter.com/PokemonNewsUK/status/1552228398017265664?s=20&t=z80LaQjSZtEBGK9gmBYntg
The new Pokémon Center London is being established in conjunction with the Pokémon World Championships, which are being held at London's ExCel Centre between August 17-21. According to a new tweet, the outlet will feature merchandise, photo opportunities, and themed areas. Predicting a rush, the store will operate advanced visitor bookings, as well as a virtual queueing system. Given that the outlet is open for a mere weekend, it is incredibly likely that it will be an unprecedented success.
If you're looking to visit the store yourself, then be sure to follow the Pokémon UK Twitter account. Details regarding queue registration will be released in the very near future.
The Pokémon World Championships kick off at London ExCel August 17.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These cats are quite possibly the antithesis of Stray
The countryside holds many secrets. And some of those are probably best left undiscovered. At least, that's what it seems like in The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, an upcoming horror adventure from Cloak and Dagger Games.
Cloak and Dagger are no stranger to horror or adventure, having explored the genres a fair bit in previous games. For The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, though, the studio is teaming up with Wadjet Eye Games as its publisher.
Wadjet Eye was founded by Dave Gilbert and has delivered a number of stellar adventure games, like Unavowed and The Shivah. This pairing up seems like one to watch for anyone who likes some creepy horror.
The Excavation follows antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who's writing a book on the barrows of England. As she explores the countryside and documents the treasures she finds, Bateman is drawn to a small village called Bewlay. Things begin to get stranger and stranger, as the locals seem wary and her assistant never arrives. And then the dreams start.

Don't go in the barrows
While horror games are easy to find these days on Steam, folk horror has a bit of a different air to it. Jump scares are easy to find, but a town with some creepy atmosphere and probably some kind of ancient ritual? That's fresh and interesting.
It's been quite a week for unusual and interesting horror game reveals. We spotlighted Slay the Princess, an upcoming horror visual novel about a very scary princess, earlier this week. And now Hob's Barrow is adding more incredible art and creepy vibes to the mix.
Seems like it's a good time ahead for fans of indie horror games. No date's been set yet, but The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is currently planned for a 2022 launch. You can find it on Steam here.

Putting the cat in catastrophe
The second I saw the announcement trailer for Stray, I knew it was a game I was going to play on release day, no questions asked. I am a cat mom, after all, so anything with a cat, let alone as a playable character, is a big win in my book. While it was pretty easy to get me on board with the premise of Stray alone, one thing I wasn't expecting was just how rich and compelling the story was going to be in this game. I mean, it was published by Annapurna so that should have been my first clue, but even so, it slipped my mind.
To start, the worldbuilding was incredibly detailed and made talking to NPCs, a pretty important mechanic when you'…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gone but not forgotten
Roblox is one of the most popular video games in the world, but even for those who don't play the game, a single sound effect has transcended into meme culture to become instantly recognizable: the "oof" death sound. In the wake of some ongoing licensing issues Roblox has had with sound effects, the team behind the game has announced that the infamous "oof" has been removed from the game entirely. They explained in a tweet from the official Roblox Twitter account that they "created a replacement default sound" and that they "plan to expand [their] Avatar Shop with a whole range of both old and new sounds in the future."
https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1552037832578846720
Roblox's trouble with the licensing for the sound started back in 2020, after the "oof" had pervaded online spaces, and video game composer Tommy Tallarico realized that was a sound he created for a game called Messiah. The "oof" was removed from Roblox back then as well, but was reintroduced after Tallarico reached an agreement with the developer, so that creators could buy access to the sound for about $1. It seems that the issue resurfaced and they weren't able to settle things this time, much to the dismay of fans who love the "oof" sound.
The tweet prior to the announcement of the sound's removal discusses the new plan for how sound effects will play a role in Roblox moving forward. The developer stated that they will be getting sounds "directly from the creators and licensors," and that "users will also be able to customize sounds for their avatars in the same way they customize clothing." That sounds like a pretty interesting step forward for the game, but I have to admit it feels like the end of an era with the "oof" sound effect being gone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kirby is second
Nintendo has provided "most downloaded games in Japan" Switch charts for 2022, and it's looking real good for Pokemon Legends.
Providing rankings for the first half of 2022, Pokemon Legends takes the undisputed crown from every other Switch game: benefitting from a January 2022 launch. Right behind it is Kirby and the Forgotten Land, followed by Nintendo Switch Sports (which is doing better than some expected it to).
From there we dive into third-party land with Monster Hunter Rise, then are reminded of the raw staying power of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (which launched in the region in 2014), then we're back to third parties with Overcooked 2, Among Us, and Brave Corps Defeats the Demon King respectively for places six through eight. Then at spots nine and ten we predictably have Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which are hanging on in multiple regions, not just Japan.
The rest of the list is a fascinating microcosm of what does/doesn't work in Japan (the Kingdom Hearts cloud versions seem to be doing well, with two showings in the top 30 overall), and reinforces the evergreen nature of many first-party Nintendo games.
Nintendo also has annual rankings here for 2020 and 2021.

Nintendo of Japan's "most downloaded" Switch charts for the first half of 2022 (Top 10):
Pokemon Legends
Kirby and the Forgotten Land
Switch Sports
Monster Hunter Rise
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
Overcooked 2
Among Us

NIS America has announced that it will be bringing its 2021 remaster Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix to the west on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms in 2023. The flashy shmup is already available on PlayStation platforms in Japan and also on Nintendo Switch worldwide.
https://youtu.be/FO-DEnE6TEw
Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix is a revamped — or "remixed" — edition of the 2007 arcade hit Raiden IV, which has itself been revisited multiple times in the years since its original launch. This definitive edition of the vertically scrolling shooter features new levels, alternate enemies, and bullet patterns, as well as several modes including Arcade, Score Attack, and Boss Rush. New Dual Play and Double Play options allow for co-op multiplayer action... and even the option for a single player to control two ships!
The visuals have been spruced up to HD quality, while the pulse-pounding score has been fully remixed and re-recorded, offering both new and veteran players the most definitive and electrifying edition of the challenging action title. If you have been waiting on a PC port or a localized release of this title, then you at least know that you won't have too much longer to wait. Better get that trigger finger in gear.
Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix will launch in the west on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox in 2023. It is available right now on Nintendo Switch.

Grand Theft Auto 6 could see a female protagonist at the lead. A new report from Bloomberg drops several details on the upcoming GTA, alongside a general shift in Rockstar's culture.
According to people familiar with the game who spoke with Bloomberg, the next Grand Theft Auto will have a playable female protagonist. She'll be Latina, and part of a pair of leads in a Bonnie and Clyde-style story.
It's also planning to grow over time, it seems. Original plans for Grand Theft Auto 6 called for large swaths of both North and South America. But Rockstar has reportedly pulled back a bit, and cut the map down to a fictional version of Miami and the surrounding area.
The expanse won't end there, though. According to Bloomberg, Rockstar plans to c…]]></summary>

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I've been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I've begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring's boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

Jump height has been fixed/normalized to avoid too much variance
Volleyball now has "slide attack" mechanics (move the stick left and right after a bump)
Bowling physics were adjusted
Global play is in
Playing with friends has been enhanced, with Room IDs
Unstable online connections will now be more visible via a wifi icon in the lower right-hand corner

The details discuss how a revamped and improved studio culture has influenced the game's design, including its playable protagonists, writing, and tone. 
GTA 6, which Rockstar confirmed was in active development in February, will reportedly star two playable bank robbers in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired tale, and the female protagonist, a first for the series, will be Latina. The game is set in a modern-day, fictionalized Miami and its surrounding areas, which signals a return to Vice City. Despite being set in a single city, the game is said to already have more interior locations than any GTA game. Still, the studio plans to regularly update GTA 6 over time to add more …]]></summary>

"Usually, by the time a game comes out, I've compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet," he says. "Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it."
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce "Incantamentum" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. "I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it'," Gilbert tells me. "And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Force isn’t strong with the remake of classic RPG Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic, which has been delayed indefinitely following a badly received demo shown internally at the end of June. Bloomberg reports that the game’s design director and art director were subsequently fired from developers Aspyr Media during the week after the demo was finalised. Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more "realistic".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.
The problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.
Developers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.
The remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.

The twist is that there's no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up," he tells me. "In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation."

This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red's fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. 
After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years. Then, this month, the publisher announced that it would be re-revealing Skull and Bones on July 7. That return brought with it a brand new look at gameplay and new details about ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.
Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. 
While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. 
PS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. 
The play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. 
Lastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.
PlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.
What do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2? Share your thoughts in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier: Automata is my favorite game of all time, renowned and criticized for its unconventional narrative design and eccentric characters. Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. 
Someone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg
July 25, 2022
Randomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a "holy" site. I'll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there's not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. 
Famed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata's best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, "So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown." McDonald also said that it's impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. 
Is this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!

Monolith Soft has struggled to recreate and magnify the novelties of the first Xenoblade Chronicles adventure since its 2012 release. The third chapter in the science-fantasy JRPG series suffers the same frustrating fate as XC X and XC 2. Despite its first-rate combat and character progression features, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bloated trek across vast but lifeless environments further diminished by an unaffecting narrative with one of the worst ensemble casts in the franchise.
XC 3 employs a real-time battle system where “Arts,” advanced skills mapped to the controller’s face buttons, give fi…]]></summary>

Which makes me wonder: what's the best day of your gaming week, reader dear?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been delayed. The upcoming adaptation was scheduled to launch on September 1 (with a Switch port coming sometime later). However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum's solo adventure. 
Fans have been critical of Gollum's perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn't reveal a new release date, only saying it's delaying the game "by a few months." 
Here is the complete delay statement: 
 

First of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.

We are dedicated to meeting our community's expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.

That being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.

We are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!

Daedalic Entertainment

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character's Gollum or Smeagol personalities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. 
Can confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.
July 23, 2022
The director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. 
Ultimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent.

A message shared by the publisher's Twitter account yesterday states that the presentation begins at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. Other than that, it offers no hints as to what games will appear. Annapurna's last showcase took place just over a year ago, where it highlighted a variety of new titles and game updates, such as Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye, The Artful Escape, and more.

Annapurna has been riding a nice wave of momentum lately due to the well-received launches of Stray, the cat-focused post-apocalyptic adventure game developed by BlueTwelve, and Neon White, the anime-inspired platforming action game developed by Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix. The publisher has several noteworthy titles in its portfolio that could get a spotlight on Thursday, some of which haven't been heard from in a good while. There's a good chance we'll see more games such as Cocoon, Open Roads, Thirsty Suitors, Storyteller, and Skin Deep. And those are just the games that we know about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A flying wyvern known as the Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.
Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.
In our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. "The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it," he wrote. "The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak."
This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a "AAA action platformer" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.
“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”
This quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid's back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro's long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like "Chester A. Tabby II" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle," which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The MultiVersus roster expands today with the news that LeBron James, Rick Sanchez, and Morty Smith are stepping into the ring. 


King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now. 
What do you think of LeBron, Rick, and Morty joining the roster? Who else would you like to see join in? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On this week's episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we turn our attention to shooters and their demands. They all want our undivided attention and for Hayden and I, it's fast becoming a bit much. Believe it or not, we're adults with clothes to fold and ovens to pre-heat! Daily quests and inane challenges aren't bringing us back, if anything, they're beginning to drive us away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s so many dodgy things I could say about Resident Evil Village’s upcoming DLC’s The Mercenaries Additional Orders mode and its inclusion of a playable Lady Dimitrescu, along with magnetic Nic Cage wannabe Karl Heisenberg and perennial favourite Chris Redfield. Instead, I’ll be a nice lad and keep shtum. Aside from the extra characters, Additional Orders brings more stages and some other improvements to Mercenaries that Capcom haven’t elaborated on. Watch the trailer for it below and imagine being inside Lady D. Oh crap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cycling in video games leans towards the extreme and the exciting: bombing downhill at murderous speeds, professional racing, treasure hunt, and such. I'd like to see more of the mundane too. For many adults, a bicycle is simply a way to get to work, to the shops, or to see your pals. So after battle royale shooter PUBG: Battlegrounds added bicycles, I decided to commute around the stag & hen weekend warzones by bike as much as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like a building game that doesn't need constant babysitting. I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

        <updated>2022-07-22T15:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.]]></summary>

Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn't go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.
Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.
The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.
Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.]]></summary>

While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.
Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.
If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.
Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.
Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-21T20:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.
The publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. 


Splinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. 
Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft’s open-world title set in James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy universe, will now launch sometime in either 2023 or 2024. The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. 
Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

But what do dogs (the superior pet, if we're being honest with ourselves) think about this feline adventure? 
We've enlisted Regan, my real-life chihuahua, to help us play Stray. Watch as she almost certainly immediately falls asleep in my lap while I play the first hour or so. If you have any questions, feel free to jump in chat and ask! 
But that's not all. I recently convinced Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner to let me use my corporate credit card to buy a Gundam model. So, legally, I now have to do something work-related with it. Let's build it on stream. That's right, it's a double feature tonight, folks! Cats and Mecha. What a time to be alive.

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.
In creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn. Two years ago, the debut trailer for its third game, Open Roads, was met with excitement.

Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours.

That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we'll get to a proper badminton game.
Badminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. 
For those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. 
The new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. 


Dragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.]]></summary>

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.

Boisterous business discussions and the clanking of silverware ring out from the crowded patio of a corner restaurant in the heart of Champaign, Illinois, a small college town two hours south of Chicago. Lording over these hungry patrons is the stoic face of Deep Silver Volition. The studio’s logo hangs a few stories above the lunch spot on the side of a brownstone building. Many eating here today are likely Volition employees, and they have reason to celebrate with a feast, as their studio’s next game, Saints Row, is nearing completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we learned in June, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered swings to PC this August. If you've been wondering how the game will take advantage of your gaming rig, a new trailer runs down the list of features that will make Peter Parker’s adventure even more spectacular. 


Spider-Man will be treated to a host of graphical and performance upgrades, such as: 
Unlocked framerates
Nvidia DLSS AI performance boost
Nvidia DLAA AI enhanced image quality
Ultra-wide monitor support
Ray-traced reflections (for compatible PCs)
Improved shadows
DualSense controller support
As a reminder, this Remastered version of the 2018 title launched on PlayStation 5 as a pack-in with Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. As such, the PC version is the first time it's been available as a standalone product. In addition to introducing Peter Parker's redesigned face, the remaster also includes the Black Cat-focused story expansion, The City That Never Sleeps, and exclusive suits such as Spidey's outfits from Spider-Man: No Way Home. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launches on Steam and The Epic Games Store on August 12. You can read our review of the original PS4 version here. Miles Morales is also slated to come to PC later this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.
However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.
Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.

I've enjoyed revisiting this meta first-person puzzler, but sometimes I can only manage small chunks before its endlessly repeating corridors start to feel like they're bearing down on me a bit. Thankfully, its latest quality of life update might just be the thing I need. As well as introducing a swathe of new accessibility features, its auto-walk function now has a toggle option - and as developers Crows Crows Crows have noted on Twitter, this means that "so long as you're in a straight corridor it allows the game to play itself!"

Players can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. 


Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5’s Hot Wheels expansion is out and reader, I am in love. Firmly leaning – shoving, really – into the base game’s arcadey side, it’s a gleefully silly collection of physics-mocking race events across an eye-catching tangle of twisting, looping tracks. In between challenges, and flashbacks to covering the floor of my grandparents’ house with ribbons of orange plastic, I’ve also been testing how the DLC’s new skybound setting performs on PC.

The game’s reveal caught my eye thanks to its striking art direction and unique gameplay. I’ve spent the last couple of days battling the darkness as the titular Victoria Bloom, a precocious young girl searching her ancestral home for her missing uncle after it’s been overtaken by shadow monsters. Armed with a powerful flashlight, you’ll battle a living darkness in an ever-changing mansion steeped in mystery and secrets. 
I’m enjoying the game, but it took longer than I would’ve liked to get used to its strange control scheme. Eyes in the Dark plays like a twin-stick shooter, with players using the left stick for movement and the right stick to aim their auto-damagi…]]></summary>
