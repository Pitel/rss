A little less than a week ago, Nintendo once again showed us the power of the Direct, and gave us a ton of announcements and a few surprise releases. We have a full recap here, but if you're a visual learner, Nintendo recently tweeted out a full infographic of what was announced or reconfirmed, with the first-party cream rising to the top.

If I had to guess what would win a "most excited" poll, it would be Mario RPG
I'm still cautiously optimistic about Super Mario Bros. Wonder (I hope the gimmicks are more than skin-deep), but based on the almost universally-positive reaction to the Super Mario RPG revival, I'd say that takes the highest hype spot. I mean, it's at the top of my list too! Re-releasing Pikmin 1 and 2 was a genius move as well, as you can get the entire mainline Pikmin series on one platform now. That's kind of become a calling card for the Nintendo Switch: a successor to the 3DS in its own right, collecting both old, new, and new-again games in one spot.
As for Detective Pikachu Returns, it's in a super weird spot. We're years removed from the film, and I'm the only person I know who actually played the original Detective Pikachu from start to finish. It'll be interesting to see how the game performs, and if it gets another gigantic amiibo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not a huge one.
Nintendo is once again proving itself to be the master of optimisation on the Switch, if the estimated file size for Super Mario Bros. Wonder is anything to go by.
As reported by the folks over at Nintendo Everything, the official eShop is currently listing the upcoming platformer at a rather reasonable 4.3GB (quick note: the US eShop lists the game at 4.5GB, so we're guessing the exact figure is somewhere between the two). This is, of course, subject to change over the coming months, but it sounds like you probably won't need to organise a mass clear-out of your SD card anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Beyond the Stars
Bethesda has confirmed that the "Constellation Edition" of its upcoming space opera Starfield will not contain an actual disc of the game itself, and will instead feature a download code for the chosen platform. The publisher noted this controversial development in a tweet from its support team.
"Hello!" said the team, responding directly to a fan's question. "All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs". The tweet has since been deleted from Twitter.
The community understandably responded unhappily to the news, with some decrying the return of "non-physical physical editions", while others pointed to the continued slant toward a future where archiving games becomes a much-more-difficult venture without hard copies of the games themselves. The response was overwhelmingly negative, with some, (some as Twitter's Wario64), pointing out that certain adverts for Starfield's physical release had clearly stated that a disc was included.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYEiTdsyas
The removal of the initial tweet suggested that there were crossed wires somewhere along the chain of communication. And that indeed proved to be the case, as it now seems that while the standard edition of Starfield will feature a physical disc including game code, it is purely the $250 Constellation Edition that will not — a digital download code for the title being issued as part of this version. And so, anybody who wishes to pick up the Collector's Edition and own a physical disc of the sci-fi spectacle will, at this stage, be required to pick up both versions.
Starfield launches September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X/S.

We had just about managed to get Bowser's Mario Movie love ballad, 'Peaches', out of our heads after singing it on repeat for the past three months. Now the voice of Bowser himself Jack Black has ensured that we're humming it all over again after he performed the song live at last night's The Game Awards 10-Year Concert.
Dressed in the full king of the Koopas garb that we previously saw the actor wear in the Lyrical Lemonade music video, Jack Black's rocking vocals were accompanied by a full orchestra as he performed the song live to a crowd of fans — who, by the sounds of it, couldn't help but sing along.

The cyber attacks prevented many players from logging into Diablo IV, and the hack-and-slashers that managed to log in were at risk of “high latency and disconnections” in the always-online RPG. That tragically forced many gamers to step outside during the hottest weekend in recent memory. Thankfully, Blizzard now states the DDoS attacks have ended, meaning everything should be working as normal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But the Blessed Mother returned
Blizzard Entertainment was hit with a huge DDOS attack this weekend, which ensured that several titles, including recent release Diablo 4, were offline and unplayable for an extended period of time. The DDOS attack has since passed, and the dungeon-crawling sequel is, as of this writing, fully playable once again.
While players started noticing issues late Saturday, the attack was first noted by the studio itself on the morning of Sunday, when a brief message posted to Twitter said that the team was "currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers". Players had noticed that they were unable to log in to titles such as Diablo 4 and World of Warcraft during this time. The studio then confirmed that it was undergoing a DDOS attack, wherein parties intently overrun a server with requests, causing an information lockup or even a full collapse.
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1673082677115666440?s=20
Later that day, Blizzard announced that the attack had ended and that normal service had been resumed. The DDOS attack effectively lasted less than a day but, given that it was Sunday, it no doubt cut into some valuable playing time for those who are only able to delve into Blizzard's worlds during the weekend hours. Malicious DDOS attacks remain a problem for online communities, whether targeted at specific websites or full gaming networks and streaming services.
Diablo 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

This one is another recommendation from my local video game dispensary. They told me they thought I had asked them to keep an eye out for The Flintstones: Bedrock Bowling on PS1 (also on PC).

You don't have to be dishonest about it.
The Flintstone’s was something that was perpetually syndicated when I was a kid, so even though it was off the air for 20 years before I was born, I’m rather familiar with the source material.

The Gamecube started off with a bang in 2001. As if Star War: Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader, Luigi’s Mansion, and Wave Race: Blue Storm weren’t enough to get fans through the year, Pikmin and Super Smash Bros. Melee dropped on the same day on December 3, 2001. It would be crazy to pit any game against such a titan today, but Smash Bros. wasn’t yet the institution it would soon become.
I have a lot of warm memories of Pikmin. I remember failing to get the last piece of the Dolphin on my first attempt and arguing about the existence of purple Pikmin on message boards. Good times.
In preparation for Pikmin 4 (which is one of my most anticipated games of the year), Nintendo has released the first two games on Switch in a nice, clear HD update. There's precedent. They previo…]]></summary>

Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life offers a slightly different take on the well-worn farming sim genre. As a new resident of the Forgotten Valley, you’re still here to revitalize an old farm and socialize with the townsfolk, but it’s that second aspect that takes a central role here. The point of your new life in this hamlet isn’t to save a farm or to stop the development of a theme park...
You’re here to make a life for yourself, one that is filled with love, family, and friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A test of patients.
The past few years have reminded us that many countries’ healthcare systems are not in good shape. Even so, it’s hard to appreciate the challenges that healthcare workers face if you’re not one. Fall of Porcupine aims to do this in an approachable way by putting players in the scrubs of 2D animal doctors. Unfortunately, the latest release from Critical Rabbit isn’t the hard-hitting medical drama wrapped in a fuzzy waffle blanket that we would’ve liked. This cute game has so much potential, but it needed more care and a focused narrative to really soar.
An impressive amount of research and interviews have gone into the game’s much-needed commentary – everything from full beds to alternative medicine to corporate hospital management. It’s a shame all that research results in a flatline story with repetitive mechanics. You control Finley, an anthropomorphised pigeon and the newest doctor at St. Ursula's Hospital in the town of Porcupine. As you tend to patients, your boss, white cheetah Dr Krokowski, is constantly less than impressed with you. There’s also a fellow newbie doctor, a suspicious janitor, a chief physician, and MANY more characters who take the form of various animals.

According to The Verge, the FTC has been attempting to argue the Switch is "very different" to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - suggesting it's not really part of the same market by comparing its technical capabilities, with lines about its frame rate and how it compares in terms of GPU teraflops.

Sega gave blue blur fans another look at the upcoming release Sonic Superstars at its recent Sonic Central broadcast, but one thing it didn't lock in was a release date.
It's due to arrive at some point in Fall 2023 and there's now apparently been "multiple retailer listings" for Sonic Superstars - suggesting the game will be released on 17th October. This specific date can be found on websites like Target and GameStop in the US, with the price locked at $59.99.

One of the third-party highlights of the latest Nintendo Direct earlier this week was the announcement Batman: Arkham Trilogy would be coming to the Switch this Fall.
As exciting as it is, some new information about the physical version has now surfaced. The Switch version's FAQ has revealed the hard copy will only include Batman Arkham Asylum on the game card, with the other two titles (Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight) requiring a download:

However, not every update lives up to expectations, and while it's still the better version of this bundle, Sonic Origins Plus' main attraction doesn't quite stick the landing.
For the uninitiated, Sonic Origins launched one year ago today, letting players speed through Sonic the Hedgehog 1, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Sonic 3 & Knuckles from the Sega Genesis, as well as Sonic CD from Sega CD with the option to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles in all of them (except Knuckles in Sonic CD, for some reason).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curse the bricks on the hedgehog
During the third annual Sonic Central, Sega has announced that LEGO Sonic will be playable in the DLC for the upcoming Sonic Superstars. Even beyond that, if you pre-order Sonic Superstars, you’ll also get the ability to transform Robotnik into LEGO Eggman. Leggman!
That’s about it. Uh, here’s a trailer.
https://youtu.be/qi8zAunO9xw
That was fun! As you can see, it does everything I told you. Sonic the Hedgehog is replaced by the LEGO minifig of the classic ‘90s veteran. I’m not sure how accurate this is to what the DLC will be like, but I’m hoping that Robotnik will always appear like that if you use the skin.
It’s really classy for Sega to announce both DLC and pre-order bonuses right together. Classic Sega. This seems like not a lot for DLC. Will we see LEGO minifigs of the other characters? I’m guessing no, but you never know.
Sonic Superstars is, of course, the upcoming classic-styled sidescroller with four-player co-op. I’m looking forward to it, but I keep getting flashbacks to the co-op in the Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. It was so awful to whoever was stuck as Tails. When my husband and I were first dating, he was really excited to find out that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has co-op. I tried to check his expectations, but even then, he was extremely disappointed when we finally sat down to play it. It’s only slightly better than handing your sibling an unplugged controller so they can pretend to play along.
Sonic Superstars is going to be released sometime later this year for PS4/PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC. Not sure about the LEGO Sonic DLC, but with Leggman being a pre-order bonus, it sounds like it will be released alongside the game.

If bringing a novel to the big screen is a tough job, then making a movie into a video game tends to spell doom from the get-go. And we don't mean the good kind of Doom. Go ahead, try to think of a film's video game tie-in or even a less rushed adaptation that's even a tad beyond "meh". If it took your mind no more than one second to think of The Chronicles Of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, then congrats. You win.
But that's an absolute anomaly in the history of video games. We're talking about a tie-in that'd be better than its movie even if the movie were good. Given the adaptation curse that no one can deny, it'd be no surprise if a Doom 2 mod inspired by a novel would result in the ultimate failure. But... it did not.

Not content with dropping an HD port of the original Pikmin during the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, the platform holder also saw fit to furnish us with this slightly revamped version of its sequel, the very excellent Pikmin 2. Hooray!
Yes, Nintendo has planted us firmly in the Pikmin 4 hype zone prior to that game's launch and, if you've yet to play this 2004 GameCube gem, you're in for a great big treat. Pikmin 2 takes the wonderfully unique and inventive foundations of its timeless predecessor and gently adds more variety to the mix, resulting in a game that's arguably the pik (we are so clever) of this franchise thus far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And it's only for Partners
Twitch is forever altering the way it allows content creators to make money, but it usually comes with a drawback or two. Take the recent changes to revenue splits. Some felt that this was a step in the right direction, but given that the new program comes with a bunch of boxes that need to be ticked, not everyone can benefit.
Now, there's a new feature that's being implemented, which could also be seen in a less-than-good light for most. According to a recent blog post, Twitch is introducing "Hype Chat," a feature that gives viewers the chance to literally buy chat messages. The idea behind it is to let users "stand out" in the overall chat.
[caption id="attachment_388337" align="aligncenter" width="572"] Image via Twitch.[/caption]
Amounts that can be paid for messages vary from $1 to $500 (though Twitch says that streamers can set a minimum amount up to $100). Depending on how much a viewer pays will depend on the duration of the pinned comment, as well as character length, and the visual design. All this while affording the person streaming the ability to "earn a share of the revenue from each Hype Chat purchase."
But, as usual, not everyone will get the benefit of this new feature. The blog post goes on to say that Hype Chat is only available to Partners, so smaller channels will miss out. However, the Amazon-owned service does say that it may look into implementing this "more broadly" in the future.
For some, though, it may be too little too late to win back support. With big streaming names like xQc and Amouranth already jumping ship to rival platform Kick, things are looking a bit tough for Twitch right now, though it should be noted that it is still pulling in millions of users each month.

Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up gratis to all of its users next week — So grab your sword and knapsack, as we're delving into the silly fantasy adventure of The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos, which is available to download for free from June 29.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6o7m6XIq-k
Developed by Artefacts Studio and released in the fall of 2020, The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk is a tactical RPG that features all of the castle-running, monster-slaying, loot-gathering action one would expect from the genre, but with far more comical and dopey thematic than the standard grimdark fare. Based on an audio series by French author John Lang, this adaptation has players guide a party of hapless heroes through a series of quests, winning the day because of, rather than in spite of, their clumsy nature.
If you're a fan of tactical role-playing action, or fantasy dungeon crawlers, and want to check out a fun twist on a familiar favorite, then be sure to bag yourself The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos when it becomes free to download between June 29 - July 6. Before then, you still have the opportunity to pick up current freebie, immersive grim sim theHunter: Call of the Wild.

Sega has announced that Sonic Frontiers is getting a buffet of new features in celebration of Sonic’s 32nd Birthday. Not a big buffet, but it does feature New Game Plus, which I’m surprised it took this long to be added.
On top of New Game Plus, Sonic Frontiers is getting some goofy cosmetics, a special collectible Koco, new moves, and some new challenges. That’s all pretty groovy, but I don’t know what else to really say about them.
https://youtu.be/vAB_BG60APA
New Game Plus, I can certainly understand the value of. Sonic builds up his skills throughout the game. This will allow you to start over with all of those intact and just completely wreck house with a combination of too much power and experience. Both your skill tree and power-ups will carry over.
I should probably go back and finish Sonic Frontiers. I played it pre-release and fell off at maybe the 10-hour mark. I was covering it for guides, and everything in that game has its own dedicated tutorial. I also feel like, while I like Sonic the Hedgehog games (some of them), I have to be in a very specific mood to play them, and I’m kind of feeling that right now.
The Birthday Bash update is completely free to anyone who owns Sonic Frontiers, and is dropping today at 5:00 pm PST. If you don’t, it’s available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.

Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue.

If you start off on the area to the North of that island using a campfire on the beach (near the lava flow), you can fly directly south, across the straight, and onto a ridge. You might find it easiest to spot at night because the memorial itself is a bright blue hologram.

Beyond memorable roles in film, such as Charon in the John Wick series, Reddick has been a voice in video games since 2009’s 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand. He had a prominent role in the Destiny series. After news of his death, Destiny 2 players gathered to pay respect.
The memorial is part of the latest update for Horizon: Forbidden West, and demonstrates how well-respected Lance Reddick was among those he worked with.
Horizon: Forbidden West and its Burning Shores expansion is available on PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Sonic Central stream to celebrate the anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, Sonic Team announced that the second free content update on Sonic Frontiers' 2023 roadmap, titled Sonic's Birthday Bash, is available today. The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.
The Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.
Sonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

Old-school cool developer Sunsoft has announced that it is planning a crowdfunding campaign in hopes to bring three of its Japan-only Famicom releases to modern platforms. The campaign will officially launch on the Japanese crowdfunding site Campfire between July 14 - August 31.
The three titles up for rerelease are Edo-set platformer Kanshaku Tamanage Kantarou no Toukaidou Gojuusan-tsugi (1986), side-scrolling fantasy adventure The Wing of Madoola (1986), and finally the casually-paced text adventure Ripple Island (1988). None of the titles ventured outside of Japan and thus have since faded into obscurity, a status that Sunsoft is hoping to revitalize.
[caption id="attachment_388355" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image from Shmuplations[/caption]
Should the Campfire campaign prove successful, the three titles will be ported to PC and Nintendo Switch. In addition, the publisher is hoping to release physical gold cartridges of the games for the Famicom platform. Way back when, Sunsoft was one of the few companies allowed to release its titles on specially branded cartridges, (see image above), and while many of the studio's games were awarded this prestige, gold-tinted cartridges were a goal never achieved by the studio. Hopefully, Sunsoft will be able to realize its glittery dream, if 40 years after the fact.
Localizations for the titles were not confirmed, and seem unlikely, but we will let you know should this change.

That's the journey I've been on with deckbuilding RPG Cross Blitz this week. I first heard about it last month back when word hit that it was coming to early access this year, and I was instantly taken with its chunky animal character sprites. There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic Superstars received prime placement in both the Summer Game Fest 2023 stream and this week's Nintendo Direct. As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.
Players will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.


While Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.
Sonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Depends on your definition of "fishing"
If you were hoping to be able to whip out your rod and catch some alien fish in Starfield, there's bad news on that front. Todd Howard himself has confirmed that fishing won't be a feature in Bethesda's upcoming RPG.
In the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Xcast, Howard is asked a bunch of questions regarding the game. About 14 minutes in, he's asked whether there's going to be any "space fishing" in Starfield. Howard begins his answer by saying that it "depends on your definition of 'fishing'," curious as to whether it refers to the collecting or killing of fish.
https://youtu.be/AIbnDyv6g1c?t=880
Co-host Gary then gets more specific by asking whether he'll be able to have "some kind of rod" that can be put into a lake in order to retrieve a fish. Howard then crushes Gary's (and probably other people's) hopes by confirming that the game does not have that feature. However, this does open up the possibility of it being including in an update, expansion, or even something modders could implement.
As we know, Skyrim was given a fishing feature for the Anniversary Edition that dropped in November 2021. Given this, it's not too far-fetched to consider that Bethesda may add this peaceful hobby to Starfield at some point in the future. But that's just speculation on our part.
When it comes to open world games, players like to take a step back from the action for a bit. The chance to do a spot of fishing while exploring an alien world sounds appealing, so it's a bit of a shame that Starfield won't have it on release.

It’s been a bit of a barren six years or thereabouts for Switch-owning Tomb Raider fans, without so much as a remastered golden oldie or even (mercifully, perhaps) a quickie cloud version of one of the new-fangled reboots to enjoy on Nintendo’s platform. However, all of that is just about to change with the imminent arrival of The Lara Croft Collection, which hits the eShop on the 29th June.
Not to be confused with The Tomb Raider Collection, which gave lucky PC players a massive 13 games from across this hallowed franchise to dig into, this much slighter package comes courtesy of Feral Interactive (Alien Isolation, GRID Autosport) and contains 2010’s Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light and its follow-up, 2014’s Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris. On the one hand, it’s perhaps a little disappointing that we don’t get to have any of the old Tomb Raider classics involved here but, on the other, what we are getting is two surprisingly great isometric spin-offs from the mains series that do a fantastic job of delivering the thrills and spills of the franchise proper in a portable-friendly form.

No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. 
Here’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.

Ahead of the release of classic compilation Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol1, Konami updated its website with a timeline of the featured games — However, dataminers gon' datamine, and folks prodded around the website might have unearthed the contents of a yet to be announced Volume 2.
According to the uncovered data, the Metal Gear Solid timeline pages features placeholder buttons for a selection of latter-day Metal Gear titles, namely 2008's Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, 2010 PlayStation Portable release Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and 2015's magnum opus, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, which would be the final title in the series to be helmed by creator Hideo Kojima.

Should these titles prove to be the lineup for Master Collection Vol.2, then this will be the very first time that Metal Gear Solid 4 has been made available on a platform outside of the PS3. Seeing this release, as well as the other titles, on Xbox, PC, and other platforms will certainly be a moment in MGS history, so here's hoping that this datamine proves to be accurate.
Back in the world of Actually Confirmed releases, fans are looking forward to Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1, which comprises Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, along with the original Metal Gear and Snake's Revenge, and a selection of rad additional content. It will launch October 24 on PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.

Diablo 4 has been out for a few weeks, and folks still haven't discovered a possible cow level for it. But weird stuff is popping up, old school Blizzard style.
According to several reports, including a full video from YouTuber AnActualSadTaco, there is a secret very brief hidden scene at the end of the credits, but it doesn't always pop up. Blizzard creature artist Jamir Blanco sounded off on the frenzy on Twitter, confirming the scene:
"Sounds like some people are finally starting to realize there’s a post-credit cutscene in our game...Not sure why some people aren’t seeing the post-credit shot..will find out for u guys."

Like, sure, you could attach the horror tag to it on Steam if you wanted, but it's more of a costume for you to enjoy - like the family down the street who are really into Halloween and turn their suburban semi into a haunted house with a movie-quality zombie in the front yard. It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.

Just don't expect it within six months. Or before 2024, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Ticket
It has been a very, very long time since we last heard anything from Bethesda's exciting new Indiana Jones title, but we have some new news straight from the horse's mouth — Though it might not be good news for everybody, with the reveal that the epic adventure will indeed be an Xbox/PC exclusive.
As reported by pundit Stephen Tolito, the revelation comes from no less than Bethesda Softworks own vice president, Pete Hines, who made the announcement during the preliminary questioning for the Microsoft vs. FTC lawsuit. According to Hines, Bethesda initially made a deal with IP owners Walt Disney to develop an Indiana Jones game for multiple platforms, but this was changed following Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda, mirroring the circumstances surrounding the recently released (and maligned) Redfall.
https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1671939745293688832?s=20
As we have reported on many an occasion, The FTC's lawsuit against Microsoft has been filed in order to argue against the latter's proposed $67 billion purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard. This long-running and increasingly cumbersome deal has had to climb over many hurdles and walls on its way to fruition, with the FTC lawsuit set to prove one of its largest obstacles. While preliminary hearings are underway, the case will go to U.S. courts in August, though both parties will have the right to appeal regardless of the result.
We can very likely expect to hear more behind-the-curtain tidbits before the summer is through.
The as-yet-unnamed Indiana Jones title is currently in development for Xbox and PC at MachineGames.

With the summer showcases winding down here, we've just had another summer without E3. And according to a new source, E3's potential return still seems very, very shaky.
As spotted on ResetEra, the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board held a regular meeting discussing tourism for the city. Among the slides in this presentation was one about convention sales, with a note mentioning "E3 cancellations for 2024 & 2025."
A previous report had indicated prospective dates for E3 2024 and 2025, but no actual dates or plans had been announced.

Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. 
Localization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. 
This news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. 
However, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.


Today's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited "reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity." 
"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you," Hines said, according to IGN.
Bethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today.

I’d say Final Fantasy XVI is finally out, but compared to previous series games, this one hardly felt like a wait. Still, I think I speak for everyone when I say that Creative Business Unit III’s take on the mainline series has drawn a lot of curiosity. Fortunately, the final product is as fantastic as I hoped it would be.
Final Fantasy XVI marks a bold new direction for the franchise. If you’re a fan of the previous turn-based entries, this game may feel downright alien at the start. Thankfully, Final Fantasy XVI takes many steps to help ease players into its mechanics. With time, you too can Precision Dodge into deadly counterattacks that trigger long, impressive combos.

However, it’s still a Final Fantasy, meaning there are dozens of hours of content to experience, from the main story to the side quests, hunts, and more.

Square Enix has announced that it will hold a special anniversary live stream next month to celebrate five years of the narrative adventure franchise Octopath Traveler. The stream will take place on July 13, the same date as the first title graced its presence on Nintendo Switch.
Developed by Square Enix and Acquire, the Octopath Traveler titles allow players to follow the interconnecting tales of a party of distinct protagonists, who cross paths under their own respective circumstances. Octopath Traveler and its recent sequel, Octopath Traveler II, have garnered devoted fanbases due to their traditional RPG nature, interesting characters, and artistically impressive worlds. The second title has sold over one million copies since its February launch on PC and consoles.

Produced in alignment with Weekly Famitsu, the live stream will feature guests such as Square Enix producer Masashi Takahashi, Acquire lead Keisuke Miyauchi, and series composer Yasunori Nishiki. The stream will include interviews, a retrospective, and the results of a recently held Japanese fan survey. As to whether we can expect any reveals... Well, a sequel literally arrived less than six months ago, so any new titles or spin-offs seem unlikely. But perhaps Square Enix will have something interesting to show fans.
The Octopath Traveler Anniversary Stream will take place July 13 at 20:00 JST, which is a red-eyed 04:00 in PT times. If there is any news, we will be sure to keep you abreast of it.
Octopath Traveler II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

In case you missed it, Pikmin 1 and 2 HD have been re-released on Switch. It was all done in the form of a surprise announcement in a June 2023 Nintendo Direct, as Nintendo tends to do! This is a great day for preservation, as you can pick up Pikmin 1-4 on Switch by the time the latest iteration arrives on July 21. The 3DS sequel/spinoff Hey! Pikmin remains on the outside, but who knows: Nintendo will probably get around to porting it one day.
Oh, and Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is out too, which our own CJ Andriessen enjoyed quite a bit. Between these two titles and a Super Meat Boy puzzle spinoff (Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine), it's an interesting week for the Nintendo eShop. Variety is the spice of life.

When you initially think of Call of Duty, the idea of fighting a nonstop horde of the undead probably isn't the first thing you'd think of. Well, at least until after the Zombies mode became a staple of the Call of Duty series, becoming as much a part of the franchise as its multiplayer and campaign modes.
Since its original inception in Call of Duty: World at War, many players have grown attached to Zombies, as it provides a fun four-player co-op excursion from the series' standard modes. However, with so many titles now including the mode, the amount of available maps has skyrocketed.
Here are 10 of them that remain the best the series has offered to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As well as a Hummer for all you fabulous gas-guzzlers*
It looks like two vehicles driven by the most famous doll in the world are preparing to hit the garages of dazzling arcade racer Forza Horizon 5 — The Corvette and Hummer driven by Margot Robbie in upcoming movie, Barbie, will be arriving in-game at some point in the near future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_RsVstmcls
The two vehicles were noted by Forza fan IdleSloth, who spotted placeholders in the game's Promo menu. The two cars featured are the "1956 Barbie Movie Corvette EV", (featured in the Chevrolet section), and the "2022 Barbie Movie Hummer EV Pickup", (featured under GMC). Videos of the vehicles in Showcase Mode were later uploaded by another Forza devotee, Aziial.
No dates for the drop have been announced, so it is assumed the two *electric vehicles will arrive as free downloads or in-game rewards to cross-promote the movie itself, which premieres July 21.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN7qCE4uI_s
Directed by Greta Gerwig, Barbie follows the adventures of the titular doll, as she and her long-time pal Ken (Ryan Gosling) leave Barbieland to visit the "real world" and get a taste of reality. A huge ensemble cast includes Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Michael Cera, America Ferrara, Issa Rae, and Helen Mirren. Response to recent trailers has been extremely positive, and all that's left is the waiting game before we find out with the talent both in front of and behind the lens can live up to the hype.
Forza Horizon 5 is available now on PC and Xbox platforms. Barbie premieres in U.S. theaters July 21.

Ah, Cyberpunk 2077. What a road you've been down. From one of the most disastrous launches in recent gaming history to an enjoyable dystopian RPG from the people that brought us The Witcher. CD Projekt Red has been doing what it can to make its open-world title the product it should have been at the start, and the latest update has been rolling out.
Patch 1.63 for Cyberpunk 2077 comes with a host of tweaks and fixes, as all good patches should. In this instance, particular attention has been paid to some of the game's quests. For example, there's been a fix for the "All Along the Watchtower" and "I Walk the Line" missions, in which V could randomly flat line.

There's also been some fixes for some of the side quests (known as "gigs"), including "Guinea Pigs," "Bloodsport," "On a Tight Leash," and more. The patch also puts a band-aid on some issues with the UI and makes improvements for DLSS Frame Generation, specifically for those running the game on AMD processors. The patch notes on Steam give a better idea of just how much has been fixed for version 1.63.
It's clear that Cyberpunk still has a few problems, but then what release doesn't these days? Hell, Skyrim is still one of the most popular RPGs of the last decade, and that title's so loaded with bugs that it's pretty much become a meme at this point.
Alongside these changes, many of you are anticipating Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC, which is set to release on September 26. There's also a follow-up that CD Projekt Red announced in 2022, but that's far off into the future. Hopefully, CDPR has learned a lot from Cyberpunk 2077's notorious launch before diving into sequel development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yay or neigh?
Cygames revealed Umamusume Pretty Derby: Nekketsu Hachamecha Dai Kasha-sai as part of Japan’s Nintendo Direct yesterday, but there was little indication of its release plans. The publisher has now confirmed that the game will be coming to North America as Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash.
The pixel art visuals are cute, but what grabbed my attention is the obvious nods to the Nekketsu/Kunio-Kun series. There are four events in this party Grand Prix: Hurtling Hurdles, Blazing Baskets, Dodgeball Demolition, and Gourmet Gauntlet. Alliterations are fun. Three of those events bear a resemblance to games in the Kunio-Kun series. In particular, the Blazing Baskets game has three nets stacked on top of each other, which was part of Nekketsu Street Basket.
https://youtu.be/M8SzQG-VLjU
Homage aside, it’s definitely not just a straight copy. There are a lot of new things mixed in with these games, like turning someone into a penguin for some reason. Collectibles of some sort are on the playing field. It looks like all events are a free-for-all. There actually isn’t a whole lot to go on in this press release, but I think the trailer speaks for itself.
We’re promised a “star-studded cast of Umamusume to play as.” I don’t know what that means beyond them being horse girls. I’m going to be honest with you, I know nothing about Umamusume. This is actually the first time I’ve heard of it. I do watch anime from time to time, but it’s part of a very sparse likelihood that I’ll watch a TV show at all. This trailer doesn’t really get me interested in the show, but the game looks fun.
Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash is coming to PS4, Switch, and PC sometime in 2024.

But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bethesda revealed that Starfield would have over 1,000 planets, it sounded both impressive and like a potential nightmare. What if instead of a dozen bespoke locations, the open world sci-fi RPG was scattered across hundreds of lifeless rocks filled with the same old stuff. Director Todd Howard suggests it’s…

In the run-up to Starfield, many of you will be anticipating the antics you can get up to in Bethesda's space-faring RPG. While it's unlikely that the game will let you "hang ten" (or whatever) while exploring alien worlds, you can still pull some moves with a skateboard themed on the game.
Over on the Bethesda website, if you wish to relive those glory days of the Tony Hawk games you can pick up an "aerial skate deck" while you wait for Starfield to come out. Featuring the logo and artwork inspired by the upcoming game, the item itself does not actually come with wheels. But don't worry. The site says you can still hang it on your wall.
[caption id="attachment_388074" align="aligncenter" width="450"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]
This is just one of many Starfield paraphernalia objects that you can buy (so long as it's in stock), such as a journal, "constellation" jacket, desk mat, and, of course, a mug. If you do want to pick up the skateboard deck, currently priced at $75, you will need to purchase the wheels and grip tape separately, unless you have some spare lying around.
Much of the gaming world is eagerly awaiting the arrival of Starfield. Originally set to release in November 2022, the date was pushed back to sometime in 2023 before a final launch date of September 6 was officially announced by Bethesda.
It represents something a little different for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout studio, so a lot of people are curious to see what Todd Howard and his team have been working on these past few years. Then, and only then, will the studio give news about the whereabouts of TES6. Maybe!

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn't have as good a ring to it (no one's going to be quoting "it's in the entertainment," any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.

[Update: While invites to the lucky parties invited to this week's "Stress Test" should have been received yesterday, NetherRealm Studios has konfirmed that the invites are delayed, and are to arrive later than expected.]
Life in the world of Mortal Kombat 1 sure moves fast — It was only a few weeks back that NetherRealm Studios revealed the latest release in the gory fighting franchise, and already we're entering the playable beta stages, with the game launching on PC and console platforms just three months from now.
And if the recent gameplay footage from Summer Game Fest whet your bloodthirsty appetite, you monster, then you could get the opportunity to play Mortal Kombat 1 for yourself next week, with the koming of a new "Online Stress Test", designed to put pressure on the new sequel-prequel's servers ahead of the launch period. The testing period will run from June 23-26 and will offer up one-on-one online action and limited Klassic Tower battles, obviously with something of an abridged roster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV175rgyH0k
If you want to throw your name in Kung Lao's razor hat, then head on over to the official website and register today. Interested parties will need a Warner Bros. gaming account, (you can register at the time if necessary), and the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test is only open to PS5 and Xbox Series X users in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Brazil. Lucky Kombatants will then receive access kodes to download the beta client at some point next week, ahead of the head-ripping khaos.
Mortal Kombat 1 launches September 14 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Our own Eric van Allen has already played a build of the exciting-looking scrapper, and you can read his thoughts right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Said to be 'horrified' by recent events
The news about the missing submersible, Titan, which disappeared during a visit to the wreck of the Titanic is on many people's minds and all over the media. Now, the story has reached the gaming world, as the indie horror title Iron Lung has seen its sales increase in the wake of the real-world incident.
According to developer David Szymanski over on Twitter (via PC Gamer) there's been a spike in the amount of units that have sold for the creepy, underwater game. Szymanski shows a graph that depicts a significant uptick in sales, right around the time the missing sub became huge news in global media. This would suggest that the story of the missing occupants onboard the submersible has inspired some to buy Iron Lung.
https://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1671498543771574273
For those who don't know, Iron Lung is a small horror game that tasks you with investigating mysterious goings-on underwater. You're placed inside a cramped, iron vessel that takes you to the depths of an alien ocean, with nothing but ominous sounds and grainy pictures to keep you company. It was actually one of our Top 10 pics of 2022.
However, the fact that people are now buying the game in the wake of the missing Titan could be seen as poor taste by some. In fact, the developer has said, in response to someone on Twitter, that they "feel kinda uncomfortable" about the rise in Iron Lung's popularity. One person made a comment about not being sure whether they'd be "honored or horrified" by what's been happening, though Szymanski says they are "pretty horrified."
At the time of writing, the Titan sub, which went missing on June 18, has still not been located. Additional search and rescue teams are still looking for the vessel as well as its five occupants.

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.

You can check out the full trailer for that when it debuts later today, but leaks regarding the expansion were shared on the Sims Community fan site after details and screenshots were mistakenly shared on Steam earlier this week.

However, it is possible to get used/refurbished models for much cheaper, including at GameStop where you can now pick up the full kit for just $599, a solid $400 off the usual price.

And one of the main reasons I enjoyed my 65+ hours with it was the combat. It’s fast-paced and bombastic and continues to grow more and more robust as you play through the game’s story. 
However, it can be difficult. As someone with dozens of hours in the game (and still playing more as I stretch into its endgame content) and a pretty good handle on FFXVI’s combat, I’m here to help with that! Here are 10 tips and tricks to help you dominate the battlefield in FFXVI.

The match was too close to call – 1990 to 1995 – but I wasn't keeping track. All that stood between my team and victory was a chubby crocodile with a vacuum. I danced and jumped around him as he used his big belly and Luigi's Mansion-like hoover to bounce me around like a loose piece of cat fluff. I just needed a few moments to deposit my Wumpa Fruit, and victory would be ours. I had my blinders on, and that was a mistake. The enemy team's Wumpa Fruit meter quickly filled to 2000, and the match was over. My…]]></summary>

The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

Given all the abject suffering that the game and its predecessors make their stock and trade, it was an especially nice surprise to see real, genuine positivity emerge out of the literal hellscape of Sanctuary.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it's worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

"Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child." Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.

Well, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various "effects" of a non-culinary nature.

Arriving on October 24, this package is headlined by its HD remasters of Metal Gear Solid (including the VR/Special missions), Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. However, it also includes Metal Gear (both the NES and MSX versions), Snake’s Revenge, and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is speeding closer to the end of its six waves of Booster Course Pass DLC, which is said to wrap up before the end of this year. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.
Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Second Story is getting an HD-2D overhaul that slaps the letter R at the end of the title, a nod to the fact that it’s a remake.
The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.
Star Ocean The Second Story R launches November 2 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.


The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.

More specifically, the Arkham Trilogy is due out this fall and promises to allow players to experience "the definitive versions of Rocksteady's Arkham Trilogy games." This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more. All three of these games have been available elsewhere for years but this trilogy marks the first time Switch players can play through all three games. 
Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal. However, the three games in this trilogy are still great, so it's still a good get for the Switch platform.]]></summary>

The company revealed this during today's Nintendo Direct, highlighting the unique ways players can use two Joy-Con (and body movement) to complete microgames. One example shows a player using Joy-Con to balance Mario sliding in Super Mario 64. There's also plenty of first-person Wario action as well, with one microgame showing Wario trying to break out of what appears to be a jail cell. 


As you'd expect, WarioWare: Move It features a very unique, albeit strange, art style. Plus, it features two-player local co-op and a special Party Mode that allows up to four players to play various microgames together.

"In this 3D platforming adventure, you’ll explore the bright and colorful world of Macaroon, and help Penny and Yo-Yo escape the clutches of the grouchy Emperor Eddie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is right around the corner, but that didn't stop Nintendo from flooding us with new information about the game during today's Nintendo Direct. From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.


The main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.
You'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.
Finally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.
If you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica was announced recently through the Xbox Games Showcase, but details on gameplay were limited. Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.
In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.
Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.
Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.
Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.]]></summary>

One interesting thing the Direct did reveal was that when Peach steps on a special pedestal, her outfit changes, going from her usual pink dress to a bright, light blue dress that seems to indicate she's powered up in some way. But the reveal ends there, with Nintendo promising more information at a later date. The last game to star Peach as the main character was 2005's Super Princess Peach for DS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last February, Game Freak revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had DLC in the works, but all we got to show for it was a few pieces of concept art and static images of new Pokémon. Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.


Titled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.
The first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.
While the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.
No specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy XVI is bombastic, indulgent, and extreme, breaking far beyond the limits of what I thought an action-oriented Final Fantasy could pull off. It represents a pivotal shift for the series, ditching any semblance of turn-based move selection, active-time battles, or anything else in its history in favor of a fast-paced, extravagant, combo-heavy combat system that continued to grow more robust throughout my 60-plus hour journey. 
There’s a linear action game in FFXVI, and it’s the highlight of the experience. But standard RPG tropes, mechanics, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that I love Dorfromantik. It opened my eyes to the world of tile-based puzzler strategy games, and I've looked out for similar ones ever since. Thankfully for me, there's been a fair few riffs on Dorformantik's formula recently - a focus on nature, a soothing soundtrack, and some good old puzzling. Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you'll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.

From what Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's Chief Product Officer, shared in an official blog post yesterday, it seems that it'll be on creators to label their experiences as mature, which "may contain more violence, blood, or crude humour" than usual experiences.
The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to "simulate and even go beyond what's possible in the real world". Bronstein also added that, "We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox," referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.
You can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.
As you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.
The recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.
For more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here. For some of our positive hands-on impressions of the game, head here.]]></summary>

But because it makes incredibly difficult, obtuse games, such as the Soulsborne titles, defined by their challenge and willingness to go against common game design philosophies. From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.
Early in June, we flew out to Tokyo, Japan, to visit From Software to be the first people in the world to see Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. While the AC series has been with From for its entire history as a game developer, …]]></summary>

This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

Initially revealed on stage during Sony's 2014 E3 press conference, Dead Island 2 had an infamously rocky road to release. What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development. Until it resurfaced in late 2022, a seeming sign that Dead Island 2 would see the light of day – which i…]]></summary>

June 20, 2023
While Nintendo's presence was typically a given back when E3 was still around, its relative silence over the last month left many to doubt whether or not there would be a summer showcase at all. The company's Twitter account has also been the source of a scattered handful of announcements lately, posting everything from new Joy-Con colors to a sequel to 1-2 Switch to a new trailer for Pikmin 4. Still, Nintendo has plenty to announce, whether it's something we expect (like Metroid Prime 4) or something entirely new.
We'll find out for ourselves at the livestream tomorrow.

I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

As spotted by TheGamer, fans who have got their hands on copies of the game early, such as YouTuber belmont gr, are reporting that the Game Gear games sound off, like there's some kind of echo effect.

I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's "filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to "really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One mistake I often see novice PC builders making is overspending on the motherboard. It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/06/19/hideo-kojima-wont-direct-the-death-stranding-movie-but-he-is-deeply-involved"/>
        <updated>2023-06-19T15:54:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.
Just to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.
June 18, 2023
Here, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be "deeply involved" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will "introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe," according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.
In addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:
Given the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.]]></summary>

It's been nearly 11 years since Edmund Mcmillen, known for Super Meat Boy and Binding Of Isaac, first announced that the mysterious cat breed 'em up would be Team Meat's next game. The cats wound up waiting outside while they worked on other things, but we now have a much more concrete idea of what the game is.
The developers have actually been posting extensive development updates since January, but McMillen also just recorded an adhoc TikTok video where he points his phone at his screen. Turns out Mewgenics is a turn-based strategy roguelike with wizard cats who can cut their paws while opening windows. Could be worth the wait!

One of the developers has just said that, as of course they would, but not just any dev: we're talking about Devil May Cry 5 design lead Ryota Suzuki, who's dubbed FF16's sword-slinging his "personal masterpiece".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. 
Watch on Twitch!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look at any image of heavy metal horror game The Axis Unseen and you’ll recognise an archetype: the stealth archer. For a certain sort of Elder Scrolls player, it’s the only way to travel through a fantasy open world - perma-crouched, bow stretched lazily across the lower third of the screen. And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.
“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one. I’m pretty sure what goes into these.”

Based on a French novel by Boris Vian, this tells a strange and surprisingly dark story about a famously handsome young himbo who gets caught up in a sinister plot in 1950s Los Angeles and has to adventure, talk, fight, and - horrors - reason his way to the truth. It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious players can get their hands on Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders for the first time via a closed alpha later this month. 
On June 29, the PvPvE extraction shooter will get its first test out in the wild, so to speak. You’ll have to sign up on Steam to participate in the alpha, and a new trailer provides some fresh (pre-alpha) gameplay clips. 


ARC Raiders made its big debut at The Game Awards in 2021 and was originally pitched as a co-op PvE experience about players working together to battle invading alien machines. It had been slated to launch last year before Embark delayed the game in order to focus on finishing up its other upcoming free-to-play team shooter, The Finals (which has a second playable beta running now until June 21). Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. 
Embark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Did 2020's summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It's probably a horror game set in space. Doesn't that look great? Now let's take a look at the first game by a new studio comprised of ex-Bioware devs.


Yep, that's right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I've commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.
The tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has announced Absurd Ventures, his new studio. 
Houser was Rockstar's vice president when he announced in 2020 that he was leaving the company behind franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. At the time of the announcement, Houser revealed that he had taken an extended break starting in the spring of 2019. His last day at Rockstar, which he co-founded with his brother Sam Houser in 1998, was March 11. 
Now, three years later, Houser has revealed Absurd Ventures. This studio is focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts."


It sounds quite ambitious and while Absurd Venture's official website features all kinds of visuals showcasing its style, there's nothing official in terms of projects announced at this time.

That's more than a week's worth of playing and the game's only been out for 10 days (or 15, if we're including early access).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game coming to Nintendo Switch Online is Fire Emblem. 
More specifically, Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance version of Fire Emblem, otherwise known as Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, is coming to its subscription service for all Expansion Pack subscribers next week on June 23. This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. 


A prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. 
Fire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week. While waiting for Fire Emblem to hit the library on June 23, read Game Informer's review of Fire Emblem Engage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory can be a fickle thing. For thirty-something Mimi, everything before her thirteenth birthday is a blank. What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.

        <updated>2023-06-15T16:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the year’s best (and most literal) surprises, Hi-Fi Rush, is getting a free update that keeps the beat going with the addition of new modes and content. 
The “Arcade Challenge! Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. 


The first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. 
This update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. 
Hi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can read our review of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure that describing Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors sounds like it’s betraying a terminal lack of imagination. But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. "It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.
And yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.

Still, we keep it light by focusing on the games we actually like the look of, from The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria to Starfield, Nova Roma to Dungeons of Hinterberg.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are old games that are plain too hard to get into now, even I have to concede. Ancient ruins of a house to be admired and contemplated, but not fit to live in. The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. 
It's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.
What I'm saying is: it's still worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dambuster Studios have offered up a rough roadmap of what we can expect from the pair of upcoming Dead Island 2 story expansions. The first of the two expansions, titled Haus, asks the question, "How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?" and answers that with "a techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore!". Sounds about right. This first expansion has quite a vague release window, expected to launch some time between October and December this year.

I'm exceedingly pumped for Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown - and so is Prince Of Persia creator, Jordan Mechner.

And in speaking to Mechner earlier this week about how he feels about The Lost Crown now, he tells me that "what I've seen so far of their modern 2D Metroidvania take on [Prince Of Persia] has got me excited and very eager to play."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much as I adored Theme Park, it's a bit of a weird game to have inspired so many descendants. The latest is Park Beyond, and for the most part it's exactly what you'd expect. Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.
That's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.

Remnant: From The Ashes entered the looter-shooter space in 2019, defining its core loop with procedurally-segmented levels and Dark Souls-inspired mechanics like a stamina-based dodge roll and limited-use health consumables. Remnant’s fresh take on the shooter genre attracted praise, including Game Informer’s review which states, “Strong systems and a satisfying gameplay loop give Remnant: From The Ashes a powerful foundation, even if the experience is mired by repetitive and uninteresting bosses and environments.“

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
