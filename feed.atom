No one expected a sequel 30+ years after the original, but then again, no one expected the 2021 remakes. We love it when Nintendo gets unpredictable. The marketing alone for Emio: The Smiling Man deserves a gold star. And, amazingly, the game was only announced weeks ago, and we're already sitting here playing it!

EA Sports has followed the staple formula with the series, and two separate editions are available. The Standard is cheaper, but the Ultimate Edition offers a lot more in-game items. This decision can be confusing, especially for those who are going to buy their first FC title. There's no upgrade option either, which means that you should be confident about your purchase.


Who should buy the EA FC 25 Standard Edition?


The Standard Edition is priced at $69.99 on current-gen systems, and it offers a few extra in-game items along with the base game. You don't get any early access either, and that means that you can only play on September 27. At first, it might s…]]></summary>

The game was officially unveiled at the Monster Taming Direct, an independently run showcase of upcoming monster-taming video games. Using a hexagonal grid-based system, you'll need to navigate your way through ten different, ever-changing biomes. Each path brings its own risks and rewards, and with new monsters to tame and seven characters to unlock, the procedurally generated battles will keep you coming back for more.

Legendary Nintendo designer Takaya Imamura is a favourite here at Nintendo Life. Having worked on Star Fox, F-Zero, and being the art director on The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, his credits are pretty impressive. And he's recently been reflecting on his time at Nintendo again, specifically, working under Shigeru Miyamoto.
In an interview with Games Radar at Gamescom, the artist — who is currently promoting the upcoming game based on his Omega 6 comic — said he was incredibly proud to " work under Shigeru Miyamoto-san for so long". Who wouldn't, after all? But it goes beyond just pride — there's also a huge level of respect there.

Nintendo has updated its Game Content Guidelines for Online Video & Image Sharing Platforms. The tweaks are generally quite small, though there are a couple of noteworthy additions including a new stance on fair game in multiplayer modes and an additional warning against breaking any of the guidelines (thanks, @OatmealDome).
Let's start with the note on multiplayer modes. Nintendo has added to the FAQ section, "What do you mean by content that is 'unlawful, infringing, or inappropriate'?", to now include "actions that may be considered to impair the gameplay experience in multiplayer modes, such as intentionally disrupting game progress".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starships in No Man’s Sky make it possible for players to travel to different star systems and also help players fly around freely on a planet and all points of interaction within the star system. There are several types of ships you may encounter in No Man’s Sky, with NPC pilots frequently visiting trading posts, and Space Stations.


Moreover, there are also categories for ships, signifying the quality of a ship. The starship classes, in the order of worst to best in No Man’s Sky, are C, B, A, and S class. The A and S class ships in No Man’s Sky are a bit more difficult to find, and each ship in the game has its own pros and cons as such as its hyperdrive range, manoeuvrability, combat strength, and inventory space.


Screenshot by Destructoid


This is why players often have many ships in the game, and quickly switch between them as per the requirement of the task at hand. If you are wondering how many ships you can have in No Man’s Sky, the answer is 12. You can have a total of 12 ships in No Man’s Sky.


Your starships are stored in your freighter, but the freighter can only house six ships at a time. However, players can summon any of the 12 ships that they own by using the quick menu.


To have more than 12 ships, players have no choice but to sell or trade their ships to make room for a new ship. If you run into an S-class ship, you can trade it for a lower-class ship to improve your fleet collection.

We’re still a little far out from Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but the lead-up to a new series entry is often more exciting than playing the game itself. A steady stream of new Pokémon are revealed alongside old favorites getting regional variants, leading to memes and fan artwork galore across your social media website of choice. The frenzy that surrounded Lechonk leading up to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is a great example of this: the memes were, for a time, much louder than the concerns that graphically and technically the Paldea adventure looked like hot Garbodor.

In these vast worlds, fighting slimes is a noble cause for which you're handsomely rewarded. 


While the game's name might make you think of a cheap knock-off Dragon Quest title, this Roblox game is far from it. In Slime Slaying Simulator, you're taught the basics and then are sent out into the world to kill slimes, earn new gear, and unlock new parts of the world so you can conquer the Slime Queen and many more monstrous enemies. You can even hatch friendly slimes to help tackle the bigger enemies and ensure the world is saved from a sticky, gooey end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky is a survival game with limitless potential, with vast planets to explore, new creatures and plant life to encounter, and every now and then, stumbling upon a beautiful planet. Anyone who has played No Man’s Sky would be familiar with the Galaxy Map, which allows you to travel to nearby star systems. One quick look at the Galaxy Map, and its seemingly endless supply of star systems can naturally make anyone wonder how many planets are in No Man’s Sky.


Well, there are more than 18 quintillion planets in No Man’s Sky. To be precise, No Man’s Sky has 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets. This is possible due to the use of procedural generation in No Man’s Sky. Each planet in the game is part of a star system, and each star system has 2-6 planets and moons. Many of the planets in No Man’s Sky do not have a moon, but every now and then, you will stumble upon planets with one or even two moons.

Planets in No Man’s Sky are unique due to the procedural generation at play, which creates different forms of flora, fauna, and also determines the weather, temperature, and other defining features of a planet. You could run into a planet on fire, or one covered with snow. Some planets in No Man’s Sky have consistent rain and storms, while there are also planets with calm weather, and sunsets worth staring at.


Moreover, each planet has its own set of resources that are possible to obtain. For example, if players are looking for Copper, they will not find it on all planets in the game. This is one of the primary driving forces behind the gameplay of No Man’s Sky, as players would have to explore new planets and star systems to find the resources they are looking for.

Nintendo brought the first publicly playable demo of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom to PAX West this weekend, and attendees were quick to spot one feature that is yet to be officially revealed.
As highlighted on Twitter by @Nintendeal, it seems Echoes of Wisdom will offer both 'Normal' and 'Hero' difficulty settings right from the beginning, catering the challenge of Zelda's upcoming adventure to your personal tastes.

Among these is a confirmation that, no, the action game won’t be implementing DRM software such as Denuvo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been negligent in our duty as watchkeepers of extreme sports games. Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in a funny and thematically appropriate way.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

What is the best transformation spell in Black Myth: Wukong?


The best transformation spell in Black Myth: Wukong is the Umbral Abyss. This is the Macaque Chief transformation you receive after completing Chapter 3 of the game.

The reason why this is the best is simply because of its incredible damage output. If you transform into this with maxed-out focus, you can hit your opponent with the initial slash and instantly use its Cold Heart spell.

40 teams arrived at the ALGS Split 2 Playoffs to compete across three days for a place in the Finals. Each one of those days began early and finished late, pushing every player to their limits. Finals day is by far the biggest challenge of all, though. Teams begin with no points and must play to earn points quickly so they can work towards a win and come out on top. Doing that requires immense concentration and stamina, and that's exactly what SSG has demonstrated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The read option in Madden 25 is undoubtedly one of the more advanced plays I have encountered in my journey, but mastering it can unlock different dynamics in the offense.


This particular offensive playbook isn't available for every team. Naturally, the playbook can fly under the radar (as you have to either use teams that have the option or customize your playbook). When used correctly, it lets you target a member in the opposition defense to make the most of your offense.


How to run Read Option in Madden 25


First, you need to select a team that has the playbook available (for simplicity's sake, I am avoiding a custom playbook). Here are the teams you can use.



Atlanta Falcons


Houston Texans


San Francisco 49ers


Seattle Seahawks


Tampa Bay Buccaneers



P.S. There could be more teams, and this list is based on Madden 24.


Image via Destructoid


Here's how you can run the play.



Hold down the RT, and notice your opposition's DE. This is very important (he will be indicated with R).


Press X/A to snap.


You can either choose to run with the ball with your QB or make a pass. If you want to pass the ball to your  RB, don't press anything. If you want the ball to be retained by your QB, keep the X/A button pressed. 



Here's a key tip to remember - always notice the DE's position. If he's down on his knees, it's almost certain that he's coming for the RB. In that case, you will want to keep the ball with your QB and take it to the outside. If the DE is holding back in a stand-up position, it's better to let the ball go to your RB. 


Like the Run-Play Option, the Read playbook depends on your prediction of the opposition's move. You make the post-snap decision based on how you expect a defender to react. As with any playbook, make sure to practice in the training mode to get more efficient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Football Manager 2024 is going to be free, thanks to Epic Games Store. This franchise has a history of distributing the game for free for years: FM22 for everyone, FM23 from Twitch Prime, and now from the Epic launcher. 


However, it does have a condition; you have one week to claim it from Epic Games Store starting on September 5, 2024. Outside of the one-week window, the game goes for $59.99 on Epic Games Store.






Check out these time zones so you can snag it early:



GMT: 4:00 PM


ET (Eastern Time): 12:00 PM


CET (Central European Time): 6:00 PM


PT (Pacific Time): 9:00 AM


AEDT (Australian Eastern Daylight Time): 2:00 AM (next day)


JST (Japan Standard Time): 1:00 AM (next day)


CST (China Standard Time): 12:00 AM (next day)


IST (Indian Standard Time): 9:30 PM


ART (Argentina Time): 1:00 PM


MSK (Moscow Time): 7:00 PM


KST (Korean Standard Time): 2:00 AM (next day)


SGT (Singapore Time): 12:00 AM (next day)


BRT (Brasília Time): 1:00 PM


NZDT (New Zealand Daylight Time): 4:00 AM (next day)



You'll be able to pick up the game within the Epic Games Store app after September 5 to claim Football Manager 2024 for free. New users will need to create an Epic account before claiming it. The deal won't be on other stores, either, so Steam devotees are out of luck. 


Once you claim it, you own it forever. Just keep in mind this only applies to the PC version.

At just $700, this weapon has devastating one-hit kill potential to the head and, in the right hands, can decimate an entire team in a single clip. When the economy is looking rough and a miracle is needed, players often lean on the Desert Eagle to bail them out.


Every weapon in Counter-Strike 2 has its own unique skins to collect, and the Desert Eagle is no exception. Landing a one-tap headshot on an enemy is satisfying enough with the Deagle, but doing it with a stylish skin just hits different.

GameStop in North America is quite the opposite of this, with plenty of Funko POP toys stalking the aisles, some games, and a lack of customers at most hours of the day (at least in my experience). GameStop Retro could be a difference maker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darth Vader is a fan favorite in the Star Wars universe, so it’s no surprise players are eager to know if the legendary Sith Lord makes an appearance in Star Wars Outlaws. 


The following article contains spoilers for Star Wars Outlaws, available now. 


Does Darth Vader have a Star Wars Outlaws cameo?


To answer that question, yes, Darth Vader is in the game, but he is not a major character, so you can see only two prominent cameos, which don’t last too long. If you want to know more about those cameos, here is a rundown of them.


Before diving any further, note that it contains spoilers, so read it only if you have no problem.


Darth Vader confronts Director Sliro Barsha

The first cameo kicks off with a surprise meeting between Director Sliro Barsha, the main antagonist, and Darth Vader. Vader’s clearly ticked off because Zerek Besh hasn’t managed to capture the Rebel Alliances, which only highlights Sliro’s failures. 


To make his point, Vader shatters a glass and threatens Barsha when he talks back. He then makes it clear that capturing the Rebel Alliances needs to be Barsha’s top priority.


Darth Vader shows up via a Holocomm

In the second cameo, Darth Vader shows up as a hologram to give Director Sliro Barsha a hard time about a security breach. He brushes off Sliro, saying the guy’s no longer useful to the Emperor. Vader also mentions that the Emperor has agreed to Jaylen Vrax’s terms. 


Jaylen, who’s Sliro’s brother, struck a deal to capture the Akivan Rebels and hand over some sensitive info. In exchange, Jaylen will get Zerek Besh and Sliro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Counter-Strike 2's FAMAS may not be the most popular rifle on the CT side, but at $2050, it provides a budget option for those who can't afford the M4A1-S or M4A4 when the game's economy is tight.


Despite its relative unpopularity among players, there are still a bunch of cool Counter-Strike 2 FAMAS skins for you to grab. Being forced to use the FAMAS isn't ideal, but it's certainly a lot more palatable when you've got something nice to look at the entire time.

Counter-Strike 2 FAMAS Skins Tier List


Counter-Strike 2 features a total of 34 skins for the FAMAS. This gives you plenty of options when picking up the next item for your inventory, and because they're not as in demand as other CS2 rifles, there's significant potential to pick up a bargain here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Tokyo Toy Show 2024, Disney Lorcana made its Japanese debut. The card game is set to be released in the region in January 2025 with a slimmed-down version of The First Chapter set, smaller and cheaper booster packs, and three starter decks to get new players started.


As translated and reported by Mushu Report, Disney Lorcana's The First Chapter set has been officially revealed. Ravensburger is working with Takara Tomy as its distributor for the game in Japan. If you've been a fan of Disney Lorcana since it was initially released, this launch may look a little wonky to you. While the products that help you leap into the core experience are unaltered, it's the pack-opening experience that's going to feel very different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roll tape.
Greetings, worms! Finally, for all you readers who are worms, scouring Nintendo Life for worm-related content, here’s a game that puts annelids front and centre. Wiggling onto Switch from solo dev Munted Finger, Can of Wormholes dares to open that proverbial can and launch squiggly bird food – if we may call you that – straight at a wonderful array of cross-dimensional puzzles. Worms everywhere can stand proud. Or at least just sort of lie proud.
The rules of the game are simple enough to get your minuscule worm brains around: on each stage, you, the worm protagonist, must wriggle into a worm-shaped slot. You move your head square-by-square on a grid and the rest of your body follows the path you take – much like when you eat through a flowerbed, aerating the soil. A critical tweak to proceedings is that, when reversing, your tail end always goes back in a straight line, not retracing the route it came by. Further mechanical additions include pills that can be eaten to grow longer, blocks to push, shapes to ingest, and more. The game even permits the sad discovery that slicing a worm in two does not, in fact, create two worms. (Not two living worms, anyway.)

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta"/>
        <updated>2024-08-31T22:05:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all the guns in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta, the Jackal PDW is the clear stand-out amongst the mix. Its versatility is unmatched, offering both smooth mobility and robust firepower. And with a few strategic adjustments, you can enhance its performance even further. We're here to show you how to create the best Jackal PDW loadout in Black Ops 6 beta, empowering you to dominate the battlefield.


What is the best build for the Jackal PDW in Black Ops 6 beta?


To create the best build for the Jackal PDW in Black Ops 6 beta, equip these attachments:



Magazine: Extended Mag II


Underbarrel: Ranger Foregrip


Rear Grip: Commando Grip


Stock: Balanced Stock


Fire Mods: 9MM Parabellum FMJ



Since SMGs are relatively compact in ammo capacity, equip the Extended Mag II to compensate for it. You'll get 50 bullets out of it without sacrificing too much mobility. Then, you can start upping the Jackal PDW's damage with the 9MM Parabellum FMJ Fire Mod. The Rapid Fire mod can be a good asset, too, but it can be challenging to handle with recoil control.

The rest of the attachments help out with handling and mobility, including the Ranger Foregrip's increase in Movement and Sprinting Speed. The Commando Grip also boosts Aim Down Sight Speed, making it easier to target multiple enemies. Last but not least is the Balanced Stock, which improves mobility altogether.


Combining these attachments produces one of the best Jackal PDW builds in Black Ops 6 beta, perfect for its small-scale maps. Plus, you can attach the Dexterity Perk to it to reduce motion while jumping, sliding, and diving. Together, they'll make you a mobility master, getting you one step closer to the beta's max level cap.

Throughout the game, players will explore an intense mystery adventure through haunting yet beautiful locations and peer through the eyes of famous inventor Nikolai Tesla. 


Games like House of Tesla are fantastic because they feature incredibly deep puzzles within puzzles that blow out the cobwebs and really get you thinking. Each screen features fantastic artwork that make up the environments you explore. What I love about these titles is how you pick up all manner of items and fill your inventory before finding even a single puzzle you can even contemplate being able to solve.

If you were to look at the Silent Hill HD Collection that Konami brashly put out back in 2012, you'd think that the subject of Silent Hill remasters was even more cursed than the town itself. As it turns out, the curse is bogus and the town is totally a special place worth visiting if the navigation is put in the right hands.


This remaster diligently makes all the enhancements you'd expect out of a proper HD treatment. There's HD support, HD textures, improved lighting, shadows, fog, but it takes things furth…]]></summary>

Indeed, characters like the Falcon, Sidewinder, and Red Hulk enjoyed comic notoriety long before their upcoming appearances in Brave New World. With that in mind and utilizing decades of comic knowledge, I have expertly selected the best comics to read in preparation for Red Hulk smashing his way into the MCU in Captain America: Brave New World.

After 30 years, he's moving on from the company to make games in a new environment. 


Itsuno made the announcement on Twitter. Fans are both absolutely devastated that he's leaving and excited for what the future holds. His post explains how he's not leaving the games industry but moving on to "start developing a new game in a new environment." His hope is to create games that are just as memorable, if not more so, than some of the titles he's worked on throughout his career. The last game that he directed and shipped at Capcom was the phenomenal Dragon's Dogma 2.

From the narrow streets of Florence and Venice in Assassin’s Creed II to the sprawling landscapes of Ancient Greece in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, the series has always impressed me with its outstanding attention to historical detail in world design. Sure, it's all a fiction. However, there's no denying that the best Assassin's Creed games feel like taking a trip back in time.


In this ranking, I’ll be discussing how well Ubisoft has adapted the time period and location of each Assassin’s Creed game to support open exploration, enjoyable gameplay, and historical immersion. This adaptation process is a key part of what makes the best Assassin's Creed games so great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist.

But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation.

The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber.

In parallel, the Vietnamese Government is organizing a promo tour in Hollywood.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While AMD Ryzen AI 300 series laptops have begun appearing with Zen 5 CPU cores, to date the launched laptops have revolved around having either the integrated Radeon 890M RDNA3.5 graphics and/or NVIDIA GeForce discrete graphics. For those wanting a Linux-friendly laptop with Radeon discrete graphics for more gaming and GPU/compute potential, that still leaves the still very powerful Zen 4 laptop options. Bavarian Linux PC vendor TUXEDO Computers recently launched the Sirius 16 Gen 2 as a nice workstation/gaming laptop featuring the Ryzen 7 8845HS with Radeon RX 7600M XT discrete graphics.]]></summary>

Jak uvádí Jaromír Talíř na blogu CZ.NIC: „Když se MojeID v roce 2015 poprvé začalo připravovat na využití jako oficiální identita pro občany České republiky a došlo k zapojení do pilotního projektu přeshraniční identifikace STORK, muselo se MojeID přeci jen naučit protokol SAML 2.0. V té době již také došlo ke standardizaci OpenID Connect a jak jste se mohli dočíst na našem blogu, MojeID se tak rychle stalo službou, ke které je možné se připojit libovolným z těchto protokolů. Protokol OpenID 2.0 nicméně má svoje nejlepší léta za sebou a proto padlo rozhodnutí jeho podporu ukončit.“]]></summary>

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The slugcat of Rain World is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a while since I last played World Of Warcraft, but that doesn't stop me from listening to the Elwynn Forest theme whenever I need to decompress. And as I understand it, WoW's latest expansion The War Within adds to a game that's largely unrecognisable from those vanilla days. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens every time. I'd quite like to see the new continent, the new class features, and the expanded Skyriding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning I left my torpid flat in search of coffee, sniffed the restive wind, noted with approval the gloom gathering beneath the trees, and thought: at last, summer is over. At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.
Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

Credulous fools attribute this to the existence of a "bank holiday" on Monday 26th, but true initiates like ourselves know the sobering truth: the Maw has eaten one of our weekdays. We have dispatched our finest gastronauts equipped with extremely long pairs of tweezers to retrieve the missing Monday from the Maw's bowels. We can only hope it hasn't been digested yet - imagine living in a world with a four-day working week? The horror. Anyway, here are this week's PC game releases of note.

With just four months left of 2024, a software supplier hasn't even been chosen yet. With the current system falling over, previously blocked domains and IP addresses are being unblocked to make room for new ones, something that the law has no provision for. Meanwhile, smart TV manufacturers will soon be asked to ban a VPN app from their sets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

I don't usually get to do these weekend features, but Ollie and James are busy working their magic (stripmining Black Myth: Wukong for guides and fleeing Gamescom), while Nic can't type complete words anymore without getting his hands eaten (see latest domestic update, below). I know that Ollie usually does a picture puzzle for you, but I am comparatively innocent in the ways of Photoshop and more importantly, very lazy - so lazy that I can't think of an elegant way to complete this paragraph, and will proceed immediately to stating: here's what we're all playing this weekend.

Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Age of Empires with dinosaurs" is, the developers of the Dinolords recently told me in a cramped Gamescom booth, a flattering description for their upcoming England vs. Vikingsaurus RTS. It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

It takes place in 14th century England, and tasks you with fending off the rampant zombie hordes of a populace who've succumbed to a mysterious case of reanimation. Perhaps the cause is that there's no Maccies or TK Maxx at the local Bull Ring yet.

So much so that I mentioned in my review how I’m well up for another run of its fifteen hour campaign. I’d already got a few missions into hard mode. There's no more starting mana points! It’s a real...pane.
Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today, old man James wagged a finger at us all sternly for not writing about Atomfall before. My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've yet to discover a SteamWorld game I don't like. Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed yet again, pushing the troubled RPG into the first half of 2025. Publishers Paradox Interactive and developers The Chinese Room say the delay will allow them to continue to polish the game, respond to feedback, and expand on its story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

Anyway, this is a long but no less meaningful segue to a game from the Far: Changing Tides and Lone Sails devs Okomotive that's just been announced at this year's Geoffcom show. It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our unlucky planet in Wasteland Waste Disposal has suffered not just one apocalypse but all of them. Turns out the "megapocalypse" was an unhealthy combination of "every worst-case apocalyptic scenario imaginable". Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please lock your Chocobos to attack position and set your Phoenix Downs to stun: Square Enix have released fresh details of Final Fantasy 16's PC port, which has now been dated for launch on 17th September. They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
