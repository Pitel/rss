Neon White is the latest game from Donut County creator Ben Esposito. He and the Angel Matrix team bill this level-based first-person shooter as "for freaks, by freaks". They're not wrong, either. Despite some rough narrative moments and occasional hiccups, Neon White is a blazing-fast shooter with style, precision, and a lot of dead demons.
Sinners, saints, and salvation. All of these potentially await in the heaven of Neon White. To reach the end, though, you'll have to learn to go really, really fast. And, as it so happens, Neon White is a pretty good tutor.

OlliOlli World was one of the biggest surprises for me this year. I respected the two previous games in the series, but I had bounced off both of them. I was afraid I was going to do the same with OlliOlli World, but now it stands as one of my favorite releases this year.
It’s great to have an excuse to revisit it and feel insecure about how rusty I’ve gotten. VOID Riders is the perfect excuse to do so. It’s a rather sizeable collection of levels and a whole heap of new customization items to unlock. A new mechanic has been slotted in for good measure, as well, giving your thumbs new reason to get confused and disappoint you.

Ben Esposito has become somewhat of a star in the indie game scene over the last decade. From his work on Giant Sparrow’s The Unfinished Swan and What Remains of Edith Finch, to his part in Arkane Kids’ bizarro titles like Sonic Dreams Collection, you’ve likely come across him somewhere.
However, Esposito is probably best known for 2018’s Donut County — a game about a raccoon who controls holes in the ground through a mobile app so that he can get a quadcopter. Donut County was a breath of fresh air with its great puzzles and fantastic writing; and while it was a tad short, it’s definitely Espositio’s best work to date… until now.

In 2021, while interviewing creator Ben Esposito about then-upcoming Neon White, he told me he wasn't trying to make a game appealing to everyone. He wanted Neon White to appeal to "really specific people."
Put another way, as Esposito said in one of the game's trailers, it's a game made for "freaks."
I guess that makes me a freak, then. Because Neon White is my favorite game I've played all year – by a large margin.
You assume the role of Neon White; a dead assassin pulled from Hell for a divine competition. Demons overrun Heaven, so the powers that be task White and a host of damned…]]></summary>

In case you've been wondering why there's been some Goldeneye 64 news this year, note that it's the 25th anniversary of the series (amid rumors that it could be coming back in some capacity). That's partially why it's getting a whole Goldeneye 64 documentary!
Directed by documentarian Drew Roller, it'll bring us through the journey of the game "developer in a farmhouse in Warwickshire by a small ragtag team of university graduates, most of whom had never worked on a game before." Based on the trailer, the doc will take a look at how Goldeneye 64 (among several other games), changed the way shooters were perceived on consoles. There's interviews with past developers afoot, as well as tons of classic late '90s footage sprinkled in to take some of us back: or give younger folks a frame of refence for the "Xtreme/Attitude" period of the industry.
If you're interested, you can find the site for the production team here, which is where it'll debut in digital format on June 27. Although the digital platforms differ by region, it's currently being sold on iTunes [Apple TV] for roughly $9.99 USD, and the film clocks in at one hour and 39 minutes.
It's starting to get to the point where a lot of these retro games are "ancient history," and can be looked at in the same way that old relics of the past (like Pong) were just 20 years ago. I've come to accept it!

In Digimon Survive, you control Takuma as he gets lost in a mysterious world full of unusual creatures — Digital Monsters. Takuma teams up with a bunch of others and befriends a handful of Digimon to survive in this fog-laden land.

It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn't know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

I remember literally having "jelly legs" after playing, such was my complete, unadulterated excitement at my two greatest loves of the time combining.

The energy of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, one of the biggest crazes of the '80s, has endured for 35 years. Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s initially dark comic creations — later given a kid-friendly refashioning — spearheaded Turtlemania: a toxic-waste fusion of martial arts and mutant teen reptiles that swept the globe. Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, their names cribbed from history’s most fabled Renaissance artists, characterised shirts, shorts, lunch boxes, and of course, video games.
Konami’s 1989 arcade release, a four-player scrolling beat-em-up engineered to bankrupt unwitting parents, was a dream come true for kids tall enough to reach its bulky, shelf-like control panel. It was hardly the fairest of games, but its sound effects, introduction sequence, and “Cowa-Cowa-Cowabunga!” coin-drop jingle have since matured into giddy nostalgia.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles carved its perfect niche in video games by way of the cooperative beat ‘em up. Titles like the 1989 arcade game and Turtles in Time let fans fulfill the fantasy of kicking shell alongside their friends, but it’s been a long time since our green heroes were the stars of a great video game. Shredder’s Revenge ends that drought, serving as a lovingly crafted homage to TMNT’s glory days that gives fans what they remember while sanding down most of the rough edges.

As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 18 through June 19
The powers that be have revealed that a shiny Clefairy Pokemon distribution event for Sword and Shield is happening soon, to celebrate the Asia Player's Cup. The news comes via Serebii.net, who discovered that the code will be shared on various Pokemon Facebook pages from June 18 through June 19.
Like most worldwide distribution events, this one will be a code that's provided by The Pokemon Company, which works for a limited time. You can get it via the last mainline entry (Sword and Shield), by going into the mystery gift section and entering it. Stay tuned for the actual code distribution on the weekend.
This particularly Clefairy, again, is shiny, and will come with an Eviolite held item, at level 50. Serebii.net states that the official documents notes that it'll have glacitate, rather than icy wind. Earlier this year in February, Clefairy was datamined for Pokemon Unite: which is still a possibility for the game. It would potentially make sense to do a shiny Clefairy Pokemon event with that in mind, though this is mainly being done to honor the 2021 Asia Player's Cup contestant.
With Pokemon Scarlet and Violet in the pipeline, it stands to reason that all these events will shift over there by the end of the year, as well.

Nintendo and Monolith Soft have shared another supporting character for their upcoming RPG Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Today it's the turn of Yuzuriha, an archer who lives in the forest.
In a video shared by @XenobladeJP on Twitter, Yuzuriha gets to show off her agility and her archery prowess by grinding and leaping off of a rail, firing arrows at Mio and Eunie that then explode. She's a Phantom Archer, an Attacker class, so will likely be teaming up with your party at some point.

Cloud Gardens places itself in the rapidly expanding game genre “chill”. It ticks the critical boxes: open-ended, low-pressure gameplay; wistful ambient music; and graphics in colours muted enough and pixels chunky enough not to overcommit to anything. This sort of thing can be a bit meandering, but Noio has installed some clever guide rails around its post-apocalyptic playground to keep it moving along at just the pace you want.
First, the main game comprises compact dioramas presented in sequence, each needing to be completed to move to the next. This keeps things tight, with no sprawling convolutions to get your head around. Second, the items you can place and seeds you can plant in these scenes are labelled and categorised and stored in your catalogue for future use. This is not a collectathon or compare-the-stats scenario – things just get collected as you encounter them, giving a suggestion of progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall kicked off the recent Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase with a brand new look at gameplay. Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. 
Following that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. 


“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.'"
Smith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. 
Of course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase.

In the wake of Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser being sentenced to three years in jail for his contribution to Team Xecuter's hacking efforts, the mastermind behind the whole operation remains seemingly defiant and unapologetic.
Max Louarn, alleged leader of Team Xecuter, has a long history with hacking and apparently sees himself as more of a rebel than the proven criminal others would rather label him as. He recently spoke with publication Le Monde from the city of Avignon on his exploits and played down his apparent criminal status, citing the amount of money that companies like Nintendo makes:

Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting's first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

The studio didn’t mention this during the showcase, but shortly after, the Bethesda Game Studios Twitter account revealed some new details about dialogue in Starfield and how your created character – the protagonist of the game – interacts with NPCs. In short, speaking to NPCs will happen in first-person, and your character will remain silent as they do not have a voice.
Yes, dialogue in @StarfieldGame is first person and your character does not have a voice. pic.twitter.com/A8384m6rGN
June 13, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the studio has cleared up some possible confusion around the created character we’ll all be playing in Starfield. This reveal has been praised by some and criticized by others. Some Bethesda fans prefer the studio’s RPGs where you remain silent, while others prefer their character to have a voice they can hear in-game. 
I’m cool with either. I hope Starfield’s dialogue is more akin to Fallout 3 than Fallout 4, though. In the former, you’d see essentially all of the dialogue your choice would result in, whereas in Fallout 4, your choices were more like mood options, giving just a general view of that choice’s dialogue. It took away some of my character’s agency, and I’m hoping Starfield restores that a bit. Only time will tell for now, though. 
Starfield will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2023.
For more, read Game Informer’s Starfield analysis after its recent gameplay showing, and then check out this story about Todd Howard confirming that Fallout 5 is the next game Bethesda Game Studios will develop after Elder Scrolls 6 (which is the next game the studio will release after Starfield).

However, in an interview with Game Informer around the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV, series creator Tetsuya Nomura, has revealed that it wasn't Disney that was particular about Sora's appearance in Nintendo's brawler, but rather himself!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Starlings are flying again
The tongue-in-cheek monster-mashing franchise Lollipop Chainsaw is apparently getting set to make its grand return, according to one former producer. The announcement was made on the campy title's 10th anniversary, as spotted by the eagle eyes of VGC.
"Lollipop Chainsaw is back by Dragami Games. Please look forward to it." The succinct statement popped up on Twitter late yesterday evening, penned by Yoshimi Yasuda, former CEO of developer Kadokawa Games. Yasuda did not offer any further explanation regarding this statement, not clarifying whether he was referring to a new sequel, a remaster, or a remake.
Regardless... it's... back!
https://twitter.com/yasudaD5/status/1536826749623095296?s=20&t=exrsr8Szb-M19kFX585--w
Originally released for PS3 and Xbox 360, Lollipop Chainsaw is a cheesecake hack 'n' slash adventure that follows a sultry cheerleader, Juliet Starling, who is forced to call upon her ancient zombie hunting bloodline to clear out an uprising of the dead within her Californian high-school. Accompanied by the sentient severed head of her boyfriend, Nick, Juliet gets a little saw crazy against an army of putrid monsters and demons, in overtly sexual, wantonly gory, splatteriffic action.
With eccentric game maker Suda51 on its directorial team, and a script penned by a pre-Guardians of the Galaxy James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw didn't win many awards for being a technical masterpiece, but became revered in the following years for its cathartic action and ridiculous and vulgar aesthetic. Juliet Starling will most certainly be welcomed back into the modern gaming era with open arms. As to when that will happen, where, and in what form. We'll have to wait on something a little more concrete.
Start revving, at any rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“In previous titles, we never really put a high emphasis on combat".
If you've seen the Sonic Frontiers trailers so far, you've probably noticed how the blue blur can now do a lot more attacks.
In a recent interview with IGN, Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto mentioned how Sonic Team this time implemented a much "more fleshed-out" combat system. Sonic Team supposedly never really "put a high emphasis on combat" in previous titles, according to Kishimoto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Turismo is a video game series entirely devoid of character. That’s not a criticism, just a fact: it wants to be a glossy car brochure, not tell a story, and it’s an approach that has served the games well over the decades. Now that Hollywood is making a Gran Turismo movie, though, that could have been a problem.

Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support. Not bad at all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ukrainian team is continuing development as the invasion continues
Today's Xbox Games Extended Showcase closed out with a sobering reminder of the current realities for GSC Game World. The Ukrainian studio has been public about the effect the Russian invasion has had on development. Today the team opened up about it, sharing an emotional update as it confirmed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is moving to 2023.
While the studio shared a new video about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 itself, which you can find here, GSC Game World also shared a dev diary about its current status. The three-minute video is powerful and a heavy watch, just so you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxcfxdG22pg
The video shows the toll that the invasion has taken on its developers and where they live. While some have been able to get out, others have not been able to, or opted to volunteer or even serve in the armed forces. The video shows developers living in small hallways, rushing for bomb shelters, and walking around in destroyed city blocks. One describes how he's unsure whether some of his loved ones are safe or not. It is a heavy reminder of the real toll the Russian invasion has taken on average people in Ukraine.
During the update, GSC Game World confirms that it has pushed the release of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl into 2023.
Development during wartime
The Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022 and has continued for 111 days. It's taken its toll on many Ukrainian citizens including those at GSC Game World and more, as detailed in a report from IGN in May. Many other developers and publishers have called for aid and action in response to the invasion, including withholding their games and services from Russia and Belarus.
Our hearts go out to the GSC Game World team. The studio has shared a link at which you can help provide aid.

The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you're willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That's a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

        <updated>2022-06-14T22:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a video interview with IGN, Bethesda’s Todd Howard divulged additional details about Starfield. He also uttered the name “Fallout 5” and gave an idea of when fans can expect to see it. 
Speaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 will be the next game after The Elder Scrolls 6, which itself has entered pre-production:
"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well."
Following up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield's main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. 
The game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. 
Starfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Even with minimal details, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty — a new Team Ninja romp coming in hot off the Nioh series — was probably my favorite game announcement at the jam-packed Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. It's an action-infused dark-fantasy take on the Three Kingdoms with demons to take out and a masocore challenge to overcome.
There are still a lot of gameplay specifics to fill in, but coming off of the weekend's big Xbox showing, we now know that the game is making the full rounds on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early 2023. Team Ninja also shared more information about Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty in an interview with IGN — and it sounds really promising.

My life has been an Alanis Morissette song as I've tried to get these summer stream tarot readings done. No, not that one. It's "Hand in My Pocket."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each time San Diego Comic-Con rolls around, we receive a ton of conference-exclusive collectibles to fawn over. While many of us will likely never get our hands on some of these unless we actually go to the show or find a vendor online, they're always fun to look at. This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.
This version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it's floating above its stand. While I haven't seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.

This San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a "2022 Summer Convention Exclusive" sticker or the "2022 San Diego Comic-Con" sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn't guaranteed. This year marks the iconic convention's grand return to the San Diego Convention Center for the first time since 2019. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 21 to July 24.]]></summary>

That mostly involved middle aged men in jeans talking through their marketing bulletpoints, but there were also a couple of new announcements in between. One of them was that co-op survival-me-do Valheim is heading to PC Game Pass this autumn.

A listing for Tactics Ogre: Reborn leaked out last night. A PlayStation Store listing not only had the name, but also a few pieces of art to go along with it.
Though the listing is down now, users were quick to catch the relevant info and art (thanks, Escapist) before it went away.
Sadly, there wasn't anything about pricing, release date, or details about the upcoming project. All we have is the above and below images, one bearing the name Tactics Ogre Reborn.

If we want to over-analyze a bit, the above image struck me a bit because it is pretty darn similar to the box art of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. You can see the box art below (via MobyGames) has two similar characters and stances in front of a flag. Reborn, however, is stylized closer to Akih…]]></summary>

Oskar Karlsson and his dad, Andreas, had tried to create the perfect controller before. Oskar, a young Swedish boy and the oldest of his siblings, wanted to play games with them and his dad. But Oskar found it difficult to use a controller because of his spinal muscular atrophy — a condition which causes extreme weakness and wasting of his muscles.
"I like playing games because you can do anything," said Oskar. His dad elaborated: "In the physical world, his body tells him what he can and cannot do, but in the game world there are no limits."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show's end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.


The Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.
The other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it's nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don't expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.
If you can't wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it's available to purchase right now on Steam.]]></summary>

So it is with Outpost, a first-person base-builder with seemingly massive swarms that impressed during the Future Games Show. How does it look in the 8 minutes of playtest footage below? Less impressive - but still compelling.

So all eyes are on Diablo 4, which is due out "in the next 12 months" according to a statement made during the Microsoft Xbox Conference this past weekend. Overwatch 2 hasn't fared so well in the public eye ever since it was revealed, and Diablo Immortal has been earning the ire of players all over the world. When coupled with Warcraft III: Reforged and all the other goings-on at Blizzard, the company has a clear image problem. Diablo 4 cosmetics likely won't fix that.
In any case, it hopes to solve those problems with Diablo 4, which is now seemingly the golden goose that will restore some of the company's reputation: at least in the eyes of some execs. But they're having a hard time selling it given, well, everything we just talked about above.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was put on hold when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game's development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.
Meanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's gloomy atmosphere.  


In addition, a developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia's invasion and how it banded together amidst days of bombings (contains disturbing imagry of the war so viewer discretion is advised).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're History
The world of River City Saga: Three Kingdoms is about to get a little more dangerous, as publisher Arc System Works and developer APlus Games have revealed that River City Girls' inimitable schoolgirl sluggers, Kyoko and Misako, will be making their presence felt in the upcoming historical brawler.
As we have previously reported, River City Saga: Three Kingdoms is a BARF-tastic take on the ancient Chinese fable of “Sangokushi,” perhaps better known to westerners as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The classic tale has been adapted to fit within the rock-'em, sock-'em Kunio-kun universe, complete with retro-inspired visuals, belt-scrolling brawler action, and a cast of familiar heroes and villains telling the tale of the fall of the Han Dynasty, albeit with far more groin kicks.

In addition to the story mode, River City Saga: Three Kingdoms will feature a multiplayer-centric side adventure, "Heroes of the Three Kingdoms: Battle of Red Cliffs". This is where our girls get to enter the fray, joining a roster of 24 Kunio-kun legends to battle through 10 stages of madcap action for one-to-four players. Both Kyoko and Misako have received something of a visual redesign in order to fit in with the period setting — and they both look just darling in the retro-contemporary duds.
Of course, this cameo appearance will get the pint-sized pugilists warmed up for their own incoming release, River City Girls 2, which is currently in development at WayForward with a tentative launch window of summer 2022. You can check out information on the sequel in our previous reports here and here.
River City Saga: Three Kingdoms launches July 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where is my camera?
One of the most compelling things a game can do in my eyes is have a clear artistic vision and go balls-to-the-wall in order to execute it. American Arcadia is one of those games. From the very first trailer I saw, I knew it was going to be one of those titles that delivers on aesthetic and concept, which can either be spectacular, or flop on its face. After playing a preview of American Arcadia for the Tribeca Games Fest, I have a feeling it will be leaning toward the former.
Sometimes a game can bite off more than it can chew with a bunch of different elements — more complexity isn't always better. There's certainly much more game than what I got to play of American Arcadia, but from what I did get to see, it looks like a really fun balance of different styles of art …]]></summary>

Announced during the extended Xbox Games Showcase this morning, Iron Gate and Coffee Stain are bringing Valheim to Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in spring 2023 with Game Pass support, and considering how successful this Viking survival game has been on the PC Early Access side of things, that's a fantastic get. Speaking of, development will continue on the PC version as "external teams" handle the Xbox console ports.
https://youtu.be/vPEGKJlE9LE
In addition to the Xbox port (the first half of 2023 is going to be hella busy for gaming, isn't it?), the companies also announced that Valheim will join the PC Game Pass library in fall 2022. The best part: all three versions of Valheim — Steam, Microsoft Store, and Xbox — will have cross-play support for co-op survival. You don't have to make new friends.
"The porting is being done by external teams, so the core team at Iron Gate is still focusing on the Mistlands," the studio tweeted. The new biome update will be more exploration-focused.
"None of this would be possible without the incredible teams at Piktiv and Fishlabs who are continuing to work tirelessly on the Microsoft Store and Xbox ports, enabling us to focus on the Mistlands update and our exciting journey through Early Access."
I wouldn't be surprised to see Valheim show up on PS4 and PS5 eventually — I'm expecting a sort of Deep Rock Galactic situation — but nothing to report yet. When it comes to still-in-development early access games, PlayStation fans can expect to wait.
It's been a while since we checked in, but Valheim has cleared 10 million sales on Steam.

Up to 16 players can grab a tray and get going in the online multiplayer mode, with cool tricks and combos to pull off and a character customiser to set yourself apart from the crowd — or you can just attempt to get the best time in the solo mode instead.

Leading into the Overwatch 2 "reveal event" on June 16, Blizzard let it out that the next phase of testing is just around the corner. Sign-ups and full details will be shared during the stream (which starts at 10:00 a.m. Pacific), but for now, we know that the Overwatch 2 beta will begin on June 28, and it'll include PC and console players this time around.
https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1536755605238697984
In terms of new content for this beta, an unnamed "new map" will join the rotation, and this will be players' first crack at Junker Queen, a long-time-coming Tank hero who appeared during Sunday's Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. If you missed it, Blizzard also confirmed that Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play and launch on October 4, 2022.
My big takeaway recently as a Support player? Moira's deteriorating arm! Did you spot it?
PC, PlayStation, and Xbox
While Overwatch 2 is coming to all consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch), it would somewhat unsurprisingly seem that this beta will be limited to PlayStation, Xbox, and Battle.net based on those logos in the announcement image.
So far, PvP has been front and center, but plenty of lapsed Overwatch players are holding out for something special with PvE to bring them back into the fold — I hope the June 16 event gives us some much-needed clarity on that front. My time with the previous Overwatch 2 PC beta was short and not that sweet, and Chris wasn't really feeling it either in his initial check-in. After some updates (I'm still laughing about Zenyatta's high-impact kick) and admissions that there's much more to be done, I feel like there is a way to eventually ignite widespread excitement for the sequel, but it's been pretty dicey so far.
According to the team, they've "only just scratched the surface." So let's hear it!

It sounds small, but it's a really nice change that streamlines multiple playthroughs. In short, you only need to find those items one time and they'll augment all future playthroughs: rather than go through the tediousness of doing them over and over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Post-nuclear Pittsburgh"
We're getting a new update for Fallout 76 this very week (today actually!), but Bethesda is already looking to September with a new look at The Pitt update.
As part of the Summer of Gaming festivities, we got some extra footage at the update, which is now confirmed for September.
Here's a quick story primer:
"For the first time since Fallout 3, players are invited to journey back to post-war Pittsburg - now a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict and awash with radiation. Expeditions: The Pitt introduces a new storyline centered around two warring factions: the blue-collar freedom fighters of the Union, and the power-hungry raider faction of the Fanatics."

So the entire thing will be tied to expeditions, the public event-adjacent mechanic that was the focus of the Test Your Metal update today. We'll also get more "tweaks and enhancements to the game," including a tease for "adjusted gear for brand-new [players]." In addition to adding more content for endgame folks (level 50 or higher is recommended for The Pitt), we're getting early game enhancements too. Seems smart!
Like every major free update for Fallout 76 this could invigorate lapsed players, but Bethesda seems to be putting extra effort into this one on that front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft held a special celebration stream in honor of Assassin's Creed's 15th Anniversary today and during it, the company announced a new game mode for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, when to expect the finale to Eivor's story, a free gaming weekend, and plenty more. It also included a blink-and-you'll-miss-it tease of when to expect to learn more about the future of the Assassin's Creed franchise. 
Below, we'll break down each of the announcements: 
Assassin's Creed Valhalla
Ubisoft has revealed that Valhalla will get another year of content – aptly named Year Two – and it will include returning festivals, Mastery Challenge Pack 2, an armory update, and new tombs to explore. 
Plus, sometime this summer, The Forgotten Saga will hit Valhalla. This is a new rogue-lite inspired game mode that tak…]]></summary>

It's time for an Assassin’s Creed anniversary recap! It's been 15 years since the series first debuted on Xbox 360 and PS3 with Altaïr in November 2007, and Ubisoft is celebrating a little early during the so-called Summer of Gaming with a stream.
Here's everything that happened during the nearly hour and a half anniversary celebration.

Valhalla is getting more free content and an eventual end to Eivor's story
More festivals, new mastery challenges (pack 2), extra tombs, and additional gear are coming to Valhalla as part of the "Year 2" content. The Forgotten Saga is a huge part of it, which is a new mode described as a "roguelite journey through Niffelheim." All of it will be free, and "the end of the year will have one last surprise:" a …]]></summary>

Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear creator and all-around eccentric game-making dude, has offered further clarification on his studio's relationship with industry giants PlayStation and Xbox, following on from his recent announcement that he will be working with the latter on an as-yet-unannounced new game.
Kojima made the initial announcement during Sunday's Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, where the auteur appeared in a pre-recorded video to reveal that he would be working with Xbox to make a challenging, "never-before-seen" title that will be at the cutting-edge of Xbox technology.
"It's a completely new game that no one has ever experienced or seen before," noted Kojima in the video. "I've waited very long for the day when I could finally start to create it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 14 at 12PM ET
These seem to be popular! In addition to a Final Fantasy VII stream this week from Square Enix, Ubisoft is holding an Assassins' Creed celebration stream today.
It'll kick off at 12PM ET right here, or you can watch it below. Here's the full description of what the Assassin's Creed stream entails:
"Assassin’s Creed is turning 15! Tune in to celebrate the 15th anniversary with a special look at the future of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, a look back at the franchise, and a tease of what’s to come this year. The Ubisoft News team will be showcasing Assassin’s Creed Origin’s new 60 FPS gameplay update alongside producer, Jose Araiza before taking a look at the news and updates regarding all the latest and upcoming Assassin’s Creed comics, graphic novels, Manga, and more in Assassin’s Creed Stories."

That's pretty descriptive! Whereas the Final Fantasy 7 stream tease is woefully vague, this one tells us everything we need to know. It seems like the bigger focuses are Valhalla, as well as Origins 60 FPS footage (for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S): which is part of the new June update for the game. Then some cross-media stuff.
Remember, we have a full list of upcoming summer streams here.

In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a "farmadventure", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a "survival game without survival"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

Do we know the roster of Street Fighter 6? It is increasingly looking like we do. While some characters, namely Ryu, Chun-Li, Jamie, Luke, Guile, and apparently "Kimberely" have all been essentially confirmed, the mighty leak that rolled out last week appeared to fill in the remaining roster slots, giving us a grand total of 22 super-strong, (and super-stylish) World Warriors.
While Capcom has not officially confirmed the contents of the leak, it did begrudgingly admit that Street Fighter fans had "seen more than they were supposed to", with the following Guile trailer — complete with denim onesie — more or less rubber stamps the leak as genuine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GoldenEye 007 redefined the shooter genre when it launched on Nintendo 64 in 1997. Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare's acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the influential FPS. 


The trailer, uploaded on IGN, features snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight. 
GoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back to the farm
Nintendo has been struggling to provide Switch Online perks to users for some time, but one such perk is occasional game trials: sparing preview versions of full games during certain windows. The next one will be a Stardew Valley Switch Online trial, limited to Australia, Europe, and Japan currently (NA is expected to get it at some point).
With my European and Japanese Switch accounts (they're helpful for reporting!), I was able to see the notification in the "news" sections at the bottom of the Switch UI. The trial will run from June 13 (12:00 JST) through June 19 (17:59 JST). Australia even has an eShop page up for it.
If you somehow haven't played Stardew Valley yet, now is the time, provided you're able to take part in the trial. It's tough to really put into words how magical this game is that hasn't already been said, but suffice to say a few hours with it should give you a clue as to whether or not you're going to be spending another 100 hours with it.
Also note that you should be able to take advantage of the extra My Nintendo mission points once the trial is live. As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward.
[Update: As expected, this Stardew Valley Switch Online trial offer was added to the North American region this week. It'll run from June 14 at 10AM PT until June 20 at 11:59PM PT. The game will also be 20% off during this time, and you can get 100 Platinum Points for participating in the trial.]

Bedecked in Gothic-Lolita fashions and wearing an equally heavy look of mischief, Enchantress might be the smallest and youngest competitor to enter the DNF Duel ring, but what she lacks in size she makes up for in frightening black magic abilities. An expert in the ways of voodoo and the dark arts, Enchantress is able to conjure up projectiles and other weaponry twice her size, while also holding her own in CQC thanks to her super cute broomstick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 Stay Human's roadmap revealed five years of planned DLC. A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update – 1.4.0 – drops today with the first "Chapter," bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure. 
So, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission. 
Of course, there's also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun – we're talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph. 
Like its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG. So, eager Pilgrims will have many opportunities to expand upon Aiden's already-harrowing journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.

For roughly the past week, Street Fighter fans were met with mass confusion as to whether or not Fei Long would return to the series. But it seems as if this saga has come to an end.
The whole affair began when Daniel Lindholm, a composer for the Street Fighter series, made a comment that Fei Long would never return to the franchise on a YouTube Q&A session (which is now defunct/taken down, but was logged by several outlets). Here's what they claimed:
"A character that I know we won't see at all — there's been a lot of discussion about it — I mentioned earlier a character I would like to rewrite the music for would be Fei Long. I do have other sources — not only Capcom, but friends of mine in the U.S., who are very close friends with the Lee…]]></summary>

In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious "powers", Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village. Players will guide Rose through a number of spooky locales, including what appears to be Castle Dimetrescu from the game's main campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Capcom announced Exoprimal, an action game devised by your six-year-old self where players jump into badass exosuit and then machine-gun roiling hordes of dinosaurs, Alice0 believed that you fought the big lizard-birds with the help of an AI. In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight's Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

Resident Evil has one of the most loyal fanbases out there, and those who love the series have been looking forward to playing their favorite games of the series on next-gen consoles. Earlier this year, Capcom announced that they'd be able to do just that, because they had free updates for Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 in the works for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

During today's Capcom Showcase as part of the summer news blitz, they let us know that actually, these updated versions are available instantly. That was a nice surprise! The Xbox update will even be available with Xbox Smart Delivery, making it even easier for players to update to the best version for their console.
As reported a few months ago, the updated versions mostly just give us nicer graphics for each of the titles. It's nice that a company would go out of their way to make sure their games look amazing, free of charge. Now go and download your free update!

First off is the return of the Jungle area from the second generation of Monster Hunter, which has been completely redone for Sunbreak. While the Jungle sounds like it would be strictly filled with trees and other foliage, it's situated on the coast and offers plenty of sandy beaches and ruins to explore.


As for new monsters to hunt, Sunbreak has a lot of exciting new targets to take on. Espinas makes its return from Monster Hunter Frontiers. As its name implies ("espinas" is Spanish for thorns), this creature is covered in sharp spines that wi…]]></summary>

Capcom is finally bringing some DLC to Resident Evil Village, and it's pretty hefty. The Resident Evil Village Winter's Expansion packs in more Mercs content, a story for Rose, and a whole lot more on Oct. 28, 2022.
The big ticket item here is Shadows of Rose, a new story set in the Village universe following Rosemary Winters. It seems to get pretty mind-twisting and creepy, but for those who dig the expanded world of Resident Evil, that's a pretty interesting set-up.
Shadows of Rose is set 16 years after the events of Resident Evil Village, and the story sees Rose entering the consciousness of the Megamycete. Here, she has to deal with her pasts and nightmares. And apparently also a very evil, Persona palace version of the Duke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDIenuQepo
If story isn't what you're looking for, there's also the addition of a third-person mode, making it feel a bit more like a classic Resident Evil game. This new vantage point offers a new outlook, and possibly a little more distance between you and all the hand-based injuries Ethan suffers in Village.
Towering mercenaries, oh my
The Mercenaries game mode is also adding three additional characters: Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and the towering Lady Dimitrescu. Yes, Lady D fans rejoice. She's finally playable. Plus, there are some new stages to add some new challenges.
The Resident Evil Village expansion comes either separate, for those who just need to pick up the additional content, or the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, which packs it all together.

The Winter's Expansion and Resident Evil Village Gold Edition are out on Oct. 28, 2022.

        <updated>2022-06-13T22:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.
Exoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.


Those mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.
Interestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.
Capcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.
Exoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/capcom-showcase/2022/06/13/heres-your-first-look-at-resident-evil-4-remake-gameplay"/>
        <updated>2022-06-13T22:34:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. 
Director Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president's daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don't go well. 


We then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. "We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original," Hirabayashi said during the presentation. "Of course, there will also be thrilling battles."
You'd be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. 
I'm more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would've loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn't in the cards today. Here's hoping we'll get a better look in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village made a surprise return during today's Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.


In this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she's struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that's where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.
Capcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.
Lastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.
If you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won't have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter's Expansion, which contains all three additions. Capcom is planning to release this content on October 28.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hereby announce a video that may be nothing
During today's Capcom Showcase live stream, director Hideaki Itsuno put in an appearance to relay a message about the popular fantasy RPG series Dragon's Dogma.
While no actual announcements were made, Itsuno noted that the series celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, and that Capcom has prepared a special video to celebrate Dragon's Dogma and its games, lore, anime, and community. The video will go live on Thursday, June 16, at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST. The video will be available on Capcom's social media channels such as YouTube and Twitter.
Now, it's understandable that this seemed like a potential tease, and that perhaps the upcoming Dragon's Dogma anniversary celebrations might be an opening to spotlight some new project related to the series — the hungry fanbase would surely love such an exciting development. But it might be better for your health to temper those expectations and just enjoy the video without too high a hope. You would think that if Capcom did have a remake, remaster, sequel, or some other new title to announce, then they might have done it during tonight's stream, or perhaps at last week's Summer Game Fest.
So, just, keep yo'self in check... FOR NOW... (but really, don't get your hopes up.)

My fingers would ache for hours after playing Diablo Immortal; my hands haven’t spent this much time curled around my phone this way in years. Despite the pain my aging hands suffered during my first few days with Immortal, it was worth it for the fun I had. The series’ core action/RPG smash and loot gameplay makes the transition wonderfully to mobile thanks to responsive controls designed for portable play and adherence to the sights and sounds of the franchise. With this mobile facelift comes a free-to-play model most can avoid spend…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/13/psa-new-playstation-plus-tiers-available-today-upgrading-converts-to-yearly-plan"/>
        <updated>2022-06-13T16:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here's everything you'll need to know about upgrading your plan.
Three tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. 
Upgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you'll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don't panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. 
How To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly
There are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts > Accounts > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions. In there, you'll find your PS+ subscription. Once you've entered your subscription details, you can change your plan. 
Selecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you'd like to pay for on a recurring basis. 
Once you've locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you're ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you're not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abib the troubadour killed an ancient evil spirit by throwing his knife at it. Tinyfolks is not a "story generator" sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.


There's no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn't matter that you're a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you'll have a great time doing it.

It’s the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it’s also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is the next big new game from Bethesda Game Studios, and it's a pretty big deal because they haven't made something that isn't a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game in like... ever. So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

Nivalis is a slice-of-life sim set in the same cyberpunk city as hovercar courier game Cloudpunk, where we'll get to run bars and restaurants, grow ingredients, fish, make friends, and maybe even find love.

Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An unexpected and fun surprise from the PC Gaming Show was the reveal of Klei Entertainment's newest game. Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.


Thanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.
In typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.
The trailer gave an early access date of "202?" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.]]></summary>

All that is going to change when Season Seven of the MMO pirate 'em up arrives next month, as confirmed in a jaunty song at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase.

The very concept of Metal: Hellsinger appeals to me from the first note: Slay demons in a modern Doom-style first-person shooter to the beat of newly recorded tracks from some big names in rock and metal. As someone who grew up playing the original Doom and loves the modern iterations of the franchise, and has perhaps sunk more time into the Rock Band series than any other franchise, The Outsiders' upcoming game checks a lot of boxes. Still, coming into my hands-on time with the game, I was skeptical. Thankfully, the short demo I played at Summer Game Fest (which is also a…]]></summary>

You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.


This new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game's visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.
System Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, is making something new and a bit more surreal. The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.


 
Jan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they'll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters' ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.
During the presentation, 11 Bit Studios' Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a "classic sci-fi" story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It's designed for players to create their own stories.
 

It seems like it's far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PC Gaming Show debuted an extended look at gameplay for a Sci-fi thriller from Starward Industries, The Invincible. What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.


The demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it's been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.
I'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It must be a relief to ActiBlizz to have some good Diablo 4 news, given how everyone on Earth is ragging on Diablo Immortal 24/8 (when we are not open-mouthed at the stream of terrible news about the company, from numerous allegations of harrassment, misconduct and discrimination, to the company advising shareholders to not approve a proposal to report on harassment and discrimination). But at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase tonight they were able to share that Diablo 4 is coming out next year for some much anticipated ARPG antics. Why, that's the Diablo game people keep saying they want!
Plus, the Necromancer is confirmed as the fifth playable class. There's a moody trailer that tries to make being a Necromancer sound twisted and dangerous and a hard path to walk, but it mostly makes it sound like Necromancers are cool badasses with loads of skeleton best friends.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2022/06/12/obsidian-reveals-pentiment-a-beautiful-narrative-journey-through"/>
        <updated>2022-06-12T19:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind 2019’s The Outer Worlds, has revealed Pentiment, a beautiful narrative journey through 16th Century Bavaria. It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: 
“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” 
Pentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama where you make choices that impact the characters' lives, made an appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer, which was captured in-game, not only looked intriguing but also revealed the game's launch date. And it's next month!
On July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of "betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience." The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you'll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, "Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing." The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.
The multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it's unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process. 
Guess we'll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game creator Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions joined the Xbox Games Showcase presentation today for a quick but impactful announcement; he and his team are working on a new project in partnership with Xbox.
Unfortunately, he chose to share next to nothing about what the project will be, beyond sharing that it is a “game I have always wanted to make.”
Kojima also implied that it’s a new game, and thus likely not part of any existing franchise. He also spoke briefly about Microsoft’s cloud technology, suggesting that the project might leverage that capability as well.
It’s not much to go on, but it’s an interesting new direction for the studio and auteur, as Kojima has more recently been connected to Sony and its PlayStation brand.
It will be especially interesting to see what shape this new project will take as we learn more, but that may be quite a long way off from now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Xbox Games Showcase featured many games – big and small – by a glut of different development teams. Baby Robot Games is a Barcelona-based studio that focuses on supernatural stealth and adventure games. Today, it revealed Ereban: Shadow Legacy, a game where you must harness mystical shadow powers and use high-tech gadgets to uncover the truth about your past to save the universe.
In the trailer, the main character, Ayana, who channels some serious Tron energy with her attire, confronts big mechs. Apparently, Ayana is the last descent of a forgotten race and is key to saving this dying, morally grey universe. The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab them through the head, so that's pretty cool. She even takes some big falls from huge heights, reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. Watch the trailer above to get the full scoop.
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. No release date was revealed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has a history of showing off some of our favorite indies during its big showcases, and it looks like it's keeping that tradition alive and well. During the platform's Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.
Cocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players "on an adventure across worlds within worlds," which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.


 There's not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game's Steam page goes into a little more detail. 
Cocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer's description indicates fans should get ready to "master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery."]]></summary>

The necromancer joins the previously announced barbarian, sorceress, rogue, and druid, all allowing for high levels of customization.
As you dive into dangerous open areas, you'll be hunting the disciples of Lilith, the daughter of hatred. In new gameplay footage, developer Blizzard Entertainment says Diablo IV offers over 150 dungeons, along with territories to reclaim, and story sequences that occur as you explore. Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.


Diablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see. Along with the high number of dungeons, Blizzard claims the endgame is deep and will continue to expand years after release.
Blizzard says they are close to completing development, but has only given an open 2023 timeframe for release.]]></summary>

Revealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks quite similar to Team Ninja’s Nioh series in that it features a ninja-like character fighting against not just humans, but monstrous and demonic monsters, too. The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.


As you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: 
It looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.

        <updated>2022-06-12T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.
Drawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.
The new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.
Ebb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.
The developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.
While the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.
Scorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.]]></summary>

"Lightyear Frontier is a peaceful open-world farming adventure on a planet at the far edge of the galaxy. Start your new home on a distant planet with up to three friends as you farm alien crops, build your own homestead, and explore the untamed wilderness of the world."

Lightyear Frontier will be released into Early Access next spring on Xbox consoles and PC. According to the trailer, it's a console launch exclusive.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was on the cards, and tonight at the XBox & Bethesda Showcase we indeed got a look at some vampire slaying in Redfall. Arkane's spooky co-op FPS has been on my most anticipated list for a while, especially because I was hoping the studio would put their signature weird twist on things. Judging by the big guns and big abilities you have at your disposal, they have - and the vampires should be watching their be-caped backs. Never thought I'd see the day when someone made being a vampire hunter look cooler than being a vamp, but we might be getting there.

        <updated>2022-06-12T17:47:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[6/12 UPDATE: 
As we previously reported below, a leak heavily hinted that Forza Horizon 5's first expansion would be a Hot Wheels crossover. Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we've come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. 
PREVIOUS STORY
According to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. 
This wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. 
Forza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: 
“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”
Are you excited about the alleged crossover?

When it hits Early Access, Overwatch 2's PvP content will be free-to-play, giving players who want to play matches with or against friends the chance to do so at no cost. It'll also have a new character called The Junker Queen who got her own cinematic trailer, introducing her Mad-Max-meets-punk-rock persona in a handicap match against some nasty-looking fellas. The Junker Queen uses an ax and shotgun to tear through other heroes on the OW battlefield. We'll learn more about her on June 16, when Blizzard holds an Overwatch 2 reveal event.
Blizzard promises regular content updates for Overwatch 2, including new maps, modes, heroes, and even more. Also, because this showed up on the Xbox showcase doesn't mean the information above isn't any less true for the other platforms OW2 is planned to launch on. Overwatch 2 will hit Early Access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC at the same time.]]></summary>

In many sequences, we see Nor and Enki in the middle of vast battlefields, using a variety of weapons and magics to dispose of any soldier or beast that stands in their way. The footage is impressive, both in scale and the level of detail in the worlds. Nor and Enki appear to have swift aerial traversal means to get across terrain quickly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pete Hines took the stage at today's Xbox Showcase to introduce a bevy of Bethesda projects. Among looks at Elder Scrolls Online and a recap on Redfall, which kicked the event off in style, the Bethesda exec revealed a new expansion for Fallout 76. The company's online multiplayer game had a rough start, but Bethesda has continued to work on its title, with several story expansions and updates to the game's world. However, this is the first update we've had for the title in a while, as the last major expansion came last year.
The Pitt's story will take place in post-war Pittsburgh, a location we haven't seen since Fallout 3. Described as "a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict," players will be teaming up with the Union, a band of mechanically skilled fighters seeking to rid their home of raiders that have taken over called the Fanatics. This task will be made even harder by the fact that The Pitt's toxic wasteland is warping the mind of its inhabitants. 


Fallout 76's Expeditions: The Pitt is coming this September.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Mojang have revealed Minecraft Legends, an action strategy game coming to Xbox consoles and PC. 
This news comes from today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, where Mojang revealed the Legends trailer. The story shows the destruction of a village and the rebirth of a new land thanks to some heroic deeds of friendship, bravery, and more. According to the trailer, the game tells the story of a united overworld, and that overworld is to be united by none other than you, the player. 
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Legends is quite the departure from the typical Minecraft formula. Breaking away from the survival crafting mold the series has held for over a decade, similar to what Minecraft Dungeons did in 2020, Legends will be the first action strategy game in Mojang’s blocky world. It also features a unique spin on the traditional Minecraft visuals.
It retains the blockiness fans of Minecraft have come to know and love, but with a more distinct, almost comic book-ey style. It looks great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. 
While waiting for Minecraft Legends, read Game Informer’s Minecraft Dungeons review.

In a new trailer for Asobo Studio's A Plague Tale: Requiem, we see them traveling south, across treacherous terrain and into thriving villages. These places look like they could be safe havens, but we quickly see guards expanding their search and are everywhere.
The new footage shows stealth maneuvers captured in striking detail. We see Amicia hiding under a table to evade a patrol and being surprisingly aggressive, using weapons to silently take out guards. We also see her use fire to create a blaze that will surely draw out every guard in the area.
Of course, Hugo's curse doesn't remain dormant for long and a flood of rats appears to keep him safe. A Plague Tale: Requiem still doesn't have an official release date, but is still slated to release in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

        <updated>2022-06-12T17:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early in today’s Xbox Game Showcase, Riot Games’ president, Marc Merrill, took a few minutes to announce a big new partnership with Xbox and its Game Pass program. A number of Riot’s biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.
First, Riot’s flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.
In League of Legends: Wild Rift, it’s a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.
In Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that’s the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.
In Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.
And in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.
It’s a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox’s benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.
While Riot’s expansion into Game Pass is big news, it’s worth noting that it won’t have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.
The availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Homeworld 3, threequel to the OG melancholy spaceship strategy series, has been delayed into the first half of next year. The developers say they need more time to make the engine trails glow just right, and to make the derelict megastructures mega enough. We will apparently see more of the game in action this August, though.

Check out the trailer if you missed it on Thursday, it’s quite charming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year a couple of brothers posted a concept trailer for an FPS horror game that didn't exist (named Project Ill). Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I've not got much to point you towards - there's no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

If you've seen Palworld's previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show.

Watch the trailer, you'll see.

Milo must then have to navigate the abandoned world with a Pikmin-like army of aliens by his side, ready to solve puzzles. 

It looks great, and after being announced last year, Tinykin now has a release date of August 30th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's anything I've learned from today's Future Of Play event, it's that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it's at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an "Indigenous cybernoir detective game" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe "in the works" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.
The trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with "crime, conflict, and propaganda". Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.

The 2010 horror game about an oddball FBI agent investigating ritual murders in small-town America is not "so bad it's good", it's so good it doesn't matter that it's bad (and maybe the badness even amplifies the good). Well, I've been playing Deadly Premonition 2 ahead of its PC release today, and I'm sorry to say the sequel does not shake out the same way. Despite some bright spots, enough of Deadly Premonition 2 is bad that I've given up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most intriguing new announcements at today's Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you'll be on the right lines.
The trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma's whole retro futuristic vibe. It's got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the '90s, which of course means that it's much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Successful lawsuits filed by several Israel-based media companies against three pirate streaming sites are proving tricky to wrap up. A US court previously issued orders for all ISPs to block the sites and instructed third-party service providers to cease doing business with them. The plaintiffs say that since Cloudflare is refusing to comply, the company should be held in contempt of court.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
