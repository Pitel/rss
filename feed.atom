The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is just around the corner and, as seems to be the norm for big Nintendo titles, we've been treated to a rather comprehensive 'Ask the Developer' interview with the team behind the latest title.
One of the key points raised during the interview is that Echoes of Wisdom was actually built around the idea of 'being mischievous'. In fact, the team even created a document to explain what the concept meant, so if anybody wasn't sure on how to proceed, they could refer back to it at a pinch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony revealed on the PlayStation Blog that the next PlayStation State of Play is set for tomorrow, September 24, at 6 pm EST. The presentation will be streamed on both YouTube and Twitch and will feature more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR 2 titles from studios all over the world.


The last State of Play occurred in May of this year and focused primarily on the ill-fated Concord, taking up over 10 minutes of the roughly half-hour presentation. As for what to expect with this State of Play, Sony hasn't confirmed anything specific but has mentioned over 20 titles will be front and center. It's highly likely we'll see Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered officially announced, and there have been rumors of other PlayStation title remasters in the works.


Surely any remastered announcements will attempt to show off the newly announced PlayStation 5 Pro, and I imagine we'll see a 'Enhanced for PS5 Pro' or similar moniker after most of the reveals. You know, marketing stuff.


However, it's always possible that Sony has kept a top-secret new IP or popular IP game announcement that hasn't leaked yet. It feels like as good a time of ever for Sony to have an ace up their sleeve, after all.


But if the State of Play is bound to be packed full of remasters, wake me up when Bloodborne Remastered drops.


The upcoming PlayStation State of Play starts at 6 pm EST tomorrow, September 24, and will be live on both YouTube and Twitch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the mid-tier resources players can encounter in LEGO Fortnite, very few are more vital than Obsidian. The material is a requirement for building must-haves like the Metal Smelter, Epic Pickaxe, Oven, and a few other handy items. 


But as the material can only be found in very specific locations, getting your hands on it can prove to be a challenge. To help you with that, here's how to get Obsidian in LEGO Fortnite. 


Where to find and how to get Obsidian in LEGO Fortnite


You can get Obsidian in LEGO Fortnite by mainly mining it from Lava Caves, which can be spotted exclusively across the Dry Lands biome. Once inside any of the caves, you will be able to easily spot the obsidian rocks by their deep purple color and mine them by using a Rare or above Pickaxe. If you have yet to get the item, the Rare Pickaxe can be crafted by expending three Flexwood Rods and three Sand Claws.

Make sure to keep in mind that the lava caves are extremely hot environments that will slowly drain your health even while carrying multiple Cool-Headed Charms. To minimize that and get an extra layer of protection, I highly recommend that you also bring a few Snowberries and Snowberry Shakes for the expedition. You can check out how to make both the heat-resisting charm and the shake below:



Cool-Headed Charm (Uncommon): By expending 3x Silk Thread, 1x Marble, and 3x Sand Shells.


Snowberry Shake: By expending 2x Snowberry and 1x Milk. Can only be made with a Juicer. You can find Snowberries in bushes all around the Frostlands and get Milk by petting cows.  



Now that you know how to get Obsidian, don't forget to also check out how to craft a Musket, a Flintlock Pistol, and a Cannon in LEGO Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released an interview with The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom staff Eiji Aonuma, Tomomi Sano, Satoshi Terada that gives some behind-the-scenes background to the development of the game. Among the tidbits of information is the fact that the game once took a very different form.


Specifically, Echoes of Wisdom began with a “Game with dungeon creation in mind,” according to Aonuma. However, from there, it quickly changed to an “edit dungeon” format. In this concept, Link could change the perspective or move objects to “edit” the dungeon and solve puzzles. A lot of this still made it into the final version in the form of the eponymous echoes that Zelda can create. 


However, from the sound of things, Grezzo was aiming for something closer to the “Zelda Maker” concept, but it was dropped for the “edit dungeon” format, which was then scaled back to the game it is now. In particular, this quote from Sano really sums up the evolution:



“Of course, creating dungeons was fun, but being able to copy various objects and use them in different places was even more fun.”
Tomomi Sano



I could get behind a Zelda dungeon maker. In fact, it would probably be good for me; expanding the way I think about the series’ design in the same way that Mario Maker did. I think it’s possible that Nintendo will do it one day, even if the current attempt at this mutated into Echoes of Wisdom. There is certainly enough demand for the concept.


The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is out on September 26, 2024 for Switch. You can read the full interview over here on Nintendo’s site.

However, there's been a bit of contention regarding the publisher's insistence that players need a PSN account, even if they don't have the console version. Or even the console itself.


Still, trust the modding community to come to the rescue. As spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user iArtorias released an unofficial tool for the game that allows PC users to boot up Ragnarök without having to sign up for a PlayStation Network account.




The modder says the download is a "tiny library that fully strips the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement," after some players encountered problems with the port of the game. They do make it clear that the mod is not intended to encourage…]]></summary>

To complete the Six Of The Best SBC, you have to exchange a squad with exactly six nationalities.


Task 1 – Six Of The Best



Exact Nationalities in Squad: 6

After completing the SBC, you get an untradeable Prime Gold Players Pack which guarantees you a Gold Player rated 82 or higher, six Rare Gold players, and 12 Gold Player items. The Around The World challenge comes right after this.

With so many excellent platformers available on Switch, picking something out from the overwhelming selection can be hard. The genre has a very strong pedigree on Nintendo systems going all the way back to the original Super Mario Bros. on NES (which you can find on Switch along with several of its celebrated sequels via the Nintendo Switch Online NES and Super NES games).

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was just earlier this month that Private Division announced a delay for Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, pushing it to early 2025. It didn't take long for them to follow up, and now the chill, hairy-footed sim is due out on March 25, 2025. 


The official accounts shared a trailer along with the new release date. The folks at developer Weta Workshop open this one with a booming proclamation that "Tales of the Shire is a Lord of the Rings gaming experience like nothing that's come before." A much quieter voice follows suit, briefly touching upon how the team used their years of experience with Tolkien's work to make something that draws a lot from said source material. 


"Most importantly, it's a game about living as a Hobbit," they add. Judging from the release date trailer, it's got a solid aim on that very specific niche. 




For Tolkien nerds, the significance of March 25 probably doesn't need to be explained. But for everyone else: following a journey of 11 months, one week, and six days, the One Ring and Sauron were ultimately destroyed on March 25 of Third Age 3019. 


If that little trailer peeking into the world of the Hobbits isn't enough for you, the game's YouTube channel also celebrated Hobbit Day in style. A special Hobbit Day stream went live on September 22, offering an exclusive look deeper into the Shire. Let's see what's going on in the absurdly cozy town of Bywater: 




Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is in the works for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Unless they pull a brutal bait-and-switch, something tells me we won't have to worry about a nasty scouring of these idyllic accommodations.

You can even use them as a damage block if you drop them from a high place, making for some surprisingly overpowered situations if a mob or player gets stuck in one spot.


How to craft an Anvil in Minecraft


Crafting an anvil requires obtaining 31 iron ingots, turning 27 into iron blocks, and arranging them in a sideways "H" shape in a crafting table. You'll need to place three iron blocks in the top three squares of the square, followed by four iron ingots in the bottom three squares, plus one in the center.

Summer may be over for all you Northern Hemisphere dwellers, but we've got a bumper feature in store for you very soon that'll keep the summer vibes alive as days grow shorter. We'll be publishing an enormous career-spanning interview with Mr. Kaz Ayabe, the developer behind the Bokunatsu (My Summer Vacation) series who's been helping us enjoy the seasonal sunshine for more than two and a half decades now with games like Attack of the Friday Monsters, Shin-chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation, and most recently Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid.
To whet your appetite for Nintendo Life's upcoming interview, we've pulled an interesting nugget from our conversation with Ayabe-san which details the origins of his studio's name, Millennium Kitchen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Piece is a Roblox experience where you'll obtain combat skills, fight bosses, and climb leaderboards to become the most powerful warrior around. Whether you're a new player or already approaching the level cap, there's always more to learn. Here's where the Jujutsu Piece Trello and Discord come into play.


How to join the Jujutsu Piece Trello


You can access the Jujutsu Piece Trello here to learn more about the experience before jumping into the action. There are cards about puzzles like the Dojo Area and special items like the Style Orb, allowing you to learn more about mid-game features you may have never heard about.





Since Jujutsu Piece Studio created the Trello in September 2024, it'll take time for it to populate with more information. Over time, more details will surface, especially as the team releases more updates for the experience.


How to join the Jujutsu Piece Discord server


Like many Roblox experiences, Jujutsu Piece has its own Discord server for you to talk to others in the community. Joining the server lets you access general Roblox chats, free rewards codes, development channels, and more. There are also language-specific chats for connecting with community members in particular regions. 


Once you join the Jujutsu Piece Discord, you'll have to follow the steps below to verify your account:



Create a Discord account if you don't currently have one.


Join the Jujutsu Piece Discord.


Head to #verify and use the Bloxlink link to connect your Discord.


Link your Roblox account to your Discord and Bloxlink account.



If you've already connected your account to Bloxlink in the past, you'll unlock everything automatically after a short delay. Otherwise, once you complete these verification steps, you'll unlock access to the Jujutsu Piece Discord server's channels, allowing you to read its rules and talk to others right away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Around the World SBC is the final challenge of Hybrid Nations in EA FC 25 Ultimate Team, and completing it will get you some great rewards at cheap prices.


This SBC is centered around using cards from different nations together while ensuring that all the requirements are met. While the SBC won't be extremely difficult to complete, the conditions are still tricky. Let's take a look at how you can complete this challenge easily without spending an excessive amount of coins.


EA FC 25 Around the World SBC tasks


The Around the World SBC has only one task. Here are its requirements.


Task 1 - Around the World SBC



Exact Nationalities in Squad: 10


Min. 8 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 81


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 24



EA FC 25 Around the World SBC solutions


The priority while completing the SBC is to use cards that are already present in your club. That way, you won't need to spend too many coins. However, don't be shy to buy a few cards if necessary. Here's a template solution that you can use.



Fall ST (71)


Immobile ST (82)


Rafa CAM (83)


Bjorn CM (78)


Pawollek CM (82)


Masuaku LB (76)


Eriksson CB (83)


Ladd CDM (80)


Janssen CB (84)


Kleinherne CB (80)


Grbic GK (73)



Potential Costs: 8,400 coins


After completing this SBC, you'll get a Rare Players Pack for your efforts. This pack usually has a worth of 50,000 coins in Ultimate Team. Getting it after completing the Around the World SBC is a great trade-off. Additionally, if you have also completed the three other challenges of Hybrid Nations SBC, you'll be rewarded with a Rare Mega Pack as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GOG has revealed the release date for the last game in their re-releases of the Resident Evil series. Resident Evil 3: Nemesis joins the rest on September 25.


GOG announced that they were working on re-releases for the first three games in the Resident Evil series back in June. At that time, they launched the first game, with preorders open for the other two. In August, Resident Evil 2 followed, leaving only this one remaining.


And, honestly, I’ve never played through OG Resident Evil 3. I played the 2020 remake, but I don’t think that’s really the same thing. It was fine, but not really up to standards with the Resident Evil 2 remake that came before. So, I’m looking forward to playing it on PC… right after I actually get around to playing the first two. Weirdly, I did find time to finally play through Resident Evil Revelations, which was sitting on my Switch for yonks. I guess I get distracted easily.


While Resident Evil 3 launched on PS1, there was a PC version released. However, by many accounts it wasn’t very good, and getting it to run on a modern OS causes even more suffering. So, GOG went to work upgrading it to run more effortlessly.


Resident Evil 3 re-releases on PC via GOG on September 25, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot dog!
Back in the days of the Wii, one of the more interesting and bizarre major third-party releases was Epic Mickey, a project headed by Warren Spector—the renowned creator of the Deus Ex franchise. This 3D platformer placed the famed mouse in an unusually dark premise that presented him with various moral dilemmas, and though it had its issues, Epic Mickey certainly stood out as a memorable adventure for the mascot and did well enough to warrant a sequel and a weird 3DS spin-off. Now, Disney has decided to give the game a revisit with Epic Mickey Rebrushed, and though it still has some jank, we’re happy to report that this remaster fixes many of the original’s problems.
Epic Mickey’s story begins with the titular mouse visiting Yen Sid’s workshop, where he quickly misuses the wizard’s magic paintbrush and inadvertently brings ruin to his prized project, a magical world for forgotten cartoons. Years later and long after forgetting the incident, Mickey is accosted in the night by a shadowy ink creature that drags him screaming into the world he destroyed, but not before he manages to grab the magic paintbrush on his way. Now abandoned in the Wasteland, Mickey needs to find a way to escape while either finishing the work he started or using his newfound power to help the toons who have been struggling to survive in the wake of the destruction he caused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that their Wider World of Atari DLC for Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is out in a few days. It launches on September 26. 


We still don’t know what games are going to be in the DLC. The information we have says it, “Includes 19 playable games and eight video segments in a completely new timeline.” Past Zoey had some good predictions for what was going to be included, but present Zoey is kind of out of it and can’t use her whole brain. Present Zoey needs to take a nap. However, YouTuber MetalJesusRocks will be revealing the games the day before on September 25.


As a reminder, this is the first of two DLC packs that are expanding Digital Eclipse’s Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. The other is titled The First Console War, and releases November 8, 2024. That one will include games from the Intellivision library, as well as Atari. It’s an interesting inclusion for an Atari celebration collection, but the company did just buy up Intellivision’s back catalog and brand (not the Intellivision Amico, fortunately).


Atari 50 is already one of the best game collections, as it includes both behind-the-scenes information to give context to the games, and the games themselves. An Atari 2600 game can be very underwhelming on its own, but the information behind them give new value to them. Atari 50 became the blueprint for Digital Eclipse’s “Gold Masters” series, which includes The Making of Karateka and Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, which are both great in their own right.


The Wider World of Atari DLC for Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration arrives on September 26, 2024. The games in the DLC will be announced on September 25. Finally, The First Console War DLC is out November 8.

Here's a big old number for you: Nintendo is 135 years old today. Not on the red-capped platforming front, of course, but it has been 135 years since Fusajiro Yamauchi founded the hanafuda playing card company, Nintendo Koppai, in Kyoto on 23rd September 1889 (at least, that's the most commonly agreed-on starting date).
We won't risk the fire safety hazard of lighting 135 birthday candles on a store-bought Mario cake, so let's take a look at where things started for the Big N instead.

If you have had so much as a passing interest in the pop music scene of late, you likely will have heard of Chappell Roan. This is the recipient of the VMA's Best New Artist Award and the voice behind such pop belters as 'Pink Pony Club,' 'HOT TO GO!,' 'Femininomenon' and more. She's also a casual DS admirer, it turns out — at least as far as its videography capabilities are concerned (thanks, Uproxx).
This was a revelation from Roan's recent stop at the Brixton O2 Academy on her Midwest Princess Tour, where she spotted a fan in the crowd snapping pics on the dual-screened device. "B***h, is that a DS?" the pop star lightheartedly pointed out between songs, "You keep taking photos on your DS, you keep doing it."

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

In Slime Slaying Simulator, you're taught the basics and then are sent out into the world to kill slimes, earn new gear, and unlock new parts of the world so you can conquer the Slime Queen and many more monstrous enemies.

Ubisoft, it's safe to say, hasn't had the best year. At the time of writing, the company's share price is sitting at a pretty dire €12.07 following middling reviews and poor commercial performance for Star Wars Outlaws; a game that is arguably Ubisoft's most important 2024 release following the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows.
It's not all doom and gloom, however. Earlier this year, Ubisoft also released Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and it stands as one of the most impressive 'Metroidvanias' in recent years thanks to its comprehensive combat system, innovative parkour mechanics, and thoughtful puzzle-solving gameplay. We awarded it a coveted score of 9/10 in our review, but we're not the only ones who thought it was pretty great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a Stardew Valley player on console or mobile, the long-awaited good news about the 1.6 update has arrived, and it's set to release on November 4. 


Like a baby that’s grown in the womb and is ready to be born, the release will come very close to nine months after it arrived on PC. 




This is great news, as now all players will be able to experience everything new that was added in the 1.6 update, and some of you can finally stop avoiding any and all spoilers. I tip my hat to any of you who have been avoiding any Stardew Valley guides because I’m not sure how you’ve managed it. 


This does pose a specific problem for some players who have been making the most of the Tea prices. You’ve got six weeks from the time of writing to get all of those Tea Saplings sold, or you’re going to half your profits thanks to a lovely price nerf introduced in 1.6.

It is a shame that it has taken this long for the update to come to players on anything other than PC, and as yet there is no word from ConcernedApe as to the specific reasoning. Perhaps there never will be, and players in the comments of Ape’s tweet are simply overjoyed that they’re finally going to experience the update. 


The good news is two-fold. Firstly, thanks to the delay, there’s a guide available for everything you could possibly get stuck in with 1.6. Second, this means that ConcernedApe will be able to refocus his efforts on his next title, Haunted Chocolatier. He’s previously stated that he’s been unable to put any work on his next title due to the extra effort involved with porting Stardew to consoles and mobile.

Eagle-eyed players spotted several key details Rain World's The Watcher DLC trailer, including a lack of Iterators, walking snails, and some fresh-looking animated backgrounds that hint at new environments. The franchise is known for an incredibly complex ecosystem that interlinks as you explore, with every environment impacting the other in some way. But fans want something that cuts deep from the DLC. A region or regions cut off from what we've seen before.

This is also great brand integration because Sonic X Shadow Generations is releasing on October 22, and Shadow will be the main antagonist of the third live-action Sonic movie, releasing on December 20. 2024 is the year of Shadow the Hedgehog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fran Navarro Squad Foundations SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can get an immediate upgrade for your offensive line at a very reasonable price.


Navarro becomes the first player from the Portuguese league to get a promo item. All players have equal chance of getting the card as he's part of a special challenge. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the card, and if he's worth your fodder. 


EA FC 25 Fran Navarro Squad Foundations SBC tasks


The Fran Navarro Squad Foundations SBC is relatively beginner friendly compared to the recent releases. It has two tasks, and the conditions are pretty reasonable as well. 


Task 1 - Spain



Min. 1 Players from: Spain


Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 2  - 84-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 84

Bachmann (82)


Taremi (80)

If you have surplus fodder in your club, this SBC could be worth considering. You'll get a 85-rated ST item with 3* Skills and 3* Weak Foot. There are obvious limitations, but the item can be better than most budget striking options. It also offers the Finesse Shot, Power Shot, First Touch, and Incisive Pass playstyles. 


If you're struggling in the attack, this Squad Foundations item could be cheap temporary fix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Moments mode might not be on top of your priority list in EA FC 25, but it can be a great way to improve your Ultimate Team squad.


By completing the Milestones moments, you can get a Jumbo Rare Players Pack, which is valued at 100,000 coins (if you bought it from the market). You'll also get enough Stars to open a Rare Players Pack from the Moments store, which is usually valued at 55,000 coins. While completing the set can be pretty tricky, an ongoing glitch and a second controller can make your task a lot easier.


EA FC 25 Moments Glitch explained


The Moments game mode is a PvE experience where you tackle the AI in custom scenarios. Each scenario has certain conditions in order to complete them and earn the rewards. Some of them can be pretty hard (the last two sets of the Moments Milestones are great examples).


However, there is an ongoing workaround that lets you simplify the process of completing any Moments you want.



Connect a second controller.


Go to Friendlies.


Select Couch Play.


Use each controller to select a side (as if you're going up against your friend).


Quit the match.


Go to Moments and start one.


Now, you'll be able to control your team and your opponents (without the glitch, your opponent will be controlled by the AI).



Image via Destructoid


Once you complete the Moments Milestones across all difficulty levels, you'll automatically get a Jumbo Rare Players Pack, along with additional packs as well. There are two Rare Players Packs as well, which can be unlocked using stars from the Moments seasonal store.


While this method reportedly works on PC, I tested it out on PS5. You'll need to have a separate profile on your console for the second controller. That allows the game to think that two separate persons are playing, allowing for the glitch to happen.

The game is coming to Kickstarter and already has a pretty large following, so any miniatures fans won't want to miss it. 


In Trench Crusade, you pick up, assemble, and paint the forces fighting with the armies of hell in an alternate version of 1914, 800 years after a group of heretical templar knights opened the gates and let the forces of evil swarm out. There are six factions to choose from, a set of skirmishes and bloody campaigns to play through, and over 60 miniatures to paint with gloriously unique designs so you can both impress and terrify your opponents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

Cheers then, The Bird Of A Thousand Voices, for showing up in my inbox and giving me a second reference point next to Sugar. This one’s a simple though very striking platformer, inspired by folk legends and scored by composer Tigran Hamasyan. It’s part of a multimedia project based Armenian folk tale Hazaran Blbul (Firebird). It’s completely free, and you can find it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mad lads at Square Enix have released a demo for their remake of 90s RPG Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven, in which you play a whole dynasty of customisable protagonists fighting vengeful ancient heroes. It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

Slackers: Carts Of Glory looks like a co-conspirator in this endeavour. It's basically that one bit in Jackass where the gang blast downhill in shopping trollies at great risk to their bodily and mental health, as is their wont. The arcade racing game came out yesterday and features online multiplayer, so you can break someone else's bones too. Let's see it in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company was one of last year's surprise horror hits. It was a brilliant dystopian scavenging sim in which you searched cellars for bolts while avoiding the attentions of creatures that hate being looked at, or which only move when they're not being looked at, or which look like your friends, from a distance. The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

The sidescrolling metroidvania is a rich, expansive, and surprisingly challenging take on a genre typically dominated by indies, and it's precisely the kind of game I wish mega-publishers produced more.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive.

Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People waiting impatiently for The Sims 5: you have sinned against Simming and must do penance. In your temerity and ignorance, you have cried out unto developers Maxis and publisher EA for another sequential helping of the cuddly/sociopathic neighbourhood-building game - a "sequel", if you will. Know ye not that we live in the time of Disrupted Models? Sequels are archaisms devised by the old gods in their dotage. Let us all join hands and set forth into the sunny uplands of the Connected Cross-Media Cross-Platform Universe.

Its crime: an inability to "run well" on the Steam Deck’s internals, regardless of settings changes. Dammit, Clive.

We've already seen a description for the PC version appear briefly on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher found similar game descriptions buried amid metadata.

In response to a community sentiment best summed up by a popular Reddit post titled “Let the super earth burn”, Arrowhead released a statement. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update…what matters most now is action. Not talk.” Said action (which, it must be pointed out, felt a bit troublingly reactive to the loudest and most histrionic voices in the roo..uh, subreddit) was foreshadowed in a list of issues to be tackled over the coming months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really wanted to like action adventure The Plucky Squire more than I do now, having given its charming 2D to 3D platforming a proper whirl. Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

Namely, that the majority of its pre-release buzz has centred around its proximity to Persona, and not its far more entertaining quality of having the most gleefully bizarre RPG enemy design this side of Elden Ring’s horn-tooting orbpeople.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.
Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To survive in looter-booter Pacific Drive you have to keep the paranormal station wagon you drive around in good nick. You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

In between burrito recipes and hymns to the Fujifilm X100v, this gorgeous toylike art tool's gamely turning stretches of balmy meadow into semi-ruined castles, semi-ruined villages and semi-ruined citadels. 
Dreamy and slightly haunted, it's conjured words like "bewitching" and "spellbinding" in the comments sections, too. It makes sense, really. Tiny Glade's a game about making rustic dioramas and then photographing them. It's not hard to imagine some exiled magical person might live in here among the rocks and reeds and wild heather.

Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.
It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

Twenty hours ago I placed my first manufacturer somewhere around here. Back then it represented the state of the art, hatching me a pristine batch of 1.25 computers every minute - now I’ve forgotten where I put the damn thing, after delving into my factory’s guts to hook that piddly yet still useful batch of old relics up to my main production line. I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.
Something is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry. It is mesmerising and it is fearsome, and after five years of early access it’s finally complete.

"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda51 told Gi.biz.

However, in roughly ten days' time, hackers will descend on São Paulo for a two-day hackathon. Cash prizes await those who manage to disable pirate IPTV devices to the extent they can no longer communicate with their owners.

It became an obsession for some in the two weeks the website was online, as players fought to fill all the boxes, or undo the work of their peers.

The fight was far more complicated than it seemed, as the developer recently explained, with some players finding ways to encode hidden messages in the checkboxes.

All pretty and crunchy and satisfying. It's just a shame it only lasts a week or two before turning into mulch on the pavement. Reminds me of a Regina Spektor lyric: "Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die". And now, inevitably whatever I write below this will be a lie, because I'll actually spend my weekend listening to old Regina Spektor songs, because she's just the best.
But for now at least, let's keep up the pretense that we're not all lying through our teeth every weekend with these posts. Here's what we're all (allegedly) clicking on this weekend!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.


What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.

The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.

My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.

The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.

Whatever my feelings about the entertainment value of these streams, I can't deny I watch all of them, or that they introduce me to games I might have otherwise missed.

Next on the calendar is the Convegence games showcase on September 26th, which is a new event that - hey, what a twist - promises to feature exciting indie games. It does have some recognisable publishers onboard, including Secret Mode, Thunderful, and Kepler, among others.

Unfortunately I can't think about anything other than the Steam Families logo, which is pictured above and is clearly a shocked, possibly aghast face. Or so I thought at first. The more I stare at it, the more it seems to reveal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.
The ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle.

Mere weeks from release after years of delays, plopped in front of me at a cramped, lightly vibrating Gamescom booth, and you still won’t reveal your secrets. I did get to play a brief whizz through GSC Game World’s eerie FPS – enough to feel encouraged, even – but be it time constraints or the darkness of my nighttime raid into the radioactive Zone, I would have liked to have quite literally seen more.
Then again, keeping the mystery intact may have been the point all along. "As a game director, I want to hide everything from the player", GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych had told me minutes earlier. "I'm fighting with the marketing team because they want to show as much as possible!"

Either way, Frontier are hoping to cater for all humankind's quirky day-out desires with Planet Coaster 2, by adding water slides and wave pools to the teacups and train rides of their management sim. I had a short go on it, and while there's no chance two hours of hands-on time could give me a full impression of the building game's suite of creative tools, I was quietly pleased with the jungle-themed pool I nestled into the earth. And with the little shark mascot I hired to patrol it.

The horror nous required to impart unease in the middle of the day are somewhat eased up on when you’ve got all that serotonin-begone drizzle to work with, sure. But this feels more poignant than that. There’s a soulful drearines and utterly heartbreaking inevitability to the vibe here, as your character and rubber suited activist pals try to get the bottom of a horrific incident. It’s got best British indie horror film of the year written all over it.

That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".

I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 


That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, Nightmare Operator, what are you doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?
Ok, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.
You play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am torn between being deeply annoyed at the fact roguelike deckbuilder Bramble Royale: A Meteorfall Story allows me to poison skeletons, and actually finding it very funny. I suppose it would take an unnecessary amount of setup to lampshade that my dexterity brawler, Mischief, actually switches out her regular poison for bone-hurting juice when fighting skeletal undead. So, you get a pass for now, game. Here’s a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam’s family sharing feature Steam Families is now available to everyone on the platform, letting up to six total people share games from a single library, with each individual having access to their own saved games, achievements, and workshop files.
This means that, yes, when you all sit down together in the evening, you can enjoy a hearty family meal in the knowledge that between you, you technically own six copies of the Cities Skylines Big Butt Skinner Balloon.
Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale "showdowns" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.

Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

Výborní herci, výborná atmosféra jednotlivých scén, ale velmi brzy jsem se přestal snažit chápat, co si z toho mám vlastně odnést.

Z toho, co se děje na plátně, nevyplývá nic víc než "Podívejte, co se honí v mé šílené hlavě, zajímá vás to?" Mě osobně ne. (Ilča 20 %)]]></summary>
