It's time for another clash of cover art as we dive into this week's edition of Box Art Brawl!
Last time things got NESsy, as we pitted three different cover designs for the original The Legend of Zelda against each other and oh boy was it a close one. The classic gold North American / European art just sealed the victory with 36% of the vote, while the Japanese Famicom and FDS releases followed closely behind on 33% and 31% respectively.

I've played it for eight hours since buying it yesterday, hooked by a progression curve that takes you from an ineffectual mining ship chipping at a single planet's rocky surface until you explode, to the leader of a swarm of bomb-dropping drones and aerial bombardment lasers that can travel a solar system and devour any planet to its core in seconds.

It's part idle game, part Vampire Survivors, and it's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grab your nunchuk gun and cool glasses, Videlectrix’s hotly anticipated blockbuster Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate has arrived.
Starring the hunky Strong Bad as the eponymous private eye slash crooked cop, Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is partially a remaster of a 2008 Flash game, half a bunch of new stuff, but all point-and-click. This game comes in hot with new animation, cutscenes, and voice acting. Adventuring has never been quite so… Dangeresque.
Extravagant summary aside, I’ve been a Homestar Runner fan since high school. Which, yes, was a very, very long time ago. The flash webtoon was one of the earliest influences on my writing style, and a lot of that is still with me. Unfortunately, editors don’t often like it when I deliberately mangle sentences or haphazardly mash words together to form clumsy new ones, so I have to pull my punches.
From what I remember of the original Roomisode, it came out as sort of a teaser to the then-upcoming Strong Bad’s Cool Game For Attractive People. With this and the recent de-listing of SBCGFAP from digital storefronts, I’m really hoping I wake up one day to news of a Cool Game remaster. But for now, I have the Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate to keep me warm at night.
Looks like you’re gonna have to jump to Steam or Itch.io to pick up a PC version of Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate.

M2’s garage doors are open for business again, continuing to pay homage, and in fastidious attention to detail, to the shoot 'em ups of yesteryear. Zero Fire, a portmanteau of collected titles Zero Wing (1989) and Hellfire (1989) represents Toaplan during the height of its glorious arcade tenure.
Although released just four months apart, Hellfire is chronologically the first in this collection, a side-on horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up that was borne from the instruction to make a game like Konami’s Gradius. Hellfire was the company’s first horizontal foray, and its production was particularly problematic. Director Tatsuya Uemura cited it as being “extremely difficult to make” in an interview for the Toaplan Shooting Chronicle, a music collection, and that it was memorable only for the struggle he and his team experienced during its manufacture.

It's difficult now to remember a time when the Switch eShop wasn't rammed with low-cost, low-quality games making it laborious to find the great new releases amongst all the dross. What began as an immaculately clean, functional store back in 2017 quickly ballooned and before long Nintendo was inundated with software submissions vying for visibility on a crowded digital marketplace. Inevitably, these included titles from less-than-scrupulous developers and publishers looking to make a quick buck.
In recent months, the number of quick-and-dirty 'clone' games seems to have exploded, though. The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival is a notable example which is no longer on the eShop after it caught the attention of Sony's copyright lawyers. That was an open-close case, perhaps, but the underhand tactics being employed by select publishers make a handful of PC-based bullshots look like quaint, small-fry false advertising.

Ladies and gentlemen, the weekend.
For a slightly quieter one, this week was packed full of highlights here on Nintendo Life. The August Pokémon Presents happened and it will undoubtedly go down as one of the showcases of all time — but we did get a release date for the Scarlet and Violet DLC and two new NSO games, which is good. Quake II finally came to Switch after rumours a-plenty and we even got the surprise announcement that Red Dead Redemption would be coming to Nintendo's little console — who would'a thunk it?

And by "the real world" I mean "other video games". Although not many, admittedly. BG3 is very big. I think I'll be the first to break free from its metaphorical chains because I played it for review, but I'm still puttering about trying to take the roads I un-taked the first time. Still, we've got time for some Apelegs and some little demos and some seeeeecrets and whatnot.

Ahead of Netflix's One Piece premiere later this month, Mexican actor Iñaki Godoy - who plays Monkey D. Luffy in the live-action adaptation of the popular manga and anime series - has spoken about how Nintendo games have influenced his career.
He "loves" series like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda - referring to Link and Mario as his "two heroes" growing up while calling the Wii title Super Mario Galaxy "one of the best pieces of art". Unfortunately, he feels like he's missing out on some parts of Nintendo's history - with the 19-year-old actor revealing how he would "really love" a GameCube to experience a number of "iconic" games on this platform including Wind Waker:

As you might have already seen, the Pokémon World Championships is taking place this weekend in Yokohama, Japan. While it's the same format to previous years, it seems there's actually been a bit of drama in the new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet competition.
In a story on Kotaku, it's mentioned how a bunch of "stricter checks" have caught a number of professional players off guard - ultimately ending their chance to become 2023's video game Pokémon master. Anyone using hacked versions of Pokémon to create their own perfect party and skip training has been busted by the tournament organisers.

Meanwhile, between games like DuckTales and Chip ‘n Dale Rescue Rangers, Capcom had a good run of great Disney licensed titles under its belt. Yet I can’t help but feel the acclaimed developer must have felt a certain weight in developing this title.
I mean, we’re not just talking any character. This is the Mickey Mouse, arguably the most famous animated character ever created. Outside of publishing Hudson’s Mickey Mousecapade, this would be Capcom’s first time giving Mickey a starring role. They can’t just make a fun platformer with some classic tunes to do this character justice. Nay, a game about Mickey needs to feel grand, exciting, and ma…]]></summary>

Hamilton Simulator is a new Roblox experience from Super League and Small World Games, in an adaptation that AP reports has the blessing of Hamilton writer-composer Lin-Manuel Miranda. To roughly approximate how to describe it, it's like an idle gacha game. And if you've never seen a Roblox game before, well, you're in for something.

If you've played any Diablo 3 season you'll quickly notice this upcoming season looks pretty monumental in comparison. On the flip side, Diablo 4's recently released first season, Season of the Malignant, is pretty lackluster.
I've gotta admit, it's a bit odd that after a decade of 28 pretty simplistic seasons for Diablo 3, we're just now getting a feature-filled season that includes a new mode, an intriguing new seasonal theme, and some bigger class balance changes.
Is Diablo 3 about to get a better season than Diablo 4?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A teaser at the end of the 2022 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase hinted a new South Park game was coming. Naturally, it was assumed that it would be the next installment in the popular South Park RPG series. However, it appears that won't be the case.
During the 2023 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, South Park: Snow Day was officially revealed. Players will battle through the snow-piled streets of South Park with up to three friends. Apparently, the highlight feature is that South Park will be in 3D, though I'm not sure that's a good thing.
We also got a reveal trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEv35KH-DXQ
I think I'd rather have another 2D RPG
Even though South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: Fractured but Whole weren't for everyone, I could definitely appreciate what they were going for. A comical adventure in the world of South Park intended for fans of the show. Also, there's something to the 2D charm and honestly, it looks kinda goofy in 3D.
In fact, the trailer reminded me a lot of the South Park game on N64. Obviously with more modern visuals, but the same sort of goofy 3D graphics and gameplay.
No details on the actual game were provided other than it will be 3D and feature co-op multiplayer. It kind of looks similar to Fat Princess to me, but it's hard to really tell until we know more.
South Park: Snow Day will release in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.

Beyond just being successful at innovating and even defining various genres, they had a strong interplay between their games that put even modern Nintendo to shame. Their development teams weren’t just skillful and talented, but they seemed to have real pride in their company. It felt like they were fans. And through that passion, it was hard not to become a fan yourself.
It makes the trajectory of modern Konami feel like that much more of a betrayal. They’re sitting on the games they made us fans of. Or worse. Some are just getting sent to the graveyard that they send all the properties they’re not interested in making new games for: Pachislot parlors.

Updated with the outstanding port of Quake II. Enjoy!

Nintendo Switch's bulging catalogue of games covers practically every genre, and First-Person Shooters are no exception. It's a welcome change because Nintendo systems have historically lagged a little behind other consoles in the FPS field despite hosting some classics. After all, GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark helped define the FPS on consoles, and the Metroid Prime series shifted the exploration of the 2D Metroids into a first-person perspective to great effect. Still, Nintendo consoles have often missed out on the best multiplatform shooters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reports had surfaced earlier this year from Nickelodeon that the popular TMNT comic book, The Last Ronin, would not be hitting the big screen but instead would be getting a 'God of War-style' AAA video game. As it turns out, those reports appear to be true. During the 2023 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin was officially revealed. TMNT: The Last Ronin follows a lone surviving turtle in a dark alternate future battle-ravaged New York City.
THQ Nordic also dropped a very simple reveal trailer, though it doesn't really tell us much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2ixJFWXcg
I have to be honest, I completely forgot this was a possibility, even though Nickelodeon subtly revealed it earlier this year. When I saw the Nick logo I thought we were getting another Spongebob title. I have nothing against Spongebob, but this is definitely way better.
Unfortunately, we didn't get any sort of details other than it will be based on the best-selling comic book. Also, it's worth noting that this is an official adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin, so it will probably follow the story of the comic.
TMNT: The Last Ronin will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. No sort of release timeframe just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Moscow court has found Dmitry Glukhovsky, the author of the original Metro 2033 novel and its sequels, guilty of "deliberately spreading false information," leading to a hefty eight-year prison sentence. The charges state Glukhovsky posted texts and videos on his social channels claiming that Russian servicemen have been committing crimes in Ukraine.
As reported by the Associated Press, Glukhovskey was tried in absentia as he is not in Russia. A famed journalist and author, Glukhovsky was pronounced a "foreign agent" last year due to his critique of the Kremlin and Putin himself. This case falls under the law passed by Russian parliament shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, imposing jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading "fake" news about the military.
Dmitry Glukhovsky has been a vocal critic of the Russian regime for some time, and he hasn't been hiding it at all. The author has talked openly and critically on social channels about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022.
Within games, Glukhovsky is well-known as the author behind the Metro series that spawned the video game adaptation. These dystopian novels follow survivors living in the metro of Russia, as rival factions vie for power beneath a post-nuclear wasteland.
Even within the gaming world, Glukhovsky is hardly alone in his critique of Russia's behavior. Metro 2033 developer 4A Games called for support among many others, helping shine as bright of a limelight on the situation as possible for the industry.
Some of the developers have, of course, had first-had experience with the war. Some of the devs have fought and even reportedly died on the frontline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My brain absolutely struggles to remember the name Turbo Overkill. It’s a combination of two words that are usually just appended to a game’s title to differentiate itself from previous games in the series, such as Street Fighter II Turbo and House of the Dead: Overkill. And then, with all the other retro-inspired shooters currently mixing things up, I can’t tell it apart from similarly titled games like Ultrakill.
In terms of standing apart with gameplay, the story’s a bit different. While many retro-inspired shooters attempt to gain success from excess, few are as successful at climbing over the top as Turbo Overkill, for better or worse.

        <updated>2023-08-11T19:48:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.
In the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. "Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin."


According to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year GeForce Now accidentally leaked a few unannounced titles, including Titan Quest 2. Unfortunately, such leaks aren't always accurate, so I didn't get too excited.
However, as part of the 2023 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, we got a first look at Titan Quest 2. The action RPG will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Even though we didn't see any gameplay, the announcement trailer did show off Ancient Greece as we've come to appreciate it in Titan Quest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6yb8OoFvw
I can't wait to explore Ancient Greece again
Titan Quest was a very popular ARPG that came out back in 2006 on PC. Eventually, it was remastered and re-released on PC as well as consoles, and it received several DLC expansions that brought the title back to life. Praised for its build diversity, itemization, and replayability, Titan Quest also served as the framework for the popular ARPG Grim Dawn.
According to THQ Nordic, the sequel will return to the classic mythology-inspired setting of Titan Quest. The upcoming action RPG is being developed by the creators of SpellForce 3. Furthermore, Titan Quest 2 will feature some of the staples from the original, including a flexible character system, meaningful loot, and challenging combat. Also, TQ2 will include online multiplayer just like the original Titan Quest.
Without getting a look at the gameplay, this is about as excited as I can get. I put hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours into Titan Quest as a teenager. It was clearly a passion project from Diablo 2 fans. Despite how great D2 was, I personally enjoyed Titan Quest overall more.
THQ Nordic didn't provide any release timeframe yet, but hopefully we'll get some more details about Titan Quest 2 soon.

Freshly announced at tonight's THQ Nordic Showcase, I've been playing an early, hour-long demo build of it this week, and while there are certainly things to admire here, I'm not overly convinced it's going to be one for the ages. Its colourful visuals and contrasting colour palette cast its deep caverns and sun-drenched mountains in a beautiful, but eerie kind of light, and its strange, scuttling creatures put me in the mind of the night horrors from Dredge and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. But its central premise of you being a headless body carting round an inflatable head to presumably escape to goodness knows where isn't quite the breath of fresh air I hoped it would be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THQ Nordic and Appeal Studios have semi-re-announced Outcast 2: A New Beginning as plain old Outcast: A New Beginning, having sensibly decided that positioning it as a sequel to a 24-year-old game might turn younger audiences away. In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.
In Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You're here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can't argue with the verticality and agility on display.

It sees you hunting down Nemesis, goddess of retribution, who has gone a bit do-lally and is meddling with the Threads of Fate.

Former developer at Rare Chris Seavor has been sharing video game history on Twitter. And today's little tidbit is a pretty fun one — Seavor has found the first-ever drawing of Conker the Squirrel.
Seavor teased his followers earlier today about "some 'curious' old scribbles" that he found, and as promised, he later shared photos of the sketches that he created from back in the day. Rare fans will know that Seavor not only designed the squirrel, but he was also the voice of the mischief-maker

Specifically, Alone in the Dark, Gothic, Outcast: A New Beginning, Wreckreation, and Trine 5 will be in the show.
Those interested in watching the digital showcase with us can do so on the THQ Nordic YouTube or Twitch channel.
You can also watch along below:

What can we expect from the Digital Showcase?
Once again, we have been told there are in fact some world premieres coming to this showcase. Furthermore, some of the titles they confirmed to be speaking about are releasing in the next few months, so I'm sure they will be highlighting those in particular. Trine releases at the end of this month on August 31. Also,  Alone in the Dark releases on October 25, so I'm sure we'll see some more gameplay from it.
Their showcase last year ended with a hint at a new South Park game which we have yet to get more details on. Who knows, maybe we'll get more info on that.
Personally, I'm hoping to see anything Darksiders. I am excited about the Gothic remake so definitely down to see more of that, and maybe even a release date. For now, all we know is that THQ Nordic considered 2024 as the realistic release window for it.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a Community Update post on Steam, Larian Studios has revealed just how much players are loving Baldur's Gate 3. More specifically, users have a combined playtime of over 10,000,000 hours; which equates to over 1,225 years. With a current all-time peak of 814,466 concurrent players on Steam, it was obvious that BG3 was getting serious playtime. But, even still, these numbers are massive.
Larian also revealed some pretty interesting stats from the opening weekend. Half-Elf is the most picked race and much to my surprise, Paladin is the most chosen class. Not that there's anything wrong with Paladin, I just expected it to be something more obvious: like Barbarian or Rogue, or even Wizard. Githyanki and Halfing aren't the go-to choices for that many people, nor is the Cleric class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 is off to a pretty great start in terms of its, thus far, glowing reception and player engagement. Developer Larian Studios has released a fun infographic accumulating player data gathered from the game’s first weekend, and the results are a mix of surprising, amusing, and flat-out staggering.
Last weekend, you played 1225 years of Baldur’s Gate 3. As we head into the second weekend of launch, we’ve compiled some tasty stats for you to sink your teeth into.
https://t.co/zKYgOuq1DS pic.twitter.com/Vij4ncdkdb
August 11, 2023
You can view the fun infographic in the embedded tweet above, but we’ve summarized each bullet point below:
368 players finished the game during the opening weekend.
Over 93% of players rolled a custom character
Players spent a combined 88 years in character creation
Nearly 10% of characters spent at least one hour in character creation
Gale was the most popular Origin character selected at 27,784 players
Gale was the 7th cause of death for players
Paladin was the most popular class choice at over 200K players
Half-Elf was the most popular race choice at over 250K players (barely edging out Human at 2nd and Elf at 3rd)
Almost 100,000 players have been rejected by Astarion (Shadowheart was the most popular romance option, followed by Gale)
One NPC was shoved into a chasm for every concurrent player during peak engagement on Sunday (815,000 players)
12% of player deaths were caused by friendly fire
65.1% of players saved Emerald Grove
Scratch has been petted over 750,000 times
Players spoke to over 1,400,000 corpses and over 2,400,000 animals
Players have played at least 10,000,000 hours (over 1,225 years)
Needless to say, a lot of players appear to be having a great time with Baldur's Gate 3, and we look forward to seeing how these stats evolve over time, especially once the PlayStation 5 version launches next month.

We were saddened to learn that in the former of these releases, the original development team was not credited alongside all those who worked on the remaster, with some members of that 2002 team calling the practice a "travesty". Therefore, it was with great anticipation that we waited to see whether Quake II would get the same treatment. Fortunately, things are better this time.

It also had a fair few balancing issues for the dev, Gunfire Games, to deal with, though, and the latest PC update follows through on them.
Remnant 2 on launch day overwhelmed its players with a wealth of content and a solid progression system, meaning it took a bit longer than expected for its problems to crystalize with the community. Issues with survivability were certainly a highlight, but some unexpected quirks with character archetypes came up, too, and the new Remnant 2 PC update released on August 10 alleviates a …]]></summary>

Making your character a ranger in BG3 (which has some very slight differences) is even better; you can essentially brew a rogue that is better at taking damage, but can still do most other things you traditionally use a rogue for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has unleashed a "Mega Man Summer Pack" on Steam, and it's worth raving about. For $29.82 (normally $134.94) you're getting a massive chunk of Mega Man, spanning multiple Legacy Collections, Mega Man 11, and the Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. If you were to pick up the recent-ish Battle Network re-releases, you'd have a pretty good collection of many mainline Mega-games. You can cross-check that for yourself in the image below, taken from my Mega Man collection (which I started in 1990!).
[caption id="attachment_396110" align="alignnone" width="640"] Photo by Destructoid[/caption]
Here are all the games you get with the Mega Man Summer Pack (with reviews!)
While the bundle technically states that you get "six items," it's actually six compilations you're picking up with the Summer Pack. It covers the vast majority of mainline Mega Man history, from the original 1987 classic to 2018's Mega Man 11. Note that like other Steam sales, if you already have access to any included games, the platform will deduct the ones you own from the total price.
And because we're Destructoid, we reviewed them all! Feel free to peruse the links below if you're looking to just pick up a few compilations, but the entire shebang is worth it if you can spare the coin.
Mega Man Legacy Collection
Mega Man Legacy Collection 2
Mega Man X Legacy Collection 
Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2
Mega Man 11
Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection
There's a larger Capcom End of Summer Sale going on if you're interested
Mega Man is arguably the best part of Capcom's "End of Summer Sale," but there's a bigger promotion going on at this landing page here (the summer is ending? Man life goes by fast).
Highlights include:
Okami HD
Capcom Arcade Stadium
The Disney Afternoon Collection
DuckTales Remastered
Strider
Dark Void Zero (for $2.49!)

I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3's redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s. But I've come round to the new Mothership after reading Blackbird Interactive art director Karl Gryc's thoughts on its creation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the mobile RPG retelling the FFVII saga, finally has a release date. The game was first announced in February 2021. 
Ever Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.


This will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.]]></summary>

Murdle is a free daily logic puzzle game that you can play in-browser at murdle.com. They're like luxury versions of those ones you'd get in thick, half-sized paperbacks from WH Smiths, next to the books of sudoku, where you have to figure out who lives in which house and what colour their car is with clues like 'Peter does not not have a four-wheeled drive. Murdle is better, though, because the puzzles are themed around being a detective - or, technically, a Deductive - called Logico solving a murder. You get a new one every day, and it's neat-o.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite Twitch being embroiled in controversies (seemingly on a constant basis), it's still the number one choice when it comes to streaming or watching streamers. This is evidenced by the fact that viewership seems to be on the up and up, with millions still tuning in each month.
Cold hard data seems to back this up, as a report from Gamesindustry.biz states that Twitch has recorded 1.8 billion hours for July 2023. This represents a 5% increase over June, with daily viewership having gone up since March of this year. The figures come from StreamElements and Rainmaker.gg.
[caption id="attachment_396076" align="aligncenter" width="640"] Image via Backstage.[/caption]
On top of that, GTA 5 is still the number one game to watch, with 139 million hours logged. Other top titles for the Amazon-owned platform include League of Legends, Minecraft, CS:GO, and Dota 2. Basically, a lot of PvP and/or otherwise multiplayer games.
Recent Twitch backlashes
However, it's not all peachy for Twitch. The site came under fire from streamers recently when its new Partner Plus program was announced. Many felt that qualifying for the better revenue split was unobtainable for a lot of people who rely on the service for income.
Maintaining a recurring subscription count of 350 for three months already sounds like a lofty ask. Add to that the fact that Amazon Prime subs and gifted subs don't count, and it's easy to see why a lot of streamers find this target difficult.
That said, from a viewer's perspective, things seem to be going pretty well. With close to two billion hours in total watched for July alone, gamers are evidently finding plenty to watch on Twitch. It's just a shame the company continues to disappoint many of its broadcasters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all heard the news. Quake 2 has been officially remastered, and non-other than Nightdive Studios was responsible for its creation. While the contents of id Software's classic game are enough to keep us satiated (especially those of us who love the original 1997 release), there's something else to look forward to.
In a recent post on Twitter, Laced Records, a company that specializes in vinyl soundtracks for video games, is unleashing Quake 2's music. The tweet links to the website, which shows there are two versions, one of which will be a limited edition.
https://twitter.com/Laced_audio/status/1689683030313500672
While both of them will set you back $38 each, the limited edition press will feature "two solid red and orange A-side/B-side effect LPs," which looks pretty fancy judging by the images.
When can I get it?!
Hold your horses. This Quake 2 vinyl is not out just yet. The website says both versions will be released in January 2024, but you can pre-order yours now.
The soundtrack to the game is quite memorable, heading much more into rock/metal territory than the NIN ambient sounds of the first Quake game. Q2's music was conducted by Sonic Mayhem (who also did soundtracks to games like The Division and Deux Ex: Mankind Divided) and Jer Sypult. Horror director and musician Rob Zombie also contributed to the game's main theme.
It may be more than two and a half decades old, but Quake 2 is an important part of 90s gaming, especially in the FPS genre. Okay, it may not have had the same impact as the first Quake or the OG Doom entries, but it's still a classic, and now we have a remaster (and soon the vinyl) we can enjoy.

Look, we already went and slapped a big fat 10/10 on Quake Remastered when it dropped almost exactly two years ago, calling it “a stellar port of one gaming's true greats and an essential addition to your Switch library.” So what on Stroggos are we meant to say about this absolutely cracking remaster of its absolutely cracking sequel?
Well, let’s not beat about the Big Gun here, this really is another flawless victory for retro FPS fans, a truly exhaustive revamp of Quake II that respectfully tweaks and refines the core gameplay of a bonafide classic whilst making sure to pack in every bit of extra content we could have possibly asked for…and then some.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Those into speedrunning will know Games Done Quick very well. Events like SGDQ 2023 help to raise staggering amounts for good causes, and now it's the turn of Flame Fatales, which is kicking off this weekend.
The all-woman speedrunning event runs from August 13 (that's this Sunday) right up until August 20. You can check the Games Done Quick website for more details about it. Flame Fatales will run in aid of Malala Fund, a charity co-founded by Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai that fights for "every girl’s right to 12 years of free, safe, quality education."

You can also check out the schedule that's now live, showing who's playing what and when. Essentially, it's going to be a week that's jam-packed with some of the best women speedrunners around, helping to raise money for charity.
Millions raised
Over the years, the Games Done Quick brand has helped raise a ton of money that has gone to a number of worthy causes. Earlier this year, AGDQ raised $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. That's not chump change!
Flames Fatales is just one more opportunity for streamers and runners to come together to provide video game entertainment, while also doing good in the world. The act of speedrunning (where you aim to finish a game as quickly as possible in any non-cheat fashion) has become immensely popular. People dedicate hundreds (if not thousands) of hours to perfecting their techniques in order to shave off milliseconds.
It's something that just about anyone can get into, but it takes an enormous amount of effort and time to truly be counted among the best. Let's hope Games Done Quick's Flame Fatale event is just as successful as the others that have come before it.

Back in March of this year, we heard that D-Pad Studio — the team behind the brilliant Owlboy — was working on a remaster of its debut title, Savant, to coincide with the game's tenth anniversary. Well, that plan has grown a fair bit, it turns out, and the studio has today announced that what began as a little remaster project has now developed into a full-blown sequel: Savant - Ascent Remix.
We don't have a precise release date for when this will fly onto Switch just yet (the studio has confirmed that it will be after the PC release on 15th September), but from what we have seen so far, this is looking particularly sweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD and Bethesda have unveiled a limited-edition Starfield-themed Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPU and Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU at Quakecon 2023. Both are decorated according to the forthcoming open world space-me-do's "NASApunk" aesthetic, a blend of cool whites, blues and yellows which I will admit to finding rather attractive, as somebody who generally finds gaming hardware aesthetics an absolute turn-off. It's certainly better-looking than Nvidia's lurid Cyberpunk 2077 GPU from 2020, but if you're similarly beguiled, there's an unfortunate catch: only 500 of these GPU/CPU sets are being made, and they're exclusively available as part of a Quakecon giveaway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 has launched on Steam and well, Activision Blizzard are probably regretting that right now. At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who've already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game's direction and faults.


Many players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2's switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2's story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard's recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard's alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch's emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive role-playing game, rife with decisions and choices that can come to a die roll. Consequences of a failed roll in Baldur's Gate 3 can ripple out across the game, ranging from small changes to big shifts in the story. And even though you've got modifiers and tools, you're still always beholden to the die.
To that end, I get why we are now rehashing the age-old save-scum debate. In some ways, it's a little silly; it's your game, so you should play it how you want.
What I would like to do, though, is encourage a few of you file perfectionists out there to embrace the failed roll. I come to you as a documented save-scummer myself—my XCOM Enemy Unknown and Fire Emblem files more than verify as much—saying that failure isn't just entertaining in Baldur's Gate 3.

To help you with your adventure, we've put together 7 beginner tips for challenging Thelos in Atlas Fallen.
Try out the Knuckledust weapon
Even though you start with the Dunecleaver and Sandwhip unlocked, you will obtain the Knuckldust very early. The Knuckldust is a fist weapon that can ramp up to deal massive damage.
I actually played through a fair portion of Atlas Fallen before trying out the Knuckledust. After giving it a try I never swapped it out, as it synergizes well with the Sandwhip. It may end up being your favorite weapon too.
When fighting multiple enemies at once, a good offense is a good defense

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Destiny 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn (among many other roles) actor Lance Reddick passed away unexpectedly. In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.
Today, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).
He has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.
In the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, "I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work."]]></summary>

After an absolute dearth of new content on the tail end of the original game's lifecycle, Overwatch 2 did little to regain favor with its community, thanks to polarizing changes to the game's structure and the cancellation of the highly anticipated Hero Missions. However, with Season 6, titled Invasion, the Overwatch 2 development team is making huge strides to release a content drop absolutely jam-packed with new modes, new maps, and even a new support hero. Following my exclusive look at Overwatch 2's Toronto Story Mission back in June, I was once again invited to go hands-on with Overwatch 2: Invasion – this time, with the entire Invasion update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taito and Inin have announced that a port of 2005 arcade title, Spica Adventure, is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox One sometime in Spring 2024.
Never heard of Spica Adventure? That’s not surprising, considering it was only released in Japanese arcades in 2005. It’s a twee sidescroller that is sometimes considered a spiritual successor to Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III (also with an upcoming port). You play as Nico, who beats the crap out of robots with a magical umbrella. It’s an interesting platformer in the classic arcade style that came out when that particular niche had gone all but extinct.
https://youtu.be/HP7rF_d8j64
This is really good news for another reason. It might mean Taito is eyeing some other Taito X board games that were never released outside of the arcade. Chase H.Q. 2, maybe? Or, heck, we could use a Chase H.Q. collection. It’s exciting to have Taito mining through its back catalog of arcade games with things like the Taito Milestones collections.
The arcade platform benefits heavily from preservation efforts. Even if there were home ports of a given game, they were often inaccurate. Because the hardware was often extremely different from game to game, emulation can be difficult, so some companies just don’t even bother. It’s nice when someone makes the effort.
Spica Adventure will be coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox in Spring 2024. Physical editions for Switch, PS4, and PS5 will also be up for pre-order on November 14, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has announced that the new voice of Destiny 2's Commander Zavala will be none other than the legendary Keith David. David is known for a variety of acclaimed performances, having appeared in Cloud Atlas, Pitch Black, and the Halo franchise. He will now continue Zavala's journey following the tragic news that the character's former actor, Lance Reddick, had passed away earlier this year.
The Destiny 2 community was hit with the news about Reddick last March, bringing his long tenure as the talent behind Destiny's Commander Zavala to an untimely end. Reddick was responsible for a substantial number of iconic video game, film, and TV show roles. The issue with Destiny, specifically, was that Bungie would need to recast Zavala moving forward or scrap the character entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're about two weeks away from the release of Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. Those playing on Xbox who have preordered the game can preload Armored Core 6, letting you can play as soon as it releases. Unfortunately, PlayStation and PC gamers will have to wait a bit longer.

Armored Core 6 preload size
The download size when you preload Armored Core 6 on Xbox is about 53GB. This is a bit on the smaller side in comparison to games like the recently released Baldur's Gate 3, which ended up being about 122GB. However, FromSoftware has always managed to keep the file sizes of its titles in check.
For comparison, the massive open-world Elden Ring was under 50GB on consoles and only 60GB on PC. Dark Souls 3 was only 25GB on all platforms.
When we look at the file sizes of Elden Ring, Xbox as a platform was right in the middle. Therefore, it's possible the size of Armored Core 6 will be smaller on PlayStation and bigger on PC.
[caption id="attachment_395925" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Bandai Namco[/caption]
What about Armored Core 6 preload on PlayStation and PC?
Unfortunately, there's been no word on a pre-load date for Steam users on PC. Even though we don't have a date, typically Steam grants a couple of days of pre-load before a AAA release.
PlayStation players on the other hand will be able to pre-load Armored Core 6 starting on August 23, which is two days before it releases.
Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon releases on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on August 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are you reading this for? Nightdive’s rumored remaster of Quake II has been released, and you might already own it if you already had a version of Quake II on Steam or something. If the PC version is too good for you, then it’s also available on Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation platforms. What am I even writing this for?
Okay, because I’m expected to meet a certain word threshold to please the internet robots, I’ll tell you more. Bethesda and Nightdive dropped a remaster for the original 1996 Quake back in 2021, and it was an excellent source port of the classic game. It kind of felt like a similar Quake 2 remaster in the KEX Engine was an inevitability, but we only heard murmurings about it until today.
Quake 2 was initially released at the tail end of 1997, and featured a new, jazzed-up engine to take advantage of hardware acceleration. It wasn’t initially planned as a sequel to Quake, but gradually began shifting in that direction. Most notably, it has no narrative connection to the first game’s very loose story. Instead, it introduces a space war against the cyborg-like Strogg.
Quake is often considered to be the last game by id Software’s classic line-up. After some creative differences, a bunch of staff departed id, including John Romero. You can absolutely feel it in Quake 2, as it’s unusually cohesive for the studio. There was sort of a wild experimentation in early id games that kind of lags behind the technical wizardry in Quake II.
Okay, good enough? The Quake II remaster is now available on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. It includes all its expansions, as well as a port of the N64 version’s campaign. Cool, bye!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spread open your wallets, the Pokémon Center Store has unveiled a new 10 ¼ inch plush. This one depicts everyone’s favorite protrusion, Wiglett.
Numbered 960 on the National Pokédex, Wiglett was introduced in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. While they resembled the shorter and more girthy Diglett, Wiglett is considered a different species rather than a regional variant. You can tell Wiglett apart by its much longer, slender length capped off by a red, nose-like tip.
The plush stands firmly at 10 ¼ inch length and 4 ¾ inches wide, which is quite a bit below average for your standard Wiglett. It’s held up by a large, sack-like base. Its long, pale shaft will no doubt delight company when you display it for all to see. The store page notes that its body is bendable, so it should stay rigid and erect as you pose it into different configurations. Meanwhile, its soft body invites you to take it into bed with you so you can spend all night together.
All in all, Wiglett is a perfect addition to anyone’s collection of Pocket Monsters. Judging by social media’s response, it is already being embraced by fans everywhere. It’s the perfect way to add some excitement to your evening.
The plush Wiglett is available now at the Pokémon Center shop for $24.99. Not for internal use.

It's very good. But if you're one of the many who haven't, the premise is thus: an ancient evil has, as ancient evil is wont to do, arisen once more to threaten the great walled city of Baldur's Gate, and by extension the surrounds, and by further extension the world and all the deep gnomes, elves and sexy demon wizards therein. Through happenstance and literal brainworms, you and the band of strange adventurers you meet in the first act are the only ones who can save the day. Don't worry, you don't need to remember or have played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2. So. Off you go, then.

An enhanced edition of the 1997 game, it includes the mission packs The Reckoning and Ground Zero alongside a PC version of Quake 2 on N64. All that for £8 or $10, plus a brand new expansion titled Call of the Machine, developed by Wolfenstein: The New Order studio MachineGames.
While not as beloved or enduring as its predecessor or successor, Quake 2 is one of the Grand Old Shooters. I recall being introduced to it at a covert LAN party in a school IT room, plonking myself down at a monitor and instantly being reduced to a fine red mist (and in the game, etc). The singleplayer campaign had you scrapping across a muddy alien world with shotgun and hyperblaster, with larger levels than in the original Quake, and missions where you'd use heads as keys.

We had a lot of fun. Their new VR2 is really amazing.” The tweet also included a PS VR2 video ad featuring Osbourne.
The seemingly innocuous message caught the attention of the UK's Advertising Standards Authority. The main complaint is that the tweet did not adequately identify itself as marketing material.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had you asked me yesterday about the best Baldur's Gate 3 class, I might have picked Bard - versatile, swish, a solid support both in and out of combat - but that was before I discovered the ancient and honourable Larian discipline of barrelmancy. As the name suggests, it's all about doing mildly game-breaking things with barrels, crates and other heavy containers, by taking advantage of high strength, the Throw command, and the fact that Larian RPG characters can somehow fit items as big as they are into their inventories, without bursting apart like rotten haggis.
A straightforward tactic: consider lugging a few oil barrels into a throne room, and dropping them all around the resident big cheese before you confront him. Given reasonably careful distribution, it's possible to finish a whole battle this way in a single turn. Fortunately, while Baldur's Gate NPCs can be eagle-eyed when it comes to sneaking rogues, they're perfectly indifferent to people surrounding them with heavy explosives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ravenage Games has announced that Königsborgs’ card-based restaurant-slash-mafia sim Don Duality will be released on August 25th.
Don Duality has you in the shoes of a newly empowered mob boss.  You have to juggle both the demands of organized crime and your money-laundering restaurant front. It uses a card-driven system that takes you through the difficult crime-slash-dining events as you build up both empires. You’re tasked with equipping your crew and keeping your customers happy while restoring your family to their rightful place in the criminal underground.
I’ve said this before, but Don Duality reminds me of the Pizza Connection games. They both connect organized crime with restaurant management, which is a pretty tantalizing mix. In Pizza Connection, you would send goons to sabotage and steal from your other competitors, which I don’t think is what this game is going for. We can hope, though.
Or you could just check out the prologue demo, Don Duality: Initiation. I meant to do that, but I only really play demos for work, and I never got around to it. I’ve enjoyed a good few deckbuilding games recently, love management games, and also do a lot of crime, so this looks up my alley. Maybe it’s up your alley too. You can talk to me. I won’t tell the cops.
Don Duality releases on PC on August 25, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's face it: If it weren't for the modding community, games like Fallout 4 probably wouldn't still be a major part of the AAA gaming world. Despite the Bethesda RPG coming out in 2015, it's still getting plenty of love, as evidenced by this one modification that fixes load times.
Thanks to Nexus Mods user Antonix35, you can now enjoy speedier loading times with their Fallout 4 plugin. As well as making the game load faster in general, the mod also fixes "in-game vertical sync for high frame rate monitors," adds in the ability to "select loading screens," and more.
https://youtu.be/bfEcyRJ4Bo0
The modder says the whole thing works by "speeding up slow locations in game code that are slowing down other loading threads." Now, I don't know much about the inner workings of modding so that means nothing to me. However, some of you out there will have a better understanding of what Antonix35's Long Loading Times Fix does. I mean, it works!
The proof of the pudding is in the loading
Just to make sure that we get an idea of just how fast Fallout 4's load times are now, a video has been provided that shows the mod in action.
A timer in the corner displays how much quicker it is now to fast travel between locations and other loading zones. Some of the times are now just a couple of seconds. The quickest one seen in the clip is when the player enters an internal location at Diamon City, which clocks in at 0.64 seconds.
In fact, the longest time we get to see is when the game itself is loaded up at the start. It takes just over eight seconds to boot up the save file, which is still pretty impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highly anticipated Tekken 8 recently caused a stir among fans when they noticed that the End User License Agreement on Steam made mention of the controversial anti-tamper software Denuvo. Fortunately, game director Katsuhiro Harada took to Twitter to announce he has “no plans to introduce Denuvo or anything else.”
https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1688677772116504576
According to Harada, the mention of Denuvo is likely because the EULA is a copy of Tekken 7’s. Although Harada’s Tweet isn’t a definitive confirmation that Tekken 8 won't use the anti-tamper software, it is a good sign.
[caption id="attachment_394394" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Tekken 8 could avoid some of Tekken 7’s problems
Developers use Denuvo to prevent (or at least stall) games from being cracked and pirated. Ideally, it shouldn't affect gameplay. Nevertheless, both players and developers have previously complained about the anti-tamper software, with some developers eventually removing it from their games. Denuvo has acknowledged the negative press, though the issues surrounding it continue.
Tekken 7 was well recieved when it released in 2015. However, it did suffer from frame rate drops and other performance issues on PC. Harada attributed this to the game’s anti-tamper software, which happened to be Denuvo. This naturally explains why fans felt upset about the mention of Denuvo in Tekken 8's EULA, and why Harada is so adamant on avoiding it.
https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/984835707209375744
Though Harada has suggested players “sit quietly”, impatient fans have been exploiting the Closed Network Test to play beyond the test period. Tekken 8 will release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, though it has yet to receive a release date.

The nearest I've come to doing so is that one episode of the Simpsons. The major things I am given to understand about it are that it is very confusing, sexy in a ghoulish way, and 100% comprised of memes in the same way that Hamlet has retrospectively become a book's worth of quotations.
I have, however, played a surprising number of very decent games that are influenced by Twin Peaks - Zelda: Link's Awakening, Silent Hill and the amazing Lone Survivor, to pick a few that I know about for sure. So who knows, perhaps I won't be utterly bamfoodled and confluzzled by Twin Peaks: Into The Night, an unofficial PS1-style adaptation of the game that has just surfaced on Itch.

It takes the Soulslike credentials of the original, gives them a grittier makeover, a much bigger world, and a magical lantern that reveals a gnarlier version of the universe you can actually step into.
Having spent roughly 90-minutes with the game, I'd say it has strong Dark Souls 2 energy mixed with a realm-hopping gimmick that's surprisingly impressive. While it's definitely too early to make big claims, I could see LOTF as a genuine competitor in the saturated Soulslike arena.

The first Lords of the Fallen released in 2014, a time when From Software’s Dark Souls series consisted of two games. Bloodborne wasn’t out, and Elden Ring hadn’t yet redefined what the action-RPG genre can be. Lords of the Fallen was among the first Soulslikes to appear on my radar. It didn’t hit for me and I put it down after a few hours. It was slow, clunky, and allowed for little wiggle room in gameplay style. I yearned for the flexibility of Dark Souls’ various classes and the speed some of them allowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been bolting together some ideas for a longer Starfield feature and while plying the sliplanes of Reddit, stumbled on this conversation about the game's handling of time. As many of you will know/be very weary of hearing, Starfield features hundreds of planets, together with moons and space stations, scattered around the galaxy in different solar systems. Real-life planets, of course, aren't fixed points: they rotate and orbit their stars at different speeds, depending on their mass and distance, which means that days, nights and seasons have different durations. 


Starfield appears to model this to some degree. Bethesda's Starfield Direct from June makes a fleeting distinction (thanks, JuiceHead33) between "local time", corresponding to where you land on a planet's surface, and "UT", which sounds like an abbreviation of "universal time", and presumably describes the passage of time throughout the wider galaxy. Both are displayed in 24 hour format. You can explore planet locations at different local times, as indicated by your fancy neo-Casio watch, with shifting lighting conditions that seem to correspond to the spinning of the planet around its sun. There's footage showing one particular area, The Hitching Post in Akila City, by day and night. The game also seems to model planetary alignments - there's the beginnings of a solar eclipse visible during one segment of the video.

The demake gives you the simplified strokes of the celebrated 2013 game: you're a border control officer, approving or denying entry to the fictional country of Arstotzka, which boils down to checking mugshots and bios against faces that, in this rendition, call to mind Rorschach blots. The representation of an LCD screen with "baked-in" graphics is impressive - I had to fight the urge to tilt my computer to catch the sunlight while playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III was recently announced to launch in November, and a new trailer teases its antagonist: Makarov. The final big bad from the original Modern Warfare trilogy is back in full force, which means bad news for Task Force 141. 
Older fans know him as Vladimir Makarov, the side antagonist in 2009's Modern Warfare 2 and the primary threat in 2011’s MW3. He’s set to take that head villain mantle once again in the third entry of the rebooted trilogy, and a trailer appropriately paints him as the boogeyman set to make Captain Price and Co.’s lives a living hell. The trailer also teases a full reveal of the game on August 17.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III is set to release on November 10.]]></summary>

If it's a bit of video game set dressing that has a legible spine with words on it, I will absolutely scrutinise it to the nth degree. Videoverse, the excellent homage to early 00s internet forums and Nintendo's Miiverse that came out earlier this week, doesn't have spine-filled book shelves, per se, but throughout the game you will see a collection of game magazines piling up on Emmett's desk, and readers, let me tell you, they are a delight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scan the cast list for Stray Gods and you may notice a fair bit of overlap with that of The Last Of Us. Both Troy Baker (Joel) and Ashley Johnson (Ellie) appear in key supporting roles here, while star billing goes to Laura Bailey, aka Abby from Naughty Dog’s sequel. Obviously, this means Stray Gods has some top-notch voice talent on board, but these casting choices also make another kind of sense. The premise of this 'roleplaying musical' is inspired by the Buffy the Vampire episode 'Once More With Feeling', you see, and as in that piece of classic TV, part of the appeal is seeing (or hearing) performers who famously earn a crust in more action-oriented roles forced to prove their singing chops instead.
Thankfully, The Last Of Us crew all have a finely tuned set of pipes on them, not least Bailey, and the notes they belt out absolutely do this game’s charming and entertaining concept justice. Even better, they’re ably backed by the admirable composing skills of Austin Wintory, a fizzy script and pitch-perfect character design.

I'm a fan of musicals of all kinds. From Hamilton to La La Land to Bob's Burgers, if the characters in your story burst into song, I'm more than likely on board. For this exact reason, Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical caught my eye, exciting both my inner fan of musicals and my inner fan of games. Despite some complaints about glitches and awkward songwriting in a few places, developer Summerfall Studios harmonizes these concepts well, putting on a show I can't help but applaud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm still stupidly early on in my Baldur's Gate 3 journey - I did, after all, spend several hours replaying the start to see how different origin characters worked - but last night I had my first real run-in up at the chapel near where you crash land in the big nautiloid. I'd played this bit before in early access, so I knew to fireball the tiny bit of rope to drop the big stone down into the floor and take out the rest of the bandits hanging about up there pretty sharpish. But before I went down beneath the chapel (there were a lot of other nasty bandits down there last time I checked), I had a little extra nose around the outside, eventually discovering a locked hatch down a nearby cliff path that took me to the brilliantly named Dank Crypt.
Sensing not all was well down here, I went into hiding mode and gingerly crept around the place, looting the handful of corpses lying about of their gold and spell scrolls, but leaving their weapons. You see, I have a terrible habit in RPGs of stuffing my pockets with absolutely everything I can find. In Bioshock, I will scavenge everything out of every bin like some feral raccoon; in Skyrim, I had to enable a cheat code for infinite storage one time because I was so overencumbered (and couldn't bear to part with everything I'd picked up over the course of the quest) that I actually couldn't move. And in my early hours of Baldur's Gate 3, I started doing exactly the same thing, looting everyone's swords, daggers and crossbows up on the Nautiloid. Not to much effect, mind. Nothing was really that much better than what I already had. So I resolved to do better and resist temptation. And what a dumb idea that turned out to be...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Baldur's Gate 3 patch is out, and all anybody will talk about are the buggy invisible gnome underpants and the penises clipping through clothing. Larian themselves highlighted it in their patch notes, and the socials have predictably gone wild with talk of girthy githyankis. Well, some of us like to think of ourselves as serious journalists, thank you very much, so I'd like to call your attention to the, dare I say, more grown-up elements of the patch, which range from fine-tuning the tooltips to making dragons appear in the right place.


Tear your eyes from those lurid details of absentee knickers and glitchy sausages, and you'll see that Larian has fixed no less than 13 crash bugs and progress blockers, though sadly not the crash bug I always seem to get when I run the game in DirectX 11. They've also sorted out an issue with enemies entering combat when they're on a different floor, together with the occasional odd prolonged silence in over 200 dialogues, and a smattering of minor issues with cameras and clipping. See, this is the stuff video game news is rightly made of. None of your adolescent leering, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might already know that first-person fantasy RPG Avowed began life as Obsidian's take on Skyrim, but did you know that it was originally pushed as a multiplayer game, prior to being acquired by Microsoft? That's according to studio head and founder Feargus Urquhart, speaking in the latest and final episode of the Obsidian 20th Anniversary documentary, which is chock-a-block with intriguing factoids from throughout the studio's history.


"One of the things I really pushed was that Avowed was going to be multiplayer," Urquhart said. "And I kept on that for a long time. And I think in the end - not 'I think', I know, in the end, it was the wrong decision to keep on pushing on it. Now [the reason I did it] was when we still independent and we were selling it, it was a more interesting game to publishers. And when you're asking for $50, $60, $70, $80 million, you have to have something interesting to talk about. And multiplayer made it interesting. It was this idea of sort of the peanut butter and chocolate, putting it together - it must be something that's good."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar's original Red Dead Redemption can seem rather humble next to the rootin' tootin' excellence of Red Dead Redemption 2, but it looms larger in my memory, albeit not for the best reasons. The original Xbox 360/PS3 game launched with a tidal wave of bugs, some of them game-ending. One particular collection of technical gremlins trapped me on a farm during the prologue. Having sat through some cutscenes, I found myself at the centre of a strange spacetime distortion redolent of the other world in Neil Gaiman's Coraline. If I tried to leave the farm the simulation slowly broke down, with movement consisting of weird fragmentary teleports. 
I saw a distant rider stop-starting through a canyon with his own hat darting through the air behind him. I followed the man for as long as I could, before tumbling through the terrain into uncreated space. Proper Lynchian stuff. Red Dead Redemption 2 had its share of bugs and glitches, but none of them quite as captivating as this. Still, it would have been nice to see the world beyond the farm, and that was my first thought when Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar announced a new Red Dead Redemption port, for release on 17th August. Sadly, however, the port appears to be PS4 and Switch-only for the moment, though a PC release might happen if the stars align.

Mindful that his injunction is being ignored, a U.S. judge has just held the persistent pirate in contempt of court and declared MG Premium the new owner of his pirate domains.

Five years ago, when he was invited to a pre-GDC meeting to pitch game ideas to an unnamed friend, Wintory had one that really excited him. It was a musical game – not just a game with musical numbers distributed throughout, but where the player has control over the music itself. Wintory's friend was less than enthusiastic.
"He said very graciously, but in no uncertain terms, 'I hate that idea, and I want nothing to do with that,'" Wintory recalls. He smiles as he tells the story, finding humor in the irony that this rejected pitch eventually became the game I'm currently interviewing him about.
While his unnamed friend wasn't interested, he did point Wintory towards Liam Esler, a developer with similar ambitions for fi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega have formally unveiled the next steaming helping of Total Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change, which adds three Legendary Lords to this already-jam-packed strategy game: the Changeling for the demonic Tzeentch faction, Yuan Bo for Grand Cathay, and Mother Ostankya for Kislev, plus a brace of new campaign mechanics, units and battlefield abilities. 
I've been going off Total War lately - I fired up a new Lizardman game last month, having developed a hankering for dinos after reviewing Exoprimal, and found myself lingering in disappointment on each faction's reliance on rock-paper-scissors unit relationships. There's only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm. Still, it sounds like the new Tzeentch Lord might wash away my Total Warennui, in being one of those playstyles that is more about tricking and invading rivals than taking territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Pokémon Presents gave us lots of updates on upcoming Pokémon titles, like Detective Pikachu Returns, the classic games coming to Switch Online, and even new raids for Mewtwo in Scarlet and Violet. However, none of those updates were as substantial as the one we got on the upcoming Scarlet and Violet DLC, with the showcase spending ten minutes of its 35-minute runtime to reveal new Pokémon, new areas, and even a release date. Here's everything you need to know about Pokémon Scarlet and Vilet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.


We knew that one of the expansions, The Teal Mask, would be coming in the fall – but now we know the exact date. On September 13, you'll be able to leave the Paldea region and explore the area around Kitakami Village, which is where the DLC takes place. Accor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.
Developer Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,
“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”
While it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. 
WrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.
WresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the most popular Pokémon arrive in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's Paldea region through limited-time events. Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.
Beginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password "GETYOURMEW" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.
The second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect "something special."
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.


During the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you're more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two '90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.]]></summary>

Pokémon Trading Card Game was released for the GameBoy in 1998 and has a similar format to the traditional RPG series, except you're battling with cards instead of actual monsters. Pokémon Stadium 2 arrived in the U.S. for the Nintendo 64 in 2001 and is, obviously, the sequel to the first Stadium, which is already available on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. 
While these aren't the much-requested Red/Blue/Yellow games (or any RPG, for that matter), this is a step in the right direction. Be sure to check out our complete list of every game available on Nintendo Switch Online to keep up with each addition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am but a stripling level 4 sorcerer in Baldur's Gate 3, still learning to distinguish my Magic Missiles from my Chromatic Orbs, my Cantrips from my Colour Sprays (or at least, restore my memories of these concepts from my long-ago Baldur's Gate 2 playthrough). I've just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they're standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&D player handbook. 
These feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to "alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires", up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn't sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur's Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it's far from certain that they'll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There's a good reason for this: higher level D&D spells and abilities are so potent it's hard to include them without turning Baldur's Gate 3 characters into gods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3, out of early access last week, is an officially licensed D&D RPG of many hours of turn-based combat, as you bring together a rag-tag group of misfit heroes to save the world from a mysterious cult. And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn't end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There's one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends. In hindsight, picking from a selection of genitals in character creation was probably a clue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The curious journey of Ironmace's medieval extraction sim Dark And Darker continues with the launch of an early access build. You won't find it in one of the usual places, however. As Kaan reported in April, Dark And Darker was pulled from Steam following accusations of copyright theft from publisher Nexon (Ironmace's founder Terence Park and a developer Ju-Hyun Choi are Nexon alumni who worked on a similar fantasy game, codenamed P3, in 2020-2021). With legal proceedings on-going, Ironmace have released this tense first-person dungeon crawler via their own Blacksmith launcher and third-party store Chaf Games. It's a bit more ceremonial than letting people torrent the test builds, at least.

Here's your teaser trailer, in which the camera skydives through a cosmic wilderness of glowing red waveforms while returning adversaries Captain Price and Vladimir Makarov apparate briefly to the rear. There are mysterious husky whisperings - "he's not new", "never bury your enemies alive" - and you fly through a giant stone wolf's head. What does all this bode? I'm going to say "shooting".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Modern Warfare III will be released on November 10, and we got the briefest of teases in a new trailer today. Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.
The teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. 


In the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.
The video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. 


The last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a "Devolver Delayed Showcase" to tell players all about the games they won't be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.
"We have some exciting news about next year," one host says. "This year's delays," the other host follows up. "Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!"
The Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. 
You can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.


Devolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New graphics card generations are a typical driving force behind gaming laptop refreshes, but CPUs can floor that pedal with just as heavy a boot. The result is often something like this latest Asus ROG Strix Scar 17, which wields not just a top-spec Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 but also one of AMD’s newest and most number-crunchy processors, the Ryzen 9 7945HX. 
That’s a lot of newness, and even more of a specs list: 32 threads from the Ryzen, 16GB of VRAM, DLSS 3 support and so on. And yet, what’s most impressive about the Strix Scar 17 is not simply its immense power, but how balanced – sensible, even – the whole laptop feels like in use. A quality that seems almost impossible at first, given its clear status as a brashly high-end gaming notebook with all the RGB bells and aggressive styling whistles.

Thankfully, DualSense price cuts that appeared first in the UK have now spread to the US, bringing the Sony pad to a reasonable $49. 
Given how well this controller is supported for PC gaming, thanks to the efforts of Valve and modders behind projects like DualSenseX, this makes it an awesome pickup - whether you're looking to play Baldur's Gate 3 in couch co-op or F1 23 with full adaptive trigger support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlatinumGames co-founder, Bayonetta director and celebrated Twitter shoutyman Hideki Kamiya would like the "retro" game label to go out of fashion. His argument is that calling something "retro" is inherently condescending - each game has its own particular achievements and qualities that deserve to be understood in terms of more than just nostalgia cultivated by a novelty-driven industry. After all, Johnny 90s Developer didn't spend months knocking together a bespoke cover system or fancy artstyle so that you could badge it "quaint", "old school" and so on, 30 years later. Assuming you can still access the game at all.
"I don't like the word 'retro game'," Kamiya told VGC in a wide-ranging interview also notable for some chunky insights on onomatopoeia in Japanese manga and its US adaptations. "I'm obviously not a native English speaker so it might be something I'm interpreting from a Japanese perspective, but hearing the word 'retro' from a Japanese viewpoint, suggests more of a 'fad' brought back from a past era and reskinned for the current era."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, and it hasn’t migrated from those platforms since it arrived in 2010. After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.
Rockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it's unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. 


Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.
Described as "a manaical poison aficionado," A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.


While we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 is popular right now. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is also pretty hot at the moment, especially with a new animated film out in theaters. That’s probably why Capcom is bringing the latter into the former in a fun-looking collaboration.
Beginning tomorrow, August 8, TMNT-themed costumes, cosmetic items, and emotes will let players transform their Street Fighter 6 avatars into Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. The event also includes TMNT stamps and titles, plus wallpapers for camera mode. Even the Battle Hub is getting in on the spirit by decking it out with Turtles banners, signs, and trailers. In the trailer below, it looks as silly as you would expect. 


Street FFighter6 had a big showing at EVO this past weekend, as a new fighter A.K.I. was also announced. For more on Street Fighter 6, check out our review.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/07/reptile-ashrah-and-havik-confirmed-for-mortal-kombat-1"/>
        <updated>2023-08-07T14:12:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.
The lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  
Fans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. 


       

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Be sure to check out the previous roster reveal trailers for Geras, Smoke, and Rain.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/08/07/deathbound-is-a-new-soulslike-with-a-unique-class-based-twist"/>
        <updated>2023-08-07T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tate Multimedia and developer Trialforge Studio have released the debut trailer for Deathbound, its new Soulslike action RPG with a unique class-based twist coming to Steam next year. 
Set in a crumbling civilization where unnatural science clashes with fanatical faith, players take on the role of a warrior set on confronting the Church of Death. In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. 
Check out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a "Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world." Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. 
Binding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. 

"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well," a press release reads. "In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike." 
Deathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is the CRPG with a billion and one features, but there will always be players who want a billion and two and yes, I am among these insatiable souls. I cracked a fresh save over the weekend, having bid a sad goodbye to my early access Tiefling rogue, and I already know what I’d like from the game’s modding scene, or preferably, a forthcoming official update. No, it isn’t new races, or increased party sizes, or the removal of the weight limit (which you can get around by offloading spare loot to your Tardis-esque interdimensional campsite). What I’d like most is the ability to switch between characters during dialogue. You’ll trigger many of these conversations without warning as you explore the world, and I routinely bumble into chitchats the character I’m controlling isn’t quite prepped for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a report last week that UK broadcaster Sky had obtained a High Court piracy-blocking order, it transpires that the Premier League obtained a similar order just days later. The orders are yet to appear in public, but we're informed that the Premier League will be able to block pirate IPTV services during the 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 seasons. Interestingly, the Sky order seems to cover a much shorter period but does identify six pirate IPTV services by name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As people of a certain age will know, the current, slow-moving death of Twitter is nothing we haven't seen before. Most of us who were knocking around the internet in the early 00s will have at least one online gravestone in the closet somewhere, whether it's a long abandoned LiveJournal or MySpace page, or an old internet forum that sadly doesn't exist anymore (RPS in peace). But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that's part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren't equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who's just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. 
As he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It's a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone's fun, and yes, there's a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse's source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that's all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don't cut it anymore.

While handheld titles, the poorly received Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and other games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors contained 2D gameplay, Sonic Mania felt like the true successor to the beloved titles that appeared on Genesis and Sega CD throughout the 1990s. A sequel felt all but inevitable, but when Sega and Sonic Mania mastermind Christian Whitehead decided to amicably go in creatively different directions (read the full story here), Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka still wanted to build on the success experienced with Sonic Mania.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I could justify this month's Reality Bytes in any number of ways. I could say the VR launch cupboard is a little bare at the moment, with Steam's New Releases list offering up a lot of dour military shooters, dubious Early Access projects, and fantasy dismemberment porn. I could say that The Room VR: A Dark Matter has just received a PSVR2 release, so now seems an opportune moment to revisit this acclaimed spin-off puzzler. I could say that The Room VR is the only entry in the series RPS hasn't covered yet. But to be perfectly honest, I just fancied playing The Room VR. So there.


Oh all right, there was a slightly more specific reason why I wanted to revisit a game that came out just three days after Half-Life: Alyx. Upon its launch, there wasn't much else like The Room on VR devices, a dedicated puzzler with high production values that didn't feel the need to throw in a gun to shoot or a melon to chop. Now, there are bunch of fantastic VR brain-ticklers swimming in the pond, such as the time-travelling epic Wanderer, the perspective-bending A Fisherman's Tale series, and the ingenious automation extravaganza The Last Clockwinder.

It's partly the style. Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that's unreal and very lifelike at once, and it's sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something. More than that, though, it had me intrigued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not afraid to admit this, but it's become increasingly obvious over the last few days of playing Baldur's Gate 3 that my ability to create interesting custom characters is severely lacking compared to other members of the RPS Treehouse. Case in point, our Ed breezily announced yesterday in our team Slack that he was playing as a Dark Urge bard called, wait for it, Edders Sheeran like it was no big deal whatsoever. I'm not gonna lie, a tiny part of me died inside upon hearing this, simply because of its sheer (not a pun), unadultered brilliance. I mean, come on, it's so good it should actually be illegal. 
But it also confirmed to me a deep dark truth about myself that I think I knew deep down, but had kinda been pushing under my equally drab mental carpet for years and years. I'm quite boring at the end of the day, and am the type of person who, no matter the game, always creates basically the same identical person every single time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somerville is bringing its mysterious alien invasion to PlayStation consoles on August 31. The game comes from Jumpship, a studio formed by former Playdead (Limbo, Inside) CEO Dino Patti.
It centers on a small family rocked by a sudden alien invasion of Earth, who must now survive by running and hiding. The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.


Somerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates. In a press release, Jumpship promises the PlayStation port will be the “best version of Somerville yet” and will feature DualSense haptic feedback.

I don't like squinting at brow density or sliding the juiciness of my lips down a scale, twisting and turning my character as if it really and truly matters when I drown them in chainmail anyway. But getting my fella right for Baldur's Gate 3 was of utmost importance, as they'd be my 100+ hour vessel for awful, awful decisions. And I've started off strong, having created an awful little guy.
Let me introduce you to Edders Sheeran, the bard. On the surface he seems like a cheerful sprite, ready to pat his little drum and have everyone do a nice little dance. Truthfully, he is a psychopath who suppresses the urge to kill, thanks to a malevolent background choice that most would leave for a second playthrough, so as he plays Shape Of You, he also imagines the Shape Of You Dead.

And you can too because we can exclusively reveal that track today. 
It's big, robust, and heroic, fitting if the full game is anything like what we've gone hands-on with. After listening to this track, we interviewed the game's audio director Aubrey Hodges, composer Jamie K, and media composer Tom Hawk about the game's score, how the team created a soundtrack that blends hip-hop with orchestral arrangements, and so much more.

This is not something the game discourages. In fact, I would say that Larian's Dungeons-&-Dragons-but-digital game actively encourages it. Both Edders and Graham found out that you can die almost immediately upon finishing the tutorial and encountering a dying bit of ocotopus sashimi in a crashed ship; fail a roll involved in talking to this unfortunate mind flayer and that's it. Kaput, in about an hour. As Graham observed, the lesson that this teaches you is not "mind flayers are dangerous", because you have already learned this lesson on account of the opening cutscene being all about that. The lesson is "the DM is a prick, so savescum often".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liam and I have been playing looter shooter Remnant 2 in our spare time, as we realised we both couldn't stop thinking about it. Having been burned out of Destiny 2 and most live service games, we discovered Remnant 2 delivers all the benefits of blasting gangly creatures for skill points without all the live service baggage. What a refreshing thing.
Thing is, if two out of the three major bosses we've faced so far took us to court for cheesing them, we'd lose. And it brings us no greater pleasure, knowing we've carved powerful new weapons out of their remains. God, it feels good to be totally undeserving of any credit whatsoever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiplayer survival sandbox Scum has dropped its 0.9 Smokin’ Hot update today to add more of the expected guns, monsters, and balance tweaks. But the update’s called Smokin’ Hot because it makes all the guys in the game, well, smokin’ hot - if you're into men with a Gears Of War workout routine, that is. Following the revamped female character models last year, developer Gamepires continue their early access tour with a refresh for every male character in the game which may or may not include a touch up for the Danny Trejo DLC skin. Take a look at the new beefcakes and beefy mutants below.

Myriads Colon Renaissance is not quite the break from the 4X that I'd tried to get us, but it is a hybrid. You build up a city, explore and conquer new lands, unlock research and ultimately push everyone's faces in, but its other main pillar is tower defence, a genre I very rarely align with. Which is a good sign, right? Two good reasons not to choose it, but I am anyway.

It's one of my favourite games, and I went into 2011's Portal 2 with many a reservation. But it's very good! And there are so many things I love about Portal 2 that it's quite hard to pick just one thing to write about.
I could do "the joy of Portal 2's retro science", where you fall through the floor into the old school Aperture Science labs and see the 60s-ish version of all the big buttons and testing chambers you were put through in the first Portal. I could do "the joy of the corrupted personality cores in Portal 2", a group of corrupted AI spheres including Rick The Adventure Sphere, which is largely just Nolan North making up his own action theme song. I could even do "the joy of potatoes in Portal 2". And then I realised that most of the things I like about Portal 2 also intersect with Stephen Merchant's character Wheatley, a weird little guy (in the most pejorative sense).

All the cinematics we get of this infamous, terrifying murder-bot show him single-mindedly pursuing his targets, scuttling along walls, and wiping out enemies at close range like a cybernetic John Wick. But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.
Season 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities. And guys, I think they might have gone a bit too far making him scary again. I think he might be overpowered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Baldur's Gate 3 finally out of early access, I'm sure many of you will be busy creating your own custom characters right now as you begin your journey through Larian's RPG epic. But I implore you to take a moment to remember the great Losiir, a Githyanki soldier who most of you will probably never meet. That's because he only shows up if you pick Lae'zel as your origin character, because who else would be there to do her fancy sword lunge from above if not a gender-swapped version of basically herself? But he's a good egg, Losiir, even if his run-time as an official Baldur's Gate companion is, err, somewhat short-lived.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.
It’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. 
A spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: 
“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”
Striking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. 
The Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, and a rather important one at that: The crashing issues I’ve had with Baldur’s Gate 3 on the Steam Deck have been, as far as I can tell, fully fixed. No more collapsing back to the Steam library on startup, and no forcing the use of Proton Experimental – it should launch and work straight away. Valve have even upgraded Baldur’s Gate 3 from Playable to Verified for Steam Deck play, reflecting its newfound handheld-readiness.
This means you can safely ignore the first part of this article, where I whinge about software instability as if it’s the the most heinous atrocity humankind has ever inflicted on itself. All the stuff on general performance, settings, and battery life still applies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to Baldur's Gate 3 leaving early access, developers Larian Studios have understandably put a lot of emphasis on the game's custom character creation, what with it being much more firmly ingrained in the world of Dungeons & Dragons and role-playing more generally than, say, their previous Divinity games. But before you jump into creating your favourite D&D build, do take a moment to watch the Introductions for each of its fixed origin characters, too. They're great fun, well-written and have some good jokes in them, but they also reveal some important details about your companions-to-be that you might not have gleaned otherwise. They're also very easy to miss if you're not careful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The distance from the roof of the Counting House to the nearest building in Baldur’s Gate is vast, by design. The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.
Upon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.

GLaDOS’ return, for instance, is a stretch of pure puzzling with just a dash of dread, while your first steps into the abandoned 1960s Aperture facility interrupt a fairly hopeless tone with an upbeat sense of discovery. For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision is teasing a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare-related reveal next week. 
This lighthearted tease, which you can see below, hints that the next Call of Duty is another Modern Warfare, even though 2022’s Call of Duty was Modern Warfare II. However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). 
Jokes on you, real key art here.

August 2, 2023
As you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” 
It seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. 
In the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. Check out this story about how Sony signed a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation after that.

It's the one game I'm confident recommending to anyone to folks who play games frequently, but also to those who don't.

It’s all subjective of course, but for me, its banger of a story, accessible it is, and how you can practically run it on a potato make it a wonderful gateway into gaming in general.

The company’s latest financial report reveals that Tears of the Kingdom sold 18.51 million units from its release to June 30. This led to Nintendo having the highest “global sell-through of first-party” for a first quarter since the launch of the Switch. It says sales of Tears of the Kingdom also drove hardware sales, as Nintendo sold 3.91 million units in this quarter, which ran from April 1 to June 30, 2023. 


Nintendo says those 3.91 million units sold translates to unit sales for the entire Switch family of systems rising by 13.9% year-on-year, led primarily by the Switch OLED Model, which contributed 2.83 million of those sales…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. 
There are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation.

This expansion continues building on the Scarlet and Violet games with even more Paldean species but also adds type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex. This mechanic recalls the Delta Species mechanic from the early 2000s, where the strongest form of a Pokémon could be of a different type than its evolutionary chain. However, type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex actually make sense within the context of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games, as Tera Pokémon often change types when they Terastallize.

Sonic Superstars takes us back to the 2D era of the franchise, where the gameplay is more straightforward, the story premises are simpler, and the character roster is small. That's certainly the case for the playable roster, featuring just Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, but it's also true for the villain roster. Sonic Superstars sees the return of Dr. Eggman, as well as Fang the Hunter (previously known as Nack the Weasel and Fang the Sniper) from Sonic Triple Trouble and Sonic the Fighters, but they're not alone.

Life sims can be great stress relievers by letting you build a digital life from the ground up at a leisurely pace. However, many of those titles offer freeform experiences where more purpose-driven players may struggle with having to make their own fun. Palia aims to satisfy both crowds by tossing dozens of players into a fleshed-out fantasy world to build a life while also embarking on an epic quest. I made a new life for myself within developer Singularity 6’s upcoming free-to-play life sim MMO. While much of it feels familiar, the promise of building a home alongside friends while unraveling a central mystery is enticing for the genre.

This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. 
But I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: "We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun." This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
He did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. 


“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. 
Fallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” 
While waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has revealed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show, the final announced DLC coming to the Nintendo mashup strategy game that hit Switch last October. 
Shortly after the release of Sparks of Hope last year, Ubisoft announced it had three DLCs planned for the game. The first was The Tower of Doooom, which hit the game this March. Ubisoft released the second DLC, The Last Spark Hunter, last month and now, we know when DLC 3 completes the game’s post-launch roadmap because Rayman in the Phantom Show goes live on August 30. 
You can check out the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3: Rayman in the Phantom Show reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“Rayman is back,” the trailer’s description reads. “And he is the special guest in a new mysterious dimension: the Phantom Opera’s network studio. The Phantom, the charismatic ghostly boss of Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, is also coming back and asking for help to improve his channel’s ratings.” 
When Ubisoft revealed its post-launch content roadmap for Sparks of Hope last year, it said Rayman would be featured in DLC 3 and now, almost a year later, he’s finally here. 
Sparks of Hope’s Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC hits the game on August 30. 
While waiting for this DLC to go live, read Game Informer’s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review. For more Mario, check out the reveal trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and then watch the Super Mario RPG remake trailer afterward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mountaintop Studios has released the first teaser for its in-development competitive shooter inspired by anime, manga, and comics. 
Mountaintop Studios is a relatively new studio formed in 2020 by Nate Mitchell, a co-founder of Oculus. Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. 
While its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. 
“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.
"The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” 

We’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 shooters to play right now and then check out our top scoring reviews of 2023.

The Xbox maker announced the controller in a blog post, revealing that the controller is available for preorder starting today.

The controller is onyx blue, with a smoky aesthetic that gives the controller a unique look in the lineup of Xbox Series X/S controllers.

        <updated>2023-08-01T16:53:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest anime to crossover with Epic Games’ free-to-play battle royale, Fortnite. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account officially announced this crossover today with a quick teaser video showcasing some original characters making shadow puppets on a wall in the battle island’s Mega City locale. Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. 
You can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:


Fortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. 
As for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. 
Fortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan.

Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically.

        <id>120886</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/31/nintendos-next-console-will-reportedly-be-portable-like-switch-targeting-second"/>
        <updated>2023-07-31T14:17:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. 
VGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). 


The publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. 
VGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.
In February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. 
Regardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm Studios has released a new Mortal Kombat 1 trailer focused on the Keepers of Time and Geras, a Mortal Kombat 11 debut character returning as a playable fighter. 
The Mortal Kombat studio has released a steady flow of trailers and gameplay since its MK1 reveal back in May, and that continued over the weekend with a new showcase on the Keepers of Time faction and sand-wielding warrior Geras. In it, we get new looks at Liu Kang, including a new fatality for him, and Geras. 
You can check out the MK1 Keepers of Time trailer for yourself below: 


Over the weekend, MK1 director Ed Boon tweeted an image with what many think might be a new character debuting in the game. Boon writes, “New phone. Who dis?” and circles the unknown character, leading many to believe it’s a tease of a new fighter.

Editor's Note: This story previously stated that two new Mortal Kombat 1 trailers were released over the weekend and linked to a Geras trailer for Mortal Kombat 11. It has been updated to reflect that only one trailer was released – the Keepers of Time trailer – which reveals Geras as a playable fighter.]]></summary>

Since the launch of the PS5, audiophiles have asked for Dolby Atmos audio support on the console. Without diving too deep into the nitty gritty, Dolby Atmos is one of the best audio formats when adequately supported. While the PS5’s 3D Tempest audio tech is impressive, players have also wished for Dolby Atmos support. And now, with the latest system software beta, it has arrived.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!
