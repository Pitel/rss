        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Jelly-filled are my favourite".
Donut blocks. We all know them, and we all either love them or hate them as they collapse under the weight of our platforming plumber Mario. These platforms have been around since Super Mario Bros. 3, always waiting to lure us in with the safety of a flat surface, before falling and taking us Mario to his demise. Presumably, because they're donuts, right? Wrong.
Leave it to Supper Mario Broth to uncover the truth behind these devious dough-shaped platforms. It turns out that, despite looking like donuts in the 2D Mario games, that's not actually what they're based on. We've all seen these platforms utilised in New Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 3D World, and a few other 3D games, and they're not just little floating donuts, but rather a tube.

Until now, most of their cloud ambitions have been neatly contained in the console space, but today Samsung have unveiled their latest cloud-enabled PC monitors, presumably in the hope that the combination of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia's GeForce Now, Stadia, Utomik and Amazon Luna services inside their integrated Samsung Gaming Hubs will be enough to convince folks to part with their towers once and for all.

Think of all the dirt and clumps of dust you’d be grossed out by, and don't even get me started about being outside. Giant horrific insects? No thanks. I’m already emotionally scarred from the giant bug puppets in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, and it’s the reason I won’t ever play Grounded (soz Obsidian).
Thankfully, Tinykin takes a more whimsical approach to this hellish situation. It’s a sci-fi adventure platformer where you and a tiny alien army explore a giant house and, as a bite-size summary, it’s excellent. Splashteam have made a fun, laid-back Pikmin-like bursting with humorous surprises and I played the game with a silly grin on my face the entire time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something, Something, McDonald's sauce!
MultiVersus has welcomed its first-ever post-launch character: Morty Smith — star of the sweary Adult Swim show Rick & Morty — is now available to purchase in the free-to-play crossover fighter.
The grandson of mad scientist Rick, Morty has found himself thrust throughout time and space, again and again, facing down perilous situations and entertaining your loud friend Mike at the office. With access to almost infinite regions of dimension, Morty's weak teenage frame will be emboldened in battle thanks to a wide variety of reality-shifting attacks and specials, which may or may not reflect the hilarious events of the long-running animated series. Because I'm guessing, to be perfectly honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCMLGvlOxt0
A Bruiser class character, Morty is a button-slapping brawler, joining MultiVersus roster of heavy-hitters including Garnet, Batman, Shaggy, and Taz. Morty's evolved appendage "Armothy" can be used to knock his opponents seven ways from Sunday in standard attacks, while his trademark all-purpose alien device, Plumbus, is utilized in specials. For long-distance warfare, Morty has access to snake-based projectiles, as well as a Passive which allows him to throw grenades at his enemies or plant them around the battleground for proximity damage. Just like in that famous episode maybe I don't know I'm 41.
Morty Smith is available to purchase in-game now, priced at 3,000 Gold, 700 Gleamium, or 1 Character Ticket. Morty will be followed later in season one by additional DLC characters. These will include Morty's grandfather Rick Sanchez, DC Comics' anti-hero Black Adam, and Gremlins' malevolent Stripe.
MultiVersus is available in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Toge Productions and Mojiken Studios have announced that their gorgeous pixel art adventure game A Space for the Unbound has been delayed on consoles "until further notice" due to issues with the game's western publisher, PQube Games.
The Indonesian-based companies have accused PQube Games of using their position and Indonesian heritage "to obtain a diversity fund from a well-known console platform" which is a grant that's meant to help out underrepresented game developers. This was set up during the pandemic. However, Toge and Mojiken state that PQube "withheld information about the grant and used it as a leverage for their own commercial gain".

Expansions will stick around forever, though seasonal content will still leave at the end of each expansion cycle—and Bungie don't say anything about bringing back all the old stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elsewhere, the classics return.
Last week's UK charts saw the meteoric rise of Two Point Campus on Switch, with the Nintendo console accounting for a huge percentage of the game's sales. While Sega's university sim has fallen out of the top ten this week (down to number 14, in fact), the Switch has remained the title's dominant home, with the current sales breakdown sitting as follows:

Nintendo Switch - 68%
PlayStation 5 - 14%
PlayStation 4 - 14%
Xbox Series X/S - 4%

Of course, these figures only represent physical, boxed copies of the game and they may be slightly skewed by digital downloads. However, Nintendo's dominance in this field is nonetheless an impressive feat — especially as it doesn't include digital sales in its figures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not often that we get to report a game coming out earlier than planned rather than delaying the date, so it's nice to be able to tell you that Gotham Knights has moved its release date up. It's only by four days, though, to October 21st, which is sort of baffling. Maybe Warner Bros. are about to announce a new DC-verse TV show coming out on the Knights' original release date of the 25th? Who knows. But along with this early-release sneak attack is a new trailer, giving us a closer look at the rogues gallery that the extended Bat-family are up against.

The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portable monitors are pretty awesome - they're an easy way to get a dual screen setup going on a laptop, and also work well to expand the Steam Deck's rather modest screen into something a little more co-op friendly. Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. 
You can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page. That's quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fantasy open-world action game with some sleek combat
If you dig open-world action with a fantasy flair, Where Winds Meet might be one to watch. Developer Everstone Games unveiled its new action game Where Winds Meet today, and it's got some style.
Details are scarce so far about it, though we did get some look at the gameplay of Where Winds Meet today during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022. It's a third-person action game, with some gorgeous views and big open areas.
At first glance, it gives off the third-person action vibes of a modern Assassin's Creed or Ghost of Tsushima. There are bows, swords, counters and follow-ups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHVTPbJVrM
Where Winds Meet is definitely taking a heavy dose of wuxia inspiration though. The way the protagonist leaps around in the air, or runs up the side of a ship, is pretty sick.
According to IGN, Where Winds Meet is set during the Ten Kingdoms era. Different factions are vying for power, which seems like good fodder for tough choices and also plenty of battles.
More than just a warrior
Developer Everstone Games also told IGN that the player can opt to take sides in the war, or choose to pursue other goals. You can look to be a doctor, merchant, or even just a wandering swordsman.
Different fighting styles will also be incorporated, to add a little variety to fights.

We only got a small bite today, but I'm impressed by what I've seen so far of Where Winds Meet. A little more fantasy action in the third-person open-world action genre could be pretty interesting. No firm date or window has been set yet, but I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing more from this project and team in the future.
Catch up on the rest of the Gamescom Opening Night Live announcements in our catch-all thread here.

It's a new fantasy action RPG, with super powers, set in a semi-open world. In what is becoming something of a theme for me tonight, however, the trailer doesn't really give much away about the game aside from the topline selling points. There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand. In another continuing theme from games revealed tonight, Atlas Fallen is out next year.

It's been a long time since we've heard about The Outlast Trials, but Red Barrels brought a grisly new trailer to Gamescom Opening Night Live. The developers also announced a closed beta test for The Outlast Trials running from October 28 through November 1. As host Geoff Keighley put it, "That's right, some people will get to play something this year."
If you're generally on board with Outlast (or would be down for a Saw-puzzle-trap-filled take on the series with optional multiplayer antics), you'll want to keep tabs.
https://youtu.be/EVi3-VjbM1U
The Cold War-era premise is that Murkoff Corporation is testing new "methods of brainwashing and mind control." Rest assured, they'll be taking things to their most unhinged extreme. Today's trailer was all gore and grime. I need a shower!
Viewed in slow-mo, I liked the look of traps and gadgets that players can use to turn the tide during these so-called experiments. How the format works alone and with partners, and what happens when some of you perish, remains to be seen. I get the impression that Red Barrels got out of its comfort zone, and that could lead to a fresh new type of survival-horror experience, or potential alienation. I've always wanted a gnarly Saw-like game experience, and being able to share that with like-minded horror fans sounds novel.
More details on the Outlast Trials beta will be announced soon, so for now, just pencil in the October 28 start date, if anything. I'll certainly be in the right mood for this game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, the Dead Island 2: Day One Edition leaked on Amazon, showing a Lenny Kravitz-like warrior on the box cover. So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. 


We follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. 
The gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.


Dead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”
Dead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.]]></summary>

As Geoff continues to add more shows and reveal events under his belt, things are starting to look a little thinner. Although Gamescom Opening Night Live has the potential to give off the air of "the E3 of Europe," today was largely reserved for games that were already shown off in some capacity; or came back with a marketing reboot after years-earlier reveals. It's time for a Gamescom 2022 recap.
There was some cool stuff in there. The studio behind Moonbreaker smartly united with kinda-huge-deal author Brandon Sanderson to bring us a "Hearthstone meets XCOM" game; with a vibrant art style and a customizable mini painting element.

A long-in-development zombie game is back in action, and arriving early next year. Dead Island 2 will launch on February 3, 2023.
During today's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios revealed a cinematic trailer for Dead Island 2. It features plenty of zombie-slaying action, and one of the game's playable characters, Jacob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dv1cqr1npA
We also got a look at some gameplay for Dead Island 2, which features a ton of the bloody first-person action seen in the first Dead Island.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEkkrJpI6XA
Players will be able to play as one of six different characters including Jacob. Each one has their own style and skills, and you can instantly re-spec if you don't like the build you're putting together.
The story takes place in Los Angeles, with locations around the city including Beverly Hills and Venice Beach.
You can play the adventure by yourself, or opt to do some co-op. Up to three players can party up and blast through hordes of zombies together.

Rise from the grave
Dead Island 2 has been kicking around in some form or another for quite a while. We got some indication earlier this year that a Dead Island 2 launch could be set for 2023, and it looks like that's panned out.
While the news did leak a little bit ahead of schedule, it looks like the zombie-crushing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island is due back soon. The original was a goofy, decent enough zombie-smasher with some light RPG elements and good co-op fun. While the successor to the series has been mired in development for quite a few years, we'll at least finally get a chance to see what a new Dead Island looks like soon.
Dead Island 2 will launch for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Stadia on February 3, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A product description for The Outlast Trials says players can expect "mind-numbing terror," and that's exactly what we see in the game's newest trailer. Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.
The game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.
The footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.]]></summary>

As part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, publisher Nexon and developer Embark showed a blink-and-you'll-miss-it trailer for their upcoming game show shooter, The Finals.
The trailer offers very little in the way of context, but seemingly The Finals will focus on an ultra-violent "game" of survival, with players competing in a do-or-die competition to win big bucks and other prizes. Previously released footage featured rat-a-tat gunplay and bombastic explosive-based combat, with some vehicular mayhem and roof-jumping verticality thrown into the mix.
https://youtu.be/Gq-R9GjW-Ik
The concept would suggest we might be looking at a battle royale affair, perhaps with highly customizable player characters, but we'll have to wait a little longer for Embark Studios to play its hand and offer us a little more info on The Finals and its Smash T.V.-style landscape of killing for kash.
Embark Studios also talked up the game's sense of destruction.
"A skilled contender might go in guns blazing, but with environmental destruction in your arsenal, that’s just the start of what you can wield against your foes! All of our arenas can be altered, used, or reduced to rubble — and not just by you."
The Finals is currently in development for PC. Steam playtests are scheduled to begin "soon." Interested players can request access to join on Steam.

Sometimes, you want a game like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 or Elden Ring: One that eats up all your free time, requires careful attention, and takes hundreds of hours to properly understand. Sometimes, you want a game that you can half-pay attention to while you watch Better Call Saul and eat an entire bag of cheese-covered snack items.
Dorfromantik is the latter, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's a chill, zen, low-stress puzzle game that's all about building a landscape according to gentle rules, and it doesn't hurt that it's lovely to look at. If you enjoyed the satisfying building-plopping Islanders, or the charmingly pointless-but-fun Townscaper, then Dorfromantik will scratch that same brain-itch.

Hideo Kojima is one of the most prolific game developers of all time, and now he's launching his very own podcast to share his expertise with the world. During the Gamescom stream, Geoff brought in his "very good friend" Kojima, who said that while he's known for the games he makes, he was "here today to share some other news," that his "podcast program will be available exclusively on Spotify." Kojima will have various guests on the podcast from across various disciplines in the industry, so it looks like we're going to get a pretty in-depth look at the work of a wide variety of developers.

The podcast will be available with both Japanese and English audio, with simultaneous translation. Geoff Keighley will also be involved with a segment to give players up-to-date industry news. The first episode of the podcast will be available in only a few weeks, dropping officially on September 8. The podcast is officially titled Brain Structure, which seems pretty fitting for Kojima and his brand. Kojima is still working on games, by the way — it seems that this is just a side project.
So many gamers admire Kojima and all of the work he's done, so I'm betting this is going to be a huge success for Spotify. I know I'll be interested in hearing more and seeing what the feel of the podcast is — game development podcasts and be a ton of fun, if you're interested in that kind of thing.

Based on the premise alone, I'm waiting in the wings:
"A surreal first-person action adventure game, where the story of Baba Yaga comes to life. Explore an original take on Slavic folklore and forge your own legend. Become either the guardian of the woods, or the terror nightmares are made of."

Yeah, that sounds unique for sure!

It wouldn't be Gamescom Opening Night Live without a handful of vague teasers to set the mood and put out the feelers for newly-established studios looking to staff up. With that in mind, here's the briefest of looks at Wyrdsong, an open-world preternatural RPG from Something Wicked Games, a team founded by Bethesda's Jeff Gardiner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5s48vY3Du8
Cool audio design, a sinister historical backdrop, and... not much else.
"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages," according to the studio. (Ooh, they used the "O" word!) "Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre."
The Wyrdsong teaser trailer led with the team's prior experience, which included games like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Skyrim, Dragon Age Inquisition, and The Outer Worlds.
From what we've seen today, there isn't much to show yet, so we'll have to put a pin in it. I fully expect this game to show up again at a future showcase. As intriguing as the occult-infused fantasy world could be, it's just a blip on my radar until we start to see it up close.

Today during the Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, Polish publisher All in Games (who you might recognize as a publisher for Ghostrunner) announced a new internal development studio: Ironbird Creations. Curiously, it was created with the intention of "creating high-quality new action IPs," and there's one coming our way already in Phantom Hellcat.
Described as being "inspired by the NieR series," this action romp stars Jolene, a woman who breaks the seal of a cursed theater, then is tasked with saving it. Environmental mechanics are seemingly a bit part of the game, as you can destroy walls or slam people into the band pit. Jolene will also power up via theatrical masks, and there's going to be a mix of 3D and 2D perspectives to shift up the mechanics a bit.
Phantom Hellcat's setting is probably the most intriguing bit. A castle filled with vampires, and "plays inspired by pop culture" sound really promising, especially in a Suda 51 type of way. While action games need a lot of love and care to really sing, I have my eye on this one. No date was given, but you can wishlist it on Steam, and it's also set for release on PS4/PS5, and Xbox One/Xbox Series X platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telltale is known for choice-driven storytelling, and yet, the first trailer for The Expanse focuses entirely on action. As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she'll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.
The trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale's previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.
The Expanse is slated to release in summer 2023.]]></summary>

Warner Bros. Montreal released a brand new trailer for its upcoming comic adaptation Gotham Knights. Spotlit during Gamescom Opening Night Live, the trailer contained a new release date of October 21, pulling the DC Comics' title forward a few days from its earlier announced October 25. Make sure to pass the word along to your co-op buddy.
The cinematic trailer featured Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin, and Nightwing as they attempt to protect the city from a who's who of its sickest villains, including the tragic and brilliant Mr. Freeze, the thesp-like monstrosity Clayface, and the mistress of mayhem herself, Harley Quinn. We also saw more from the aristocratic but highly dangerous Court of Owls, and possibly an appearance from (a much svelter-looking) Professor Pyg.

As part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live festivities, WB Games also highlighted Harley Quinn and Mr. Freeze with a new pair of Gotham Knights screenshots.

The trailer starts with a comical cinematic sequence – a teenage boy listens to loud music and plays the air guitar in his bedroom while the once-peaceful neighborhood beyond his window gets vaporized. When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. 
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace. A band of teens plan a retaliatory attack from a nearby tower, and chaos ensues.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.]]></summary>

Scars Above is out and about for keeps now thanks to a Gamescom Opening Night Live reveal, and I'm still not sold, but I am on deck for it!
This is from Prime Matter, Koch Media's "premium gaming label," where Payday 3 and others lie, so there's some inherent promise there that it'll be given the budget it needs. At a glance, it looks like it's a story about awakening something humanity shouldn't have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpDzYLpYaE
Mad Head Games describes it as a "challenging" third-person action-adventure game on an alien planet. The protagonist, an astronaut named Kate, will have to use "ranged weapons, devices, consumables, and melee attacks to survive." The developers also mentioned elemental attacks, managing stamina for dodges, and crafting "different items and gadgets to aid you against the countless threats in this exoplanet."
"Kate is a scientist to her core, and you'll use that scientific expertise to extract information from your surroundings by scanning artifacts, materials, and creatures in order to learn about their features, properties, and weaknesses," according to the Serbia-based studio. "As you explore your surroundings, you will conduct analysis and gain knowledge that will allow you to craft new gadgets, weapons, and unlock abilities in Xenobiology and Engineering trees."
Scars Above is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in early 2023. Did you remember it was shown off in 2021? Me neither!

We've seen plenty of games adapted to movies recently, but movies adapted to games have been a less common occurrence. As we learned today from the Gamescom stream, we're getting a Killer Klowns from Outer Space multiplayer horror game based on the horror/comedy film from 1988. The movie has had a cult following basically since it came out, and it has traumatized us with creepy clowns for decades.
The Killer Klowns game also has the executive director from the Friday the 13th game attached, so it appears that the horror genre makes for some of the best adaptations. The gameplay will feature a 3v7 asymmetrical multiplayer structure, where players must work together to defend the town of Crescent Cove from the evil alien clowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ_YJaniCXs
"It's a total bucket list item to get to work on the next chapter of such an iconic horror IP," said executive director Randy Greenback.
"When we first heard that someone wanted to make a Killer Klowns from Outer Space game, we all had the same initial reaction: finally," said the Chiodo Brothers, who are executive producing the project. "But nothing could have prepared us for the experience that the Good Shepherd Entertainment and Teravision teams were creating. We are thrilled by the sheer passion these folks share for the world of Killer Klowns and the care they have invested in bringing it to life in surprising new ways."
Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is set to release sometime in early 2023 for Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5. You can also check out the beta now, just go to the game's website for more info.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something Wicked Games, a new studio made up of developers whose credits include Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has revealed its first game, Wyrdsong, in a new trailer. 
The trailer was released as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and while it was short, it featured plenty of mystery and fantasy intrigue.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there's not too much to glean from it. However, we did note what was said by the narrator during it: "In the cracks of reality, there exists two lives, one before the shadow and one behind the eye." Sounds spooky. 
"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages," a press release reads. "Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre." 
Shortly after the trailer's release, Jeff Gardiner, an ex-Bethesda Studios dev with credits in Fallout 76, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and more, posted a link on Twitter that leads to the newly-launched Something Wicked Games website. 
"Our goal with Something Wicked Games is to utilize our independent and creative autonomy to create the next evolution of open world RPGs," Gardiner, who is the founder and CEO of Something Wicked Games, writes in a press release. "Our first project, Wyrdsong, has been my dream game for some time now, and I'm thrilled to finally share it today." 
A press release also states the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's quite a jam to get out of
Keeping a band of survivors alive on earth can be a tall enough order, but what about a game set on an alien world? That's the premise of Stranded: Alien Dawn, a simulation-minded survival strategy game from Haemimont Games, the developer of Surviving Mars.
We got our first look at Gamescom Opening Night Live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZI8Bx5yQzg
As much as the art direction isn't blowing me away, it's a solid concept.
Players will need to face random story events, alien attacks, and adverse weather in Stranded: Alien Dawn, according to the team. "However, actions have consequences and as you strive to plan ahead, you must make difficult choices to shape the story of your survivors, balancing short and long-term outcomes with risk and reward."
If you keep your marooned survivors around long enough, you'll be able to upgrade a "simple shelter" into a "high-tech outpost," complete with automated defenses and a space pad. They might not make it easy, though — your people have positive and negative traits. "Only by improving their skills and maximizing their potential will you survive."
Stranded: Alien Dawn will launch on PC with a Steam Early Access version in October 2022.
Haemimont plans to take "at least six months" to finish building out the game before its finalized PC release, with a price increase expected when that day comes.

The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal. Because the weapons have personalities and speak, you'll get to hear said knife tongue thing drop more f-bombs than ever heard before in a boss fight, too. 
Check out the High On Life 9-Torg boss fight trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the boss fight looks like a great time, and it deserves some props for being more than just a who-shoots-who-more type of battle. High On Life hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on Dec. 13. 
For more, watch the High On Life reveal trailer from earlier this summer.

As part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, Focus Entertainment released a dramatic cinematic for its upcoming fantasy epic, Atlas Fallen. The new title is currently in development at Deck13, and will launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X in 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hFePdmcci0
The narrative trailer depicts two powerful heroes, seemingly with the strength of gods, as they protect a passing caravan of travelers and merchants from attack by the claws of some terrifying creatures. The action is set against a desolate, ruined desert world, with civilization seemingly confined to what little rubble remains within the arid lands.
The trailer ends with some very short, but visually very impressive gameplay footage, which sees the heroes of the cinematic exploring the world in third-person. It was a very intriguing presentation, and it will be interesting to learn about the events that led to this bizarre clash of apocalypse, monsters, and magnificent superpowers.
According to developer Deck13, players can "target and gather the essence of your enemies to shape your own custom playstyle, forging a new era for humanity in a fully cooperative or solo story campaign."

Atlas Fallen is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It will launch in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lies of P, a soulslike inspired by – of all things – the story of Pinnochio, got a new trailer today during Opening Night Live. 
The trailer was surprisingly substantive. On top of plenty of flavor text about the dark and gritty world, we saw several gameplay shots – including, but not limited to, destroying giant steampunk monsters in a victorian theater, massive open levels, and even lighting a marionette-inspired spider on fire. A Pinnochio-inspired soulslike might be a goofy sentence to type, but you know what? The game looks really neat. Check it out below: 


Lies of P doesn't yet have a release date. However, it'll be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. Better still, it's coming to Xbox's Game Pass on day one.]]></summary>

Sometimes you see a trailer for a game and think, "yeah, that checks all my boxes." Colorful? Yup. Card-based? Go on. Shooter? I'm there. That's what I was thinking when I saw the trailer for Friends vs. Friends during the Gamescom stream today.
We got a first look at the game through song, which told us a bit about what to expect. From the looks of it, you'll be fighting against friends, although it's unclear whether that means your in-universe friends or real-life ones. You can play online with 1v1 or 2v2 combat, either with friends or other players online. With such a fun art style, though, I'm usually always on board for indies like this to get a look at what it's all about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W06-Ff9r0cY
Friends vs. Friends will be releasing on PC and consoles, and it's available to wishlist now on Steam. The game is being published by Raw Fury, who have a pretty awesome track record with indie games, so I have hope that this'll be a fun little romp.
We don't have any sort of release date yet, so we'll have to be patient on that front. I'm always itching for a new shooter to try out, so this is one that I'll be looking forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anakin Skywalker doesn't like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.
Deck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.]]></summary>

Beyond that, I'm not sure I can say anything. Developers Build A Rocket Boy describe it as "an original multi-world experience" that "will blend gameplay, adventure, creativity, and discovery in a space that blurs the line between reality and the digital world".
So it will probably be either like Roblox or like Second Life, then? Hopefully we'll get a greater sense of which by the time it's out, which will be in 2023. The teaser trailer is a montage of stuff happening quickly in the shape of the logo.

Unknown Worlds, the makers of Natural Selection and Subnautica, are making something a little different once again. Moonbreaker is a new game, set in a new universe, that's all about tactical battles with minis.
Shown off during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022, Moonbreaker is a turn-based sci-fi strategy game with mini-figure battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTVMlxz7h4M
Players put together a crew and captain, and then battle each other in strategy bouts. Unknown Worlds describes it as quick to pick up, hard to put down. You'll also accrue Unit Mastery over time, and have the chance to unlock more units the more you play.
Unknown Worlds also got some help in putting together the universe for Moonbreaker. Mistborn author Brandon Sanderson worked with Unknown Worlds to create the original universe for Moonbreaker.
Paint the figs
As a turn-based strategy fan, there's already a lot to like here. But what really got me about this was the customization options behind the mini-figs. Moonbreaker will have an option to paint all the figures in your army, adding a little bit of extra flair to your crew.

If any of this looks appealing to you, it won't be long until you get to check it out. Moonbreaker goes into Early Access on September 29. And if even that is too far off, there will also be a few free preview sessions available before the Early Access launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True or dare
From the minds of studio Round8 Studio and publisher Neowiz, comes a bizarre-looking but very intriguing game called Lies of P — shown off again at the Gamescom Opening Night Live stream today. As an action-adventure game with a crazy post-apocalyptic steampunk world, this is instantly going to be popping up on some radars, if it hasn't already. In fact, I kind of just forgot about it for a while.
In any case, we have more to go off of than the prior early gameplay and the promising story trailer. Now we have more cold hard footage. While it's hard to truly tell how the innards of an action game work until you're actually playing it (and the framerate is revealed and laid bare), it's promising so far. I mean even if the action bits aren't up to snuff, the story seems like it'll go to some cool places. That's the hope anyway! Maybe they can nail both; they have plenty of time to get it right.

As for updated Lies of P platforms as of August 2022, Round8 lists PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Game Pass support is in, and it's due in 2023. If you're interested, there are semi-regular updates on Twitter from the team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming in 2023 from Parallel Studio and Quantic Dream
One of the more solemn reveals at Gamescom Opening Night Live was Under the Waves, an underwater narrative adventure game from Parallel Studio and publisher Quantic Dream. We've seen plenty of underwater games before, but nothing quite like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCN5sQHaRGg
There's a reason for the quiet, lonely vibe. Here's the story setup:
"Set in the depths of the North Sea in a techno-futuristic 1970s, professional diver Stan is struggling to overcome a life-changing loss and embrace a new future."
"The isolation of the deep sea is a fitting manifestation of his state of mind, and as Stan retreads further into his self-imposed solitude, he starts to experience strange events far beneath the waves. He will eventually have to make a difficult choice... stay lost in the depths forever, or break free to the surface and to the rest of his life."
That all matches the reveal trailer — but what about game mechanics? Under the Waves will have a submarine, as well as swimming, and you'll journey through "caves, wrecks, and submerged plants in search of backstory pieces, salvageable waste, collectibles, and more." I wouldn't have expected craftable equipment. We'll see how involved it is.
Under the Waves is coming to PC (Steam and the Epic Games Store), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in 2023.

Eager point 'n' click fans awaiting the return of the Monkey Island franchise will be pleased to hear that the seafaring adventure series has set a date for its grand comeback. As revealed by Devolver Digital at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Return to Monkey Island will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on September 19, which is, incidentally, "Talk Like a Pirate Day"!
Players can pre-order the title now on both platforms, which will give them access to exclusive in-game Horse Armor. Here's the big ol' joke: It Doesn't Actually Do Anything. Still, if you fancy having an item hanging around your inventory in true LucasArts fashion — then be sure to get your pre-order locked in right now.
Series creator Ron Gilbert said that he's "totally going to pre-order [the game] to get Stan's sweet sweet horse armor. You'd think as a dev I could just hack it in, but it doesn't work that way. NDA's, physics, programming, math, bla, bla, bla."
Co-writer/designer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Tearaway), and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge) are also on board for Return to Monkey Island.

It’s an oversimplification, but if the idea captures your imagination, you recognize why the developers at Unknown Worlds think they’ve hit on something special. Best known for Subnautica, the team has been quietly working on a wholly digital miniatures game for the last five years. Built to emulate the collectability, customization, and tactical sophistication of the best tabletop miniature games, Moonbreaker aims to nail the magic and appeal of the real-life hobby, but with some of the approachability inherent to video games. After over an hour checking out the result, I’m convinced Unknown Worlds is onto something.

Just, your best guess, or the squid'll getcha with its weird alien ink. Ready? Go!.... Okay, well congratulations to anyone who said "a turn-based strategy game inspired by tabletop miniatures". Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.
I admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a tease a few days ago
After a vague tease of what seemed to be an arena mode for Dying Light 2, we now have a better look at Dying Light 2: Bloody Ties, the upcoming DLC that's due out on October 13.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P__9KlbaUHM
This is what we can expect come October:
"In Bloody Ties, players will embark on a new story adventure, you will reach the epicenter of death, wealth and absolute splendor in a stunning location; The Carnage Hall. This old opera building is full of challenges and quests, surprising new weapon types, character interactions, and discoveries to uncover."

While some feared that it would be relegated to an arena romp, a "new story adventure" with "challenges and quests" does sound promising, and the Thunderdome setup is just perfect for zombie media. Dying Light 2: Bloody Ties arrives roughly eight months after the launch of the original.
Perhaps more importantly, as it impacts the game as a whole, the team also shared a massive amount of quality of life updates that are due out today on PC (console updates are being submitted as we speak). You can view those in the tweet below. Big things include enhanced PC hardware support, as well as more enemies roaming the map (that seems huge!). All of these are billed as "community-requested updates."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe we'll get confirmation today at Gamescom?
[Update: Yep! Gamescom did in fact give us a Sonic Frontiers release date, and reconfirmed the November 8 timeline in the official trailer below.]
After months of wondering, we might have a Sonic Frontiers release date finally — thanks to an ad from Sega, no less!
Spotted by Twitter user Nibel, a new YouTube ad for Sonic Frontiers just went live, and was promptly taken down. At the very end of it: a release date! November 8, 2022 could be when we'll finally see what Sonic Frontiers is made of.
This is very likely an early trigger-pull on a Gamescom announcement. The Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony is today, and a Sonic Frontiers showing was already confirmed. It's a safe bet that we could see this same date confirmation today.
As for the Sonic Frontiers release date itself, it's going to be a busy month! Harvestella is due right before it, Skull and Bones is out on the same day, and God of War Ragnarok is debuting the day after. Just 10 days later, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will arrive. It's February 2022 all over again!
That said, with the universal appeal of Sonic, it should be able to push through a lot of the immediate competition as counter-programming of sorts. The release of Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix show, could help put everyone in a general state of Sonic fever as well. A leak from a Sonic movie producer hints at a possible December release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a super in-depth look at Sonic Frontiers earlier this summer when I traveled to Sonic Team and played the game for more than three hours. Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.
Revealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.


Sega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer's Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.
Sonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8. For more in-depth Sonic Frontiers coverage, head to our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

Lords of the Fallen is back, with a reboot of the action RPG dubbed The Lords of the Fallen. The new game is targeting PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.
Shown off during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live, the new adventure takes place more than a thousand years after the events of the original game.
The Lords of the Fallen has a massive world, over five times larger than the original according to developer Hexworks. It will have a bunch of RPG elements, including a narrative filled with characters and quests.

New lords in town
Though there is create-a-character and a single-player campaign, players will also be able to invite another person over for uninterrupted online co-op.
"The Lords of the Fallen is the spiritual successor fans of the original title have always wanted," said creative director Cezar Virtosu in a press release. "The game is significantly larger, with a vast, interconnected dual world split between the realms of the living and dead, that players can explore alone or with friends. It's darker and more challenging, with faster soulslike combat, stronger thematic, richer narrative, deeper RPG systems, and more immersive storytelling.
Hexworks is using Unreal Engine 5, and designing exclusively for the newer generation of consoles and PC.
No date has been set yet.

We're in something of a couch co-op revival, with awesome games in the genre out now, including Overcooked, It Takes Two, and Escape Academy. Now, another beloved co-op game is getting a well-deserved sequel in Moving Out 2.
Moving in real life is one of the most stressful things you can do, but in game form, it provides all kinds of zany fun for you and your friends.
The adorable physics-based moving simulator will get more than 50 new levels and challenges, and for the first time, players will be able to play in online multiplayer with crossplay in addition to the local co-op mode. There will also be a whole host of new characters to interact with, and the developers are introducing an Assist Mode to "welcome movers of all abilities."

Moving Out 2 was announced during the Gamescom stream today, where we got a first look at the new trailer. All we know so far is that the game is coming in 2023 with no further details on the release date, but it is coming to pretty much every platform, including PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol graced the cover of our magazine a few months ago and is currently one of the most anticipated games of the year. Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” 


Protagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. 
In the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.
The Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.]]></summary>

The trailer was revealed during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and while it didn't feature much by way of gameplay, it did give us plenty of new glimpses of magic. In particular, it showed us that we might have access to unforgivable curses such as the Cruciatus Curse in the game. Crucio is essentially a curse that allows you to torture whomever or whatever you use it on – it's very much of the Dark Arts side of magic and as the name suggests, hard to forget and even harder to forgive in the world of Harry Potter.

New Tales from the Borderlands was announced today at the Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, and it has a date — a soonish date, at that. Pre-orders are up today, and it's coming to PC (Epic Games Store), PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on October 21, 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8688wNaRnD0
Gearbox is calling New Tales from the Borderlands a "standalone adventure." This new tale will deal with a "planetary invasion, a vault monster, and cold-hearted capitalists," complete with the classic choose your own adventure conceit. It'll also be a personal story of three people. Here's the setup, which has garnered an M rating from the ESRB:
"Within the perpetually war-torn metropolis of Promethea, players will decide the fates of three underdogs out to make mayhem their business, with altruistic scientist Anu, her ambitious 'streetwise' brother Octavio, and the fierce, frogurt-flinging Fran."

Pre-orders will come with cosmetics for the core trio, 10,000 in-game currency (big question mark here), and an in-game FL4K collectible: that's $40 for the standard edition. For $50, you can get the deluxe edition (which is available in physical form) and grants you Tales from the Borderlands on top of the new entry.
It's weird seeing all these Telltale games come back, but the hope is that if they're split between multiple studios they'll fare better. At the end, Telltale was putting out a lot of stuff, and not all of it was up to par.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spice world
Funcom lifted the lid on Dune: Awakening, an open-world survival MMO, at Gamescom Opening Night Live. While the trailer is cinematic, the first details sound like devious fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anZtoPo2Fpw
According to Funcom, you'll be able to "hunt for spice blooms and deploy your harvester, then protect it from opportunistic raiders and rival factions," with battles shifting "seamlessly from foot to vehicles and from ground to ornithopters in the sky."
The all-important Arrakis will be shared with "thousands of players." Expect player-led factions, shelters, and even fortresses, set against the backdrop of spice and sandworms.
And in terms of source material, Funcom says this game "takes inspiration from both Frank Herbert's novels and Denis Villeneuve's Academy Award-winning film while exploring exciting new possibilities in the franchise." As someone who left the theater sad that it was already over, I'm ready for Dune: Part Two, and I'd be into a good video game adaptation, in theory. Survival MMOs can be a tough sell, though. That said, I'm far more open to this than, say, Conan Exiles. I can picture having a good time with the right group.
If you want to start scheming, there's a beta sign-up on the official site.
Dune: Awakening is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening was announced today during Gamescom's Opening Night Live event. While details on the game are scant, the trailer revealed it's an open-world MMO, and a beta sign-up is available now. 
The trailer tells us little to nothing about the game. It shows a character staring down onto a vast desert while narration waxes poetic about overcoming fear. Then, a giant sandworm comes forth from the ground below, and our character jumps down to face the gigantic beast. Check out the trailer below:


While the trailer didn't reveal much, a press release distributed after the fact did. Here's what it had to say:

Dune: Awakening isn't the only game coming out on the heels of last year's mega-blockbuster Dune adaptation. Back in April, Dune: Spice Wars, a real-time strategy game, was released in early access.  
Awakening is expected on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With over three million copies sold, 2014's Lords of the Fallen was destined for a sequel. Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.
Set one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative." The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of "devastating magic."
While we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market. What are you hoping to see from the sequel? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

Everywhere’s reveal trailer showed a montage of disparate gameplay and art styles, from more cartoony racing to sci-fi to realistic human characters. As its name implies, Everywhere hopes to offer a variety of experiences both user-created and otherwise. Its newly launched website offers this description:
“Everywhere seamlessly blends gameplay, adventure, creativity and discovery in an all-new multi-world gaming experience that redefines how players connect with one another and with the digital world around them.”
“Our intent has always been to push the boundaries of what a videogame can be while still delivering an innovative player-first experience,” said Benzies. “The team we’ve built and the partners we’ve made since our founding are coalescing around the unique vision we’re bringing to life. It’s exciting to be a part of, and we can’t wait to reveal more about Everywhere in coming months.”
Everywhere is slated to arrive in 2023, though no platforms were specified.]]></summary>

A mysterious floating city, estranged father figure and sword-wielding combat are but three of the features that seem to run throughout Vernal Edge — the pixel art Metroidvania soon to come to Switch — and this level of mystery has certainly piqued our interest.
Following a successful Kickstarter campaign, publisher PID Games has taken to Twitter to announce that Hello Penguin's sword-slashing family drama would be coming soon to Switch. The announcement also saw the reveal of a console trailer which shows the game's mechanics in action.

That’s along with a host of changes coming to the core game experience.
Lightfall will arrive on February 28, 2023. The expansion represents the “beginning of the end” of the Light and Darkness Saga that has been unfolding for many years now.

On September 17, Destiny 2 invades Fall Guys with Guardian-inspired cosmetics, spicy ramen celebration emote, and other accessories.

We are rapidly approaching the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Kart's Japanese release on the Super Famicom, but what if we told you that there is another SMK-adjacent anniversary happening today? We are, of course, talking about the Super Mario Kart Championships, which will be racing off the start line today in its 20th year of competition.
Ten years after the SNES game introduced us to the joys of competitive plumber racing, the Championship was formed to provide a yearly reminder of who the best driver really is. It has since continued this love of the original game, with its focus always remaining on the SNES franchise-starter instead of the series' newer additions. With events split across time trials, battle modes, match races and the 150cc Grand Prix, the leaderboard is formed and topped only by those who can compete at the highest level across all competitions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nintendo Treehouse Live is set to air this week, and it will focus on fleshing out more of Splatoon 3's offerings and provide a new look at the upcoming Harvestella. The event takes place on Thursday, August 25, at 9:30 a.m. Pacific/12:30 p.m. Eastern and airs on Nintendo's YouTube channel. 
Splatoon 3, which recently had a dedicated Direct presentation, gets another spotlight focusing on its single-player campaign. Nintendo promises a “deep-dive” look at the story mode, which has only been lightly touched on up to this point. Additionally, the presentation will unveil the arenas available in the Splatfest World Premiere demo that goes live on August 27.
We’ll also see fresh gameplay for Harvestella, Square Enix’s promising-looking action RPG meets farming simulator that arrives to Switch (and PC) on November 4. 
Get ready for a Nintendo Treehouse: Live presentation on 8/25 at 9:30am PT featuring 3 segments:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Livin' La Viada Loca.
After launching on PC earlier this year, JFI Games’ Dusk Diver 2 has made its way to consoles three years after the original game. While Dusk Diver was seen as a solid foundation, it lacked in several departments. Sadly, while Dusk Diver 2 makes some steps in the right direction, it comes with a host of its own problems that hold it back from being great.
A musou-style action RPG, Dusk Diver 2 takes place in the district of Ximending in Taipei and puts you in the shoes of Yang Yumo one year after the events of the first game, as she struggles to fully get to grips with her newfound dragon vein power. Yumo and the crew at Tumaz Mart (now joined by Nemea, the antagonist of the original game) are now dealing with any lingering dimensional fissures from Youshanding, the otherworldly version of Ximending and home to the chaos beasts.

Although I spent the latter half of last week playing and performance testing it, the worst I saw in terms of bugs, glitches and unintentional chicanery was one temporarily floating pedestrian and a few de-synced execution animations. Only after I committed this clean(ish) bill of health to writing did the game’s wider playerbase discover that it is, in fact, riddled with issues: some benign and hilarious, others irritating and game-breaking. Well fine then, game.
Some of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle. Then there’s former vid bud Colm (RPS in peace), who has found his feet pinned to a car roof before fading away like Marty McFly if his parents split up.

The Treehouse will be split into three segments; the first two will focus on Splatoon 3 — one part on the game's new single-player mode, and the second on what strategies you can use in the upcoming Splatfest World Premier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a recent Instagram post on the official PlayStation account, we can finally pin down a launch period for the highly-anticipated PSVR2: "Coming early 2023." You can see the corresponding tweet below.
Coming early 2023. #PSVR2 pic.twitter.com/R3MwWVPyNt
August 22, 2022
While the announcement is relatively brief, we do know PSVR2 will release with over 20 major first-party and third-party games, including new titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and ports of Resident Evil Village, No Man's Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2. Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we're talking two different modes of visual fidelity. 
According to our very own Marcus Stewart, "VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate."
PSVR2 drops in early 2023, with a specific date to be announced at some point in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To call the current state of the world today ‘tumultuous’ would be a bit of an understatement. For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?


People who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling ("more spooky than outright horror," as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.

The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens.

Well, if the answer is "some more", then there were a handful of extra details in a developer livestream this evening.

In Madden NFL 23, developer EA Tiburon focused on the fundamentals: authentic 11v11 football and cleaning up many of the bugs that plagued previous Madden iterations. The result is a small step forward for the franchise and a strong foundation to build on.
The most significant changes in Madden NFL 23 are under the surface. The team at EA calls it FieldSense, a shift to more physics-based interactions on the field. In practice, it’s a mostly positive change. Running the ball between bodies is chaotic and violent, true to the real-world g…]]></summary>

While Deep Silver Volition’s “what if millennials, but crime” reboot is colourful and often quite pretty, you can tell it’s not nearly as interested in cutting edge visuals or contemporary PC tech trappings as the Spidey remaster is. Ray tracing? Yes but only for ambient occlusion. Upscaling? Never heard of it, officer.
The upside - besides Santo Ileso being a generally nice place to visit, as Alice Bee found in her Saints Row review - is that it's playable on low-end and luxury hardware alike. And, to its credit, there's a healthy list of customisable graphics options too. I’ve therefore embraced the past, and spent hours in testing to find out how you can tweak Saints Row’s settings for the best possible performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a long-standing theory among the Warhammer community that the chaos wastes at the globe’s south pole house a peculiar breed of beastmen in the form of evil, monstrous penguins. The theory is based on a world with similar geography to our own, and the tendency of the ruinous powers to morph local fauna into mockeries of their previous forms. No ping-gors show themselves as I trawl the southern wastes as stealthy chameleon-skink Oxyotl, but I find myself thinking about them all the same. Noot for the noot god, the blasted crags seem to whisper. Fish for the fish throne.
Evil penguins or not, all things seem possible with Immortal Empires, the combined landmass of the Total War: Warhammer trilogy into a single sandbox map, vast and varied in its climates, landmarks, and inhabitants. Creative Assembly have already dug deep into dusty stacks of White Dwarf to flesh out footnotes into full factions, and as the list of obvious additions dwindle, things can only get wilder and more creative. For now, we have one very big map stuffed with each faction and lord from three massive strategy games, creaking and occasionally buckling under the weight of its own promise. But it works. There’s a breadth of technical and balance issues still to solve, but the Immortal Empires beta is substantially more stable, playable, and enjoyable than I dared to hope it would be for at least another six months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Saints Row series started off as a sort of rival to Grand Theft Auto, an action-adventure crime sim about working your way up the ranks of a street gang to become the boss. It quickly diverged to become less realistic and more impossibly bombastic, and niched down into giant dildo bats, aliens, reincarnation, and so on. The series has gone to outer space and to hell, so if you're rebooting the series that doesn't leave you many places to go except... backwards.
Saints Row (2022 edition) is back to being a sort of Saints Row again, but also still trying to appeal to people who loved the characters and dick jokes and cartoon carnage of the Saints Row of 2013. If I was being reductive, I'd say it's Saints Row by way of Watch Dogs 2. It isn't bad. It's fun, in fact, but it isn't really doing anything new, either, and I think that's a shame.

The Saints Row reboot features a new cast of characters and a different location to explore, but its heart and soul haven’t changed: Players can once again expect an exciting crime fest, giggle-worthy humor, purple splattered everywhere, and an open-world chock full of things to do and secrets to unearth. The game also has a knack for blowing everything up. In other words, it is great fun in that traditional Saints Row way and even better when experienced with a friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known HBO have been making a TV adaptation of everyone's favourite grim zombie apocalypse The Last Of Us for some time now, but aside from a few leaks and still images, we haven't actually seen it in action yet - until now. Late last night, HBO released the first official footage from the show, showing Pedro Pascal's Joel giving some serious lip to Bella Ramsey's Ellie, as well as a very quick peek at Bill, played by Nick Offerman. Slated to arrive sometime on our tellyboxes next year, have a watch of the trailer below.

        <updated>2022-08-22T12:22:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, and it showcases a new pocket monster and a few new moves targeted at the competitive play community. 
Released as the finale to the Pokémon World Championship held in London (watch our vlog of it here) over the past few days, the trailer is focused on battles, which makes sense given the nature of the event. In it, we get a look at a new Pokémon, Cyclizar, which looks very reminiscent of the two primary legendaries of this generation, Koraidon and Miraidon. Koraidon is the Scarlet legendary, and it seems rooted in the past whereas Miraidon, the Violet legendary, seems very futuristic. Perhaps Cyclizar represents the present. Only time will tell. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Beyond Cyclizar, the trailer also reveals a few new moves and items: 
Move: Shed Tail – Create a substitute, then swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting. 
Move: Tera Blast – Changes type when the user has Terastalized.
Item: Loaded Dice – Makes multistrike moves more likely to hit more times. 
Item: Mirror Herb  – Copies an opponent's stat increases when consumed. 

For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out this preview detailing everything we recently learned about the Paldea region, new pocket monsters, and Terastalizing. Watch this trailer that welcomes trainers to the Paldea region of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then check out all the new Pokémon we spotted in that trailer. 
Are you excited about these new moves or do you think they're too disruptive to the meta of competitive play? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO dropped the first glimpse of footage from its upcoming series, The Last of Us, in a surprise promotional trailer yesterday. 
The trailer runs roughly two minutes and it features new looks at shows like Succession, The White Lotus, House of the Dragon, and more. But then, at the 1:40-min mark, the trailer transitions its hype to The Last of Us. It's clear HBO is aware how excited people are for this series as it's given its own extended spotlight in the trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, not only do we get our first glimpse of footage from The Last of Us, but we also get to hear Bella Ramsey's Ellie for the first time as well as Pedro Pascal's Joel (and both are saying some pretty iconic lines from the game). What's more, we get a look at Nick Offerman's Bill and a quick shot of a clicker (well, a dead one that's grown to become part of a wall). 
Here are some screenshots from the trailer if you're after a closer look:

If you're rearing to jump back into the world of The Last of Us, good news: The Last of Us Part 1, a remake of the game this HBO series is based on, hits PlayStation 5 and PC this September. Check out this new trailer that compares The Last of Us Part 1 with the original game after that.

The issue was first spotted in the early hours of this morning, which prevented players from participating in a time-limited event known as Rebirth Of Clemency and rolling for new items and characters. Hotta Studio have assured players it should all be sorted now, though, and that they can expect to receive their next bundle of freebies in the coming hours.

Plus, if you stick to the very end, you'll still get to see a new horrible monster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. 
Desiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. 
Sporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what it's like at the beginning of a new year. You're all excited about the many tens and hundreds of new video games coming out over the next 12 months, and you go and make a big list of all the ones you're really looking forward to. We did exactly that back in January of this year, coming up with a list of our 43 most anticipated games of 2022. Lately, though, it seems we can't go a single day without word of yet another game being delayed, whether it's just by a couple of months, or that it's been taken off the calendar entirely.
It got me thinking. How many of those 43 games are even still on the table this year? And, more importantly, what does that mean for RPS as we head into the back-end of 2022? Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus was the best-selling game in the U.S. last month, despite being a free-to-play title, due to its premium Founder’s Pack. 
The Founder’s Packs for MultiVersus came in three forms: a $39.99 standard edition, a $59.99 Deluxe edition, and a $99.99 Premium edition. These packs could be purchased to grant players things like character tokens for instant fighter unlocks, exclusive banners, and the premium in-game currency, Gleamium. It seems these packs sold extremely well in the U.S. as they brought in enough money to make MultiVersus the best-selling title in the U.S. in July, according to the latest NPD numbers.

Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.
I did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.

Once there, players can explore iconic Dragon Ball locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s house, and the Room of Spirit & Time. Plus, players can duke it out in the PvP battle arena, “Tenkaichi Budokai.” 

“We’re thrilled to partner with Epic Games and bring this first-ever Toei Animation franchise integration to Fortnite,” Toei Animation Inc. director of global marketing, Lisa Yamatoya, writes in a press release. “Over the last 36 years, the Dragon Ball franchise has built perhaps the largest global fanbase of any anime. And this multi-generational mainstream audience makes Dragon Ball ideally suited for a collaboration with Fortnite and its worldwide community of players. We’re excited to see the response to Dragon Ball’s arrival in Fortnite.” 
Epic Games notes that, in case you missed it, there are already Dragon Ball creative islands available in the game for you to visit. There are multiple Dragon Ball Super Episode Festival islands, and from now until Sept. 17, you can board a cruise ship and watch select episodes from Dragon Ball Super on them. Both these islands and the new Dragon Ball Adventure island were created by Vysena Studios.

Does the game's combat rule? Yes, without a doubt. But will I continue playing? I'm not so sure. From what I've sampled, one strong pillar might not be enough to hold my attention for much longer.

From their beginnings on the fairway fringes of Flash-game forums, we now have been blessed with a handful of fun indie golf sims. We’ve seen the bizarre buffoonery of What The Golf?, the high-speed, eye-popping courses of Golf With Your Friends, and Secret Mode recently completely threw the clubs out the window and replaced them with highspeed motorcars in Turbo Golf Racing.
It's safe to say that golfing games are always full of shenanigans and Cursed To Golf is no different. Playing as a golfer who has been cast into Golf Purgatory, you need to golf your way back to the land of the living, completing all eighteen holes in one roguelike run. It’s a fun premise and the game bursts with silliness and personality, but unfortunately Cursed To Golf fails to iron out certain roguelike frustrations. After mistiming a shot in the game’s final area and being sent back to the beginning (ending an excruciating four-hour run time), I truly did feel cursed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

A couple of weeks ago, with no new mainline Arkham game since 2015's Arkham Knight, they started discussing Batman: Arkham World, a fourth game in the series that came out in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High On Life, the upcoming first-person shooter from Justin Roiland's Squanch Games, has been delayed. 
Originally due out this October, High On Life will now hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 13, 2022. It joins various other games delayed this week like Planet of Lana and Evil West, and for a similar reason: the team needs more time to make this game the best it can be. 
Here's the studio's statement about the delay, in full: 
"We have good news and bad news. Feel free to choose the option you'd prefer to read first; we won't meddle with your free will. 
The Good News: High On Life is still coming in 2022! The team at Squanch Games is working hard towards developing the best gaming experience to hit your screens, and a little extra time to squash some bugs never hurts. With that in mind, our new launch date is set to December 13, 2022. 
The Bad News: It's a game delay, sorry! Because we're making you wait an additional 6-ish weeks, please accept the linked animation as an apology. 
"High On Life will be available via Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows PCs, Day One on Xbox Game Pass, PC Game Pass, and through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Thank you for your continued patience and support." 
As for the linked animation mentioned in the statement above, it's what you can watch below: 
While you wait for High On Life, please find this 500 pound, diaper-wearing alien a wife. Please. He won't leave me alone.

August 18, 2022
As you can see, it's very Justin Roiland. Enjoy!

That’s a fun headline to read, right? And it’s true because after teasing earlier this week that Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding was coming to PC Game Pass, Xbox announced that it hits the service next week. 
More specifically, Death Stranding will hit PC Game Pass next Tuesday, Aug. 23. Now, this might be somewhat surprising for those not caught up on Death Stranding’s journey from PlayStation 4, to PlayStation 5, and then PC. Sony and PlayStation funded Kojima Productions’ development of Death Stranding, and it’s a PlayStation intellectual property. 
However, a PC port was published by 505 Games, and it seems 505 Games and Kojima Productions are free to determine the whereabouts of the PC port of this game. As such, it’s now coming to PC Game Pass, a service owned by…]]></summary>

This was nothing to do with the file itself; even being near another laptop playing the song could cause a crash. According to Microsoft, one of the sonic frequencies in Rhythm Nation coincided with the natural resonant frequencies of a particular laptop hard drive, making it crash. Amazing. Perfect. A perfect bug.

The group of bounty hunters gathers in their favorite bar once more. For the first time, protagonist Ringo pays attention to the lush cherry blossom decoration over the rooftop. Her friends say the real ones are even more beautiful and laugh at the idea of a bunch of Devil Summoners having a picnic and watching the flowers. The friendly mockery leads to a funny yet endearing message: “I think we oughta show Ringo the fun side of being human, don’t you?” Sadly, Soul Hackers 2 doesn’t seem to agree with the sentiment.

And yet, I am delighted by a new Doom mod which replaces all the sprites for enemies and items with new 3D forms. The secret is voxels, carefully recreating those old 2D sprites in 3D pixels. It's pretty great, in a 'makes the game actually look the way I had remembered it' sort of way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is arguably one of the most anticipated games locked behind the fiery gates of development hell. The first game dropped over a decade ago, and ever since, zombie-slaying fans have yearned for a sequel. Well, they're in luck. A Dead Island 2: Day One Edition positing was spotted on Amazon with box art, in-game photos, and a 2023 release date. The new info was taken down, but we made sure to grab the images and extra deets for you. 
According to the info on the Amazon page, Dead Island 2 will be available on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. However, current-gen versions of the game don't have web pages yet. The story follows an elite squad that's immune to the infection, meaning we'll be seeing 8-player co-op when the game drops. The full summary reads as follows:
Players must craft zany weapons like in the first game to defeat the seemingly never-ending hordes plaguing the West Coast. Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios' gory adventure allegedly launches on February 3, 2023 (or at least that's what appeared on the listings earlier today before suddenly disappearing). Hopefully, this date holds up/reemerges as we move into the new year.

        <updated>2022-08-18T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inkulinati is a imagiative strategy game first announced in 2020 that brings the distinct art of medieval manuscripts to life. The game unfolds within the parchment itself as players control humans, animals, and mythical creatures to battle it out in turn-based battles that are equal parts thoughtful and ridiculous. Inkulinati has looked promising every time it’s made an appearance, and we can finally see how it's shaping up thanks to an upcoming early access launch. 
This winter, players can dive into Inkulinati on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. The game puts you in the role of Inkulinati, a being capable of using the magical Living Ink to bring illustrations to life. The irreverent battles unfold within an open book as players command units to strategically slice, bludgeon, and even fart opponents into submission to clear the way and topple the opposing Inkulinati. 


In addition to recruiting humans, rabbits, cats, snails, and other critters, you can enlist the aid of real-life literary figures such as Dante Alighieri. Each unit sports its own unique traits with more team members unlocked by playing. Stages promote different playstyles, with some requiring a more tactical approach and others a more aggressive assault. The game features a single-player campaign, and you can challenge friends in 1-on-1 battles.
And for those wondering: yes, this is a different game than Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's recently announced narrative adventure game that shares the same artistic influences.  
Inkulinati will be available first on Xbox and PC, but a Switch version is also planned with other platforms in consideration. The game will be playable at the Xbox booth during Gamescom next week.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix have made a vast array of RPGs over the years, but rarely have they ventured into the realm tactics and strategy games. A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. 
Happily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new interview sheds light on Just Cause developer Avalanche Studio's canceled open-world Iron Man game, rumored to be in the works a decade ago before getting axed in 2012. 
MinnMax's Ben Hanson interviewed Christofer Sundberg, co-founder of Avalance, who has since left the studio to start a new company, Liquid Sword. During the interview, Hansen asked Sundberg about the fate of the Iron Man project, which Sundberg revealed as being in development for a year and a half to two years before being canceled due to what he describes as "company politics."


Sundberg reveals that Disney wanted Avalanche to rapidly expand its staff to finish the game under a shortened development timeline. However, he refused, explaining that doing so would have put a massive strain on the studio.

Open up this metal box, put a graphics card inside, and suddenly any PC or laptop you connect to it via Thunderbolt gets a substantial upgrade in gaming prowess.

The Lenovo Legion BoostStation can handle GPUs up to 300W (think an Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti or AMD RX 6800 XT), and is available for just £93 when you use the code BANK15 to knock 15% off the price at Ebay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another one bites the dust. If you haven't noticed, a number of high-profile delays have occurred in recent weeks, with many upcoming games pushed into next year. Unfortunately, the promising sci-fi platformer Planet of Lana joins that growing hit list.
Planet of Lana was first announced at E3 2021 with a 2022 launch window. The game stars Lana, a young girl, and her adorable cat-like companion Mui on a combat-free mission to preserve a serene planet occupied by robots and other creatures from corruption. Developer Wishfully Studios wants this cinematic puzzle platformer to make a big splash, announcing it’s pushing the release to spring 2023 to do so. 
Planet of Lana will be playable at Gamescom next week, so attendees have the opportunity to see how the game is shaping up first-hand. The title is slated to launch on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.
If you're losing track of every big game to slip into 2023, this handy list should serve as a nice reminder.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.
We Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
