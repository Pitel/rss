        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for some time now that The Elder Scrolls 6 would be built in Creation Engine 2, the very same game engine that powers Starfield. Whether that's a good thing, nobody can currently tell, but a former Bethesda game designer has recently discussed this topic in an interview.


Speaking with VideoGamer, Bruce Nesmith, who worked as the lead designer of Skyrim and the systems designer for Starfield, explained a few things. Notably, his point is that Bethesda's Creation Engine has been specifically fine-tuned to deliver the kind of sandbox RPG that the company is known for. To that end, it doesn't seem like there are any plans to move on over to Unreal Engine 5. This should, hopefully, put such discussions to bed.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's worker cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up in the air.
Europa is a puzzle-platformer that’s light on puzzles and platforming, set on (and named after) the moon of Jupiter. This indie title from Novadust Entertainment and Future Friends Games combines pretty expanses of green with futuristic elements. Its playthrough and story aim to both rouse your inner child and give you philosophical food for thought. Generally, all these things could make for a good game. But while none fail here, none really excel either.
As the game takes off, you hear the voice of your father, inviting you to Europa "if you ever get lonely." You take control of Zee, an android in the form of a young boy who totters past Adam’s gravestone (the father in question) to explore the land. You get a jetpack which you use to hover and glide through each area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Europa is a beautiful indie gem with its illustrious visuals and environmental storytelling. While the gameplay might be lacking in some parts, the narrative journey certainly makes up for this aspect. 


This game tells an emotional story with stellar voice acting from the narrator Earl Fisher, who plays the kid protagonist's father. As we continue through the game, we get more information about the lore by picking up notes, and the plot has a great flow with twists and turns towards the end. It also tells an environmental message but it doesn't strike at the heart enough to be effective.

That being said, here are all the locations of these statues in the Vessel of Hatred expansion.


All Tenets of Akarat locations in Diablo 4


To start, we’ll show you all the Tenets of Akarat locations by subregion to make it easier. Each area contains five Tenets, so it’ll be easy to track which ones you’re missing. 


It’ll also be easier if you set the game to a lower difficulty to prevent mobs from getting in the way.

A pure technical analysis would conclude that it has the fidelity of an early Nintendo Switch game at best, and yet anyone whose heart flickers with even the tiniest ember of sentiment will instantly fall in love with its lavish pause screen animations. Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

This announcement was made in this week's issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump (and was later reported by Shōnen Jump News on Twitter/X). But the most noteworthy part is that Season 8 will be the final season of the My Hero Academia anime, which shouldn't be a surprise considering that the original manga by Kohei Horikoshi recently reached its conclusion as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no shortage of throwback beat 'em up games, and there's certainly no shortage of new games being made for old consoles. In the case of Vengeance Hunters, though, developer Nalua Studio has its sights set on a classic platform that doesn't get as much attention: Neo Geo. 


While the side-scrolling brawler was developed with SNK's arcade/home system — specifically the Neo Geo AES, the home console version you might remember as being prohibitively expensive — it also has a date for current platforms. The colorful throwback side-scroller is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam on October 28, 2024.


If this is your first time reading about Vengeance Hunters, here's a quick minute-long look at its characters and how their beatdowns look in action:




True to its Neo Geo roots, actually purchasing a physical copy of Vengeance Hunters on its intended platform is going to cost you. The standard version is priced at 349 Euros (about US$$382), with the special and limited editions set at 429 Euros (US$469). Folks who were lucky (and wealthy) enough to grow up paying out the nose for Neo Geo cartridges likely won't flinch, but this is a niche market nestled further within an even more niche market.


Price aside, it's still cool to see someone making new Neo Geo games in 2024. Thankfully, it's not the only option for this one, because Vengeance Hunters looks like a lot of fun! There's a badass brawler named Candy, a top-heavy robot named Golem, and a rowdy, robot-armed hoss named Loony. The animation looks decent and the bosses are suitably screen-filling. We'll see how it plays, with or without the pricey cart in hand, later this month.

Valve's designers and engineers spoke about the Deck's Australian release with Press Start in a recent interview where they explained what this meant for the company's presence in the land down under.

The developer offered a look at an upcoming PvE Operation that is set to arrive sometime this October. While there wasn't a ton of information provided, we did get a screenshot of the locale and a briefing on where the mission would take players.


Though Space Marine 2 is primarily a single-player game, it offers a cooperative PvE mode called Operations beyond its campaign. It functions almost like a second campaign, following a squad of Space Marines working in tandem with Titus, Gadriel, and Chairon. Saber Interactive previously noted that it had plans to add Operations and additional content to Space Marine 2, and now we're seeing the first fruits of that labor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a date!
Our interest was piqued when Team17 and Sassy Chap Games announced Date Everything — a game where you can, fittingly, date everything — earlier this year. This sim was initially supposed to release this month, but now the team has announced that it's being pushed back to 14th February 2025 instead.
As outlined in the new trailer (above), the dev is pushing Date Everything's release back by a few months to ensure everything is in tip-top shape for launch. This includes squashing any pesky bugs, tweaking certain areas and making sure all those romance options are as lovely as possible.

If you can’t even remember a Tomb Raider IV, V, or VI, that’s probably because they dropped the numerals after the third game. So what we’re actually talking about is The Last Revelation, Chronicles, and much-maligned The Angel of Darkness. These were the last of the original chronology (and Core Design’s contributions to the series), as the followup to 2003’s The Angel of Darkness was 2006’s Tomb Raider Legends, a reboot of the series.


It’s an interesting trilogy of games, because Core Design had gotten tired of making a new Tomb Raider every year. So, in The Last Revelation, they tried to kill off the character, but Eido…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We may have a long wait until we get our hands on Grand Theft Auto 6, but series fans who miss its old-school style may want to pay attention to The Precinct. The police-focused sandbox game is getting a playable demo next week as part of Steam Next Fest. 


In The Precinct, you play a rookie cop hitting the mean streets of Averno City in a neo-noir-inspired 1980s America. Granted, the premise may not immediately remind you of GTA. The Precinct places you in the shoes of a crime fighter instead of someone who actually does the crimes. Regardless, it could check quite a few boxes for those who love the pre-GTA 3 era of the franchise.


Grimy streets, neon lights, and randomized crime are in full view of an isometric camera that gives you an overhead angle on the game's world. As Nick Cordell Jr., you take to the streets for high-speed car chases and chaotic shootouts. You can drive multiple vehicles in The Precinct, such as a cruiser and a police chopper. That's not bad for a fresh-faced rookie.




The Precinct puts you on the case in its Steam Next Fest demo


The Precinct isn't all about shootouts, mind. It also includes some sleuthing work with evidence-gathering and investigating gang activity. You'll keep busy with the randomly generated crimes, which cover busting down crooks and handing out tickets. 


The game looks intriguing and could be a good way to enjoy classic GTA vibes while we wait for the next installment. I mean, we have to do something over the next year or two (if we're lucky). 





The Precinct will be playable in demo form next week when Steam Next Fest arrives on October 14, 2024. There's no official release date for the game yet, but the developer is planning to launch it before the end of the year.

Now, I've been quite vocal in my displeasure with how the recent Forza games have been handled. Between an annoyingly excessive reliance on FOMO and a dearth of permanent, non-timed content, it wasn't looking good earlier this year. Yet, Turn 10 has managed to turn things around and I'm now happy to say that Forza Motorsport is in a reasonably good spot. Its anniversary celebration, specifically, will be all about custom-built Mustangs and drifting, and I'm hard-pressed to imagine a better coin…]]></summary>

Compiling The Last Revelation, Chronicles and Angel of Darkness, this follow-up collection appears to have the same updated visuals as its predecessor — and the ability to switch between the polygonal and modern styles returns too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rod of Kepeleke is one of the new Unique weapons that have been added to Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred. It’s going to be a very popular pick for all the Spiritborns out there because of its versatility for many top-tier builds right now.


That being said, if you want to get this for your class, here’s what you’ll need to know.


How to get the Rod of Kepeleke in Diablo 4


The Rod of Kepeleke can be obtained by defeating Duriel or Andariel. They are the strongest ladder bosses in the game and can take quite some time to get there, let alone target farm.


If you are far from this point in the game and do want to get the Rod of Kepeleke a lot sooner, there are easier, but less efficient ways of doing so.


The first method is to farm the Infernal Hordes. If you rack up enough Aether, you can open up the big chest in the middle to obtain better rewards. It won’t be guaranteed, but you have a higher likelihood of obtaining one of the many Unique items for your Spiritborn.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can also farm Nightmare Dungeons and The Pit at levels above 35 to consistently gain more Uniques. Once again, it isn’t guaranteed, but better gear starts dropping once you hit higher Torment tiers because of loot modifiers.


One of the better methods aside from those above would be to gamble Obols. That’s right. Gather a lot of Obols, preferably close to your maximum limit, then trade them to a Purveyor of Curiosities. Gamble them specifically for Quarterstaffs.


While you’re at it, allocate any spare Season Blessings to the Urn of Curiosities to increase your chances of getting two weapons for one roll. It’ll heavily increase your chances of getting the weapon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one thing about the original Doom and Doom 2 was they really liked to emphasize the dreary colors to match the guttural 90s violence. Combined with some of the murkier, bloodier hellscape levels, id Software's iconic series is not exactly known for its liberal use of bright colors.


Until now, that is. As you can see, ModDB user DoomMate is currently in the midst of creating a mod for Doom 2 that can only be described as "neon." While it's still a work-in-progress, "Volt Laser" is promising a large selection of custom maps that have taken cues from a more synthwave/cyberpunk aesthetic.




This "megawad" will contain 35 levels, featuring a city, underground, some outskirts, and more. You can see the progress that's been made in the video above, and I, for one, am looking forward to running around maps that have purple floors and teal buttons.


Deus-Doom? System Doom?


As mentioned, "Volt Laser" is still being worked on. Its creator did say they wanted it out by November, but have had to delay releasing the mod due to other commitments. At this time, there's no definite launch day, but it should hopefully be before the end of the year.


However, DoomMate did post recently with some updates from the project, including some more images. I don't know about you, but that skyline in the distance is giving me mad original Deus Ex vibes. Or some other throwback piece of dystopian science fiction.


In any case, I'm here for it. Honestly, I'll be surprised if I ever get bored of seeing Doom mods. We've all played the games to death and I know I go on about fan-made content a lot, but if I had even an iota of investment and talent as a lot of modders do, you wouldn't be reading this article right now.

If you’re reading this on October 11th 2024, then 30 years ago today Final Fantasy 3 (aka VI) was released in North America. A lot of memorable games (Super Metroid, DKC, Earthworm Jim, Ridge Racer, and Doom II, to name a few) turn 30 this year, but Final Fantasy VI stands out to me because I was privileged to play and beat it a couple of months before its official release.
And, no, I didn’t simply import and play the Japanese version that had been released six months prior. In the summer of 1994, as a fresh-faced, 16-year-old kid, I played to completion an official, pre-release build of the English version.

This review was originally published in January 2015. We're updating and republishing it to mark the arrival of GP Legend (and Climax, which was never released in the West) in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GBA library.

The F-Zero series has often dished out a steep challenge, and in GP Legend the uninitiated will be given no quarter unless they dig in their heels and learn the ropes. You're expected to tame every brutal hairpin, memorise each risky shortcut, and etch sweet boosting spots into your brain if you are to succeed.

They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective RPG. Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

Precious few details regarding the project are available at the moment bar a single piece of concept art which you can view below, but the project is said to continue the legacy of Disco Elysium while also introducing a new, groundbreaking ‘psychogeographic RPG’ mechanic. Essentially, it means that your decisions in the game will not only affect the people around you, but also the environment, with your charatcer's psyche constantly shifting with the landscape around you.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

How to get Insurmountable in Destiny 2


Insurmountable, like all of the other Revenant weapons, can be acquired by participating in seasonal events. At the time of this writing, these will be the two Onslaught modes found in The Last City. Additionally, it can be found via rank up rewards from Eido. To maximize this, I recommend equipping four pieces of the seasonal gear as they provide a rep gain bonus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Episode 2: Revenant of Destiny 2 has an incredibly lengthy intro. As your favorite Eliksni make their appearances, you'll be guided through the foundation for how this episode will work. One critical part is performing fieldwork with and for Eido. Yet, finding the Act I Fieldwork tab is surprisingly tricky.


How to access the Act I Fieldwork Tab in Revenant


To access the Act I Fieldwork Tab, speak to Eido in her apothecary in The Last City. It's the green icon with the potion on it. Once accessed, you'll see three categories: Minor Fieldwork, Major Fieldwork, and Key Fieldwork.


Image by Destructoid


The problem many players, including myself, run into at this part is the instructions at the bottom of the screen never go away despite accessing the tab. By the time it appeared for me, I had already acquired the fieldwork and was ready to go. The fix for this bug is as simple as returning to orbit.


This bug has persisted in various forms for the past several years. It's annoying, to be sure, but once you learn to recognize it, the "fix" is easy. It serves as a painful reminder that Bungie leadership doesn't have its priorities straight, and the remaining staff's talents are being misused. 


As for the fieldwork itself, it's fairly simple to complete. The first two involve going to Europa and recovering lost items while laying waste to enemies inside a Lost Sector and completing world tasks. I don't mind any excuse to head back to the frozen moon of Jupiter, especially if I'm wielding what is essentially a frozen stake thrower.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time you embark on a battle in Sparking Zero, you'll collect Proficiency points for a particular character. Although you would think that it boosts a fighter's performance, it's actually used for something else entirely. Here's what you need to know about the Proficiency mechanic in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero.


Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Proficiency, explained


The Proficiency level displays how much you use a character, indicating how "proficient" you are with this fighter. It's basically a way to show off your talents to other Sparking Zero players or spread your love for a favorite of yours. Each character displays a star-symbol progress bar for this system, and you can fill it up gradually by participating in battles. Higher Proficiency levels provide rewards from the Zen-Ohs O…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emblems in Destiny 2 are a great way to stand out from the crowd and give other players a glimpse of what they're getting when you roll into the fireteam. For some, emblems are another thing to collect in a game where FOMO sweetens that chase. So, when the Life for Life emblem was shown off in 2022 with no way to obtain it, some were salivating. Here's how to get it.


Where to get the Life for Life Emblem in Destiny 2


Two years after its release, players can finally obtain the Life for Life emblem by visiting Master Rahool in The Tower. While you're there, make sure to visit the Special Deliveries Terminal for the following rewards (if you've purchased the season pass):

(1) Exotic Cipher


(7) Upgrade Module

The Life for Life emblem was added in February 2022 with Season of the Risen. However, there was a small catch, as the emblem couldn't actually be obtained. Bungie would acknowledge this six months later in a TWAB. Two and a half years later, Bungie finally made good and included the Life for Life emblem.


I'll admit that it took me a hot minute to figure out what the icon in the emblem was. Then I remembered when Crow accidentally killed one of Empress Caiatl's most trusted psions. Ah, good times. It's why Lord Saladin is now bound to the Cabal and goes by the moniker of Valus Forge. So, in a season where we're still cleaning up Uldren Sov's messes, it's humorous that we get a reminder of his reborn self's goofs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I love about Destiny 2 is the way it broadens players' vocabulary through its names for weapons and armor. Revenant's hand cannon, Exuviae, can also be defined as the shed exoskeleton of ecdysozoans. Do the Eliksni shed their carapaces? Who knows? Either way, that's some good food for thought while you chase this hand cannons God Rolls.


How to get Exuviae in Destiny 2


Exuviae can be acquired by completing Revenant seasonal activities. At the time of this writing, those are primarily the new Onslaught modes accessed via The Last City. It also has a chance to appear in rank-up engrams from Eido. Equip the seasonal armor to boost your rep gains with Crabcakes.

The new Silent Hill 2 is gorgeously faithful to the original and more than honors its beautifully harrowing story. With so much reverence at play, it should come as no surprise that it even pays homage to the most accidentally iconic moment in the series.


If you’re into the franchise, you’ll know about the infamous Silent Hill HD Collection from 2012. Long story short, it featured Silent Hill 2 and 3, but the remasters were based on an incomplete beta build, not on the game's incredible final versions. The resulting games were ugly at best and downright unplayable at their worst. One of the funniest aspects of this remaster wa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This feels like the year of stop-motion animation games. Harold Halibut and Judero are about to yield the limelight to The Spirit of the Samurai, confirmed with a December 12, 2024 launch date. Sharpen those swords and ready those warrior cats, folks. 


Wait, warrior cats? That's right. If a harsh and violent samurai Metroidvania with stop-motion-style animation doesn't quite grab your attention (it really should), then know this: There are places where you get to play The Spirit of the Samurai as the viciously adorable warrior cat Chisai. The newest trailer for the game shows Chisai in action, along with its also-cute Kodama partner fighting a grotesque spider.




The Spirit of the Samurai hacks its way to a late 2024 release date


When Chisai isn't being cute and potentially deadly, you will play as the samurai Takeshi, who ventures out to end the Oni rampage. Whereas Chisai is used during climbing and platforming sections, Takeshi must overcome the odds. He does it not by being adorable (sadly) but by killing yokai, Oni, and other demons of Japanese mythology using his katana, bow, and spear. 


The Spirit of the Samurai is a dark and brutal Metroidvania. Its visuals, inspired by the works of famous animator Ray Harryhausen, are harsh and dreary but absolutely gorgeous. Watching the game in motion is a visual treat. If you haven't checked out the trailer yet, you really should.

But you can also wait until next week and try the game out for yourself. A demo for The Spirit of the Samurai will launch on October 14, 2024, for the upcoming Steam Next Fest. I'm not sure what the demo covers, but it'll likely be an early section of the game. Hopefully, it includes some Chisai action. C'mon, you know what we want.


The Spirit of the Samurai launches on PC via Steam on December 12, 2024.

The recent release of Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will have had many Switch owners pondering the robustness of their control setup; as much as we like the console's Joy-Con and Pro Controller offerings, they're not exactly ideal for the intense nature of one-on-one fighting games.
That's where Hori's Fighting Commander for Nintendo Switch comes in. The latest in a long line of similar pads created by the Japanese company, this controller has been designed with competitive brawlers in mind.

I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

Those in the market for a fresh addition to their Game Boy Color library might want to check out Sofia the Witch: Curse of the Monster Moon — a brand-new puzzler from developer Jake Macher and published by Bitmap Soft.
This one looks really rather sweet. You play as Sofia, a witch (obviously) who sets out on a platforming mission to save her friends from the clutches of a lunar curse. Despite there only being four central worlds, there are six different endings to unlock and a host of hidden bosses, minigames and secret areas — a little something to take your time over, perhaps.

We were particularly enamoured by The Eternal Life of Goldman's stunning hand-drawn aesthetic when we first glimpsed it at this year's THQ Nordic Showcase, but today's behind-the-scenes deep dive has seriously blown our socks off.
On paper, this platforming adventure is as charming as they come. There's an adorable elderly protagonist, a mysterious backdrop packed with folklore and fairytale references, and what appears to be a sweet gameplay flow consisting of running, jumping and cane-whacking. But the visuals really are the scene-stealer here, and that's what the publisher's new video is all about.

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

Mario & Luigi: Brothership is right around the corner and we are excited. We've been lucky enough to go hands-on with the latest entry in the wacky RPG series and we came away with 15 minutes of crisp new gameplay footage for you to see the Bros. back in action.
The above clips are taken from an early section of the game, showcasing two different islands that Mario & Luigi set out to save in the hopes of reuniting the fractured nation of Concordia. You'll see a decent amount of overworld exploring, some of the turn-based battles with the iconic Bro-specific button inputs and a peppering of the dry humour that we so loved in the series' GBA and DS titles.

Kind Words 2 is full of touching and drifting remarks like this, written by other players and tossed into the winds for you to find. If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

Nintendo fans over in Japan are going absolutely bonkers over the newly-released Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo accessory, causing Nintendo to suspend sales on its official website.
As communicated on social media, the firm has temporarily hit snooze on sales after an alarming (heh!) surge from Nintendo fans across the region.

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <updated>2024-10-09T11:49:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few gaming headsets weave together top sound quality, sustained comfort, and clean mic input as deftly as the Logitech G Pro X Wireless. As such, it usually costs a bundle, but with Prime Big Deal Days administering some cuts, it’s going cheaper right now. A lot cheaper: on Amazon UK, it’s down to £110, a full 50% off the RRP. Amazon US, meanwhile, has it down from $230 to $130.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

The colourful game about a troubled arena fighter retiring into a life of lapsang souchong and repressed urges to do sudden violence had previously been planned for a release some time in 2024, according to the developer's original announcement. But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

And if space is the sole concern, it’s hard to get more substantial than the 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra. Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US. Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

Despite releasing this year, it’s designed to fit the last-gen AM4 motherboard socket – which sounds strange, because it is, but then the 5700X3D is also the cheapest Ryzen chip to feature AMD’s extremely game-friendly 3D V-Cache tech. The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK.

Which is a shame, as the OLED gaming monitors I’ve used have invariably looked sumptuous, without the movement blurring issues you might expect if you own a TV of the same panel tech. Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authorities in Italy say that a major IPTV piracy investigation has uncovered a "sophisticated fraud" involving channels and content owned by Sky, DAZN, Netflix and Mediaset. Coordinated by the public prosecutor in the southern city of Lecce, specialist financial and forensic officers were able to identify four people suspected of piracy and money laundering offenses. A court ordered the preventative seizure of five pieces of real estate and two vehicles.

The tileset is lovely, as are the little dialogue boxes and menus and the gentle bob of your backpack-ridden character as they walk. Basically, it looks like it's worth everyone's time, particularly because there's one big twist here - it's entirely free.

As there currently is, with Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days having returned to town. But don’t let my complete lack of original thinking overshadow two simple facts: one, this is still the best microSD card for the Steam Deck, and two, the 512GB model very nearly half price on both sides of the Atlantic. That’s £38 (down from £74) in the UK, and $40 (down from $76) in the US.

If Thaddius Cornflakes had recommended struggling families play Combo Critters instead of eating Cookie Crisp for dinner, I imagine the backlash would have been far more reserved. Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also free from Itch here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No game protagonist is more willing to stick his hand down a toilet than James Sunderland. Why is he doing this? You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo creators 343 Industries are having a bit of a glow-up. They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those dril tweets about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Silent Hill 2 remake is only out today, but it’s been nearly two years since the first system requirements appeared, immediately distressing our PCs so badly that they started having their own nightmares of fog-smothered towns and James Sunderland in an uncomfortably high-poly nurse outfit. Those requirements have since lowered and risen, and now we know for sure that nu-Silent Hill 2 is one tough customer for performance – albeit one that benefits greatly from just one or two key settings tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Now, it's time to start talking about brighter, metaversal tomorrows and hopefully, not do the whole thing all over again. Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, "interoperable" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not. Stealth blockchain post? Genuinely, I can neither confirm nor deny.

It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs. That contribution was insulted this week by a legal amendment that threatens ISPs with prison for failing to report piracy to the authorities. Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

I can handle the chill, but if the air's too still, things go downhill!
So, now that we're all sitting comfortably atop our heat pads: what are we all playing this weekend? Let's take a looksie at what we're all clicking on here in the treehouse.

Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest.

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I miss the height of Wordle mania not because of the game itself, which I still play on occasion, but because of the torrent of delightful, experimental browser-based puzzle games that followed in its wake. Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.

Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Football Manager series has been around for decades, each of its yearly entries gradually building upon its core systems until it became the mixture of deep simulation and banal press conference screens it is today. Football Manager 2025 is different: a fresh start for the series, built upon a new engine, which Sports Interactive are at pains to say will not immediately be as rich or robust as its predecessor.

It now has a release date: November 26th.

The platform's failure to cooperate with French authorities appears to have been a significant aggravating factor. The multi-billionaire was eventually released on bail, offering assurances that Telegram would change for the better. Interestingly, reports from France suggest that broadcasters of live sports are already seeing improvements on the piracy front.

Prior to this, all actions in games simply took place simultaenously, as fast as the player or players could make them. 

Fast forward to today and many games are now "turn-based", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a turn-based RPG fest featuring discounts and demos for "turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle".

Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom.

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite just releasing yesterday, Amazon and NCSOFT’s massively mate-filled RPG Throne And Liberty has already shot right up Steam’s most played charts. It's sitting just behind Black Myth: Wukong at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on Banana's level, mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look. Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more Kingdom Death Monster expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.
As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

The court's decision suggests that IP addresses may not be considered "links", potentially limiting the scope of these subpoenas. This interpretation could impact the music and film industries' efforts to identify and take action against infringers and operators of piracy services.

It's slated to launch in 2026. Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism.

It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into Tekken 8.

Developed by Yustas and published by Wall World and Beholder outfit Alawar, it casts you as an AI mayor, Iris, who is trying to create the perfect city in a world of social and economic calamity. A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the trailer for steampunk RPG New Arc Line released in April, I was immediately taken in by its premise. To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’m all for building dread through a lingering introduction, it’s always a treat to play a horror game that wastes no time tearing the moorings of familiarity right out from underneath you, as is the case with 13th Street Studios’ Becrowned. In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

The authorities are said to be preparing cases against customers, some of whom have already been arrested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[110 minut docela kvalitního retra, které připomíná spíše "Po strništi bos" než cokoliv od Bohdana Slámy, a pak 20 minut něčeho zcela jiného, co je buď vrcholně originální nebo vrcholně nevydařené, ale v každém případě to pramálo navazuje na 110 předchozích minut. Znovu se ukazuje, že Sláma bravurně zvládá drobné situace, ale má problémy s dvouhodinovým, někam směřujícím dějem. Krobot je jako obvykle úžasný. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
