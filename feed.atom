In what's becoming a bit of a familiar story for 2022, game sales for both PC and console are down in 2022 across Europe compared to 2021, Gamesindustry.biz reports. GSD data reveals that despite 159 million game sales across the markets, there's been an overall drop in sales of 7.1%.
However, the Nintendo Switch has still managed to get some good news out of this. It's overall the best-selling console in Europe, only missing out on the top spot in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway — though sales figures from the UK and Germany are not included, it's indeed the same story in the UK for the Switch. That's despite a drop in sales of 15% for the hybrid console. PS5 sales, however, slipped 35% across Europe, with only the Xbox Series X|S reporting growth of 4.4%.

A new study among thousands of researchers finds that the majority use pirate libraries to bypass paywalls. Lack of access is cited as the prime reason but, worryingly, many researchers also find shadow libraries easier to use than legal alternatives.

That’s looking less likely now that the US Federal Trade Commission have published a schedule that sets dates for final hearings to decide on the merger, and they're going to begin on August 2nd. As this is just the kick off for hearings about the case, it’s likely that any FTC decision on whether the $68.7 billion (£56 billion) deal can go ahead will take some time to emerge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humanity Ends Here
While the actual release is still two weeks out, publisher Electronic Arts is hoping to get the hype fires going with a new "launch trailer" for its highly anticipated remake, Dead Space. The iconic interstellar horror title makes its grand return January 27 on PC and ninth gen console platforms.
The dramatic, explosive trailer somewhat belies the sinister, slow creep and sense of pervading dread that punctuates Dead Space, making it appear something more of an action movie than a survival horror title. But, as fans will know, the 2008 original was one of the finest examples of the genre, and there's no telling how studio Motive has been able to bolster the excitement, adventure, and nerve-wracking tension of Visceral Games' seminal work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctQl9wa3ydE&t=78s&ab_channel=DeadSpace
Having been around the rumor mill more than enough times one would care to remember, the Dead Space remake was finally announced in the summer of 2021, with fans eagerly twiddling their thumbs for the past two years, eager to get their hands on the long-awaited title. The remake retains the narrative of the original game, as engineer Isaac Clarke investigates a distress signal sent by planetary mining vessel the USG Ishimura. Once aboard, Clarke discovers that matters have taken a turn far worse than anyone could have imagined, it what becomes a violent, terrifying fight for truth and survival.
Dead Space launches January 27 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

The upcoming Disney-themed free-to-play racer from Gameloft, Disney Speedstorm, came to a screeching halt in December of last year as it was suddenly announced that the game was (unsurprisingly) getting pushed back to 2023. This hasn't stopped the development team from sharing new details about the title however, and their latest reveal is all about the Crew System (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
Think of the Spirits model that was used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and you won't be a million miles away. Speedstorm's Crews will let you add extra abilities to your driver and kart by building a team of classic Disney characters before a race each with their own perks.The bonuses granted by this selection can change your kart's top speed, acceleration, handling and boosts amongst other stats, supposedly adding a tactical layer to each race.

We've seen Twitch chat beat games like Pokémon and even The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but how about a more active game? Over the holiday break, Twitch and variety streamer GappyV decided to invent the ultimate test - creating code that converted basic messages into Wii Remote and Nunchuk inputs to see if Twitch chat could "beat" all five games in Wii Sports.
While there were definitely some teething issues, once Twitch chat got the hang of each sport, it was mostly a success. Baseball ended up being the highlight. While it was quite a challenge for chat to get the hang of batting, in the end, it managed to get a home run. You can watch it all unfold in the video above.

Nintendo dropped an absolutely massive update for Splatoon 3 last November - bumping the game up to Version 2.0.0 and adding new features, improvements and adjustments. It followed with another minor update, so when is the next one?
In case you missed it in the 2.0.0 patch notes, there'll apparently be a balance update rolling out about halfway through Chill Season. Here's exactly what was mentioned at the time: "Our next update is planned for the middle of Chill Season 2022 and should focus on balance adjustments upon analysis of data from the newly added weapons.".

When I hear that a new game is coming based on a popular shonen anime or manga, I tend to assume that we're getting another fighting game that I'll forget about within a week. I can only assume that every Naruto fan is a pro-level arena fighting game player at this point, given the number of Ninja Storm games they've been faced with. One Piece: Burning Blood, Dragon Ball FighterZ, My Hero One's Justice, the ill-fated Jump Force — it seems to me that when you make a game based on a hit anime, the obvious move is to go for a fighting game.
Some of them are good, some of them are not, but boy... are there a lot of them.

A touchdown celebration animation is being removed from Electronic Arts' Madden NFL 23, in light of recent real-world events. The CPR celebration will be taken out of the game, after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field on January 2.
The celebration in question has the scoring player lie down the ground, while their teammates run over and give fake CPR to "revive" them. EA Sports told CBS Sports that celebration will be removed from the game relatively soon.
"EA Sports is taking steps to remove the celebration from Madden NFL 23 via an update in the coming days," a spokesperson told CBS.
Hamlin collapsed on the field during the Bills' game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2. He went into cardiac arrest, and personnel had to perform CPR on Hamlin.
Damar Hamlin has since been discharged from a hospital in Buffalo and will continue rehabilitation at home.

On the field, off the field
This isn't Madden NFL's first time seeing real-world events collide with in-game features. EA removed former Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden from Madden NFL 22 in 2021, following his resignation over remarks made in emails. Concussions and brain injuries have also been an ongoing topic for the Madden series, with some games working to address their portrayal of the issue.
And for sports on a grander scale, world politics come into play. Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from games like FIFA and NHL in response to the invasion of Ukraine, in line with its partners at FIFA, UEFA, and the IIHF.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ground theme.
"Touch grass" has become the rallying cry for angry people on the internet, and it's most often levelled at gamers. It's shorthand for "go outside", or simply "oh my god the thing you're complaining about is SO TERMINALLY ONLINE that you really should go and do something that isn't sitting at your computer yelling at strangers on the internet". It's sort of like saying "calm down", but much more evocative: We really all should go outside more, shouldn't we?
YouTuber and Twitch streamer j0rts, who appears to be some kind of duck, spends most of his videos doing strange and "mostly pointless things", as he himself puts it. This includes playing Mario Kart with only his eyes, beating Super Mario 64 at 400% speed, and trying to complete the Great Deku Tree dungeon without ever turning left.

As a result of the Poke_Times Twitter account 2023 celebration, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet now have a number of free item codes you can plug right into the game for bonus gifts. While this promotion ends in the middle of the month of January you do have some time to enter them; and the rewards aren't anything wild like a free unique Pokemon.

If you miss out, it's no big deal. These codes just provide you with a random item from the following table:
x1 Stardust (1,500 Pokedollar sell price)
x1 Star Piece (6,000 Pokedollar sell price)
x1 Comet Shard (12,500 Pokedollar sell price)
All of these items can be sold to vendors for free Pokedollars (cash). If you need help redeeming them, you can find a full mystery gift walkthrough here. The gist is that you'll need to fully complete the tutorial (to the point where the treasure hunt begins, after the academy portion) to redeem mystery gifts.
After that, you'll be able to acquire them at any time using online distribution methods, as well as codes (like the aforementioned item drops). Enjoy!

Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull and Bones has been delayed yet again, despite already having being delayed for the fifth time last September.

At least it's (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft's general underperforming sails. Sorry, sales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My two favorite things: gaming and sustainability
Microsoft has made it clear over the past few years that they're making an effort to help out the planet, and their newest movement toward their goal of being a "carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste" company takes the form of a brand new update that will impact how Xbox consoles consume power. The update will make Xbox consoles "carbon aware," similar to an update that affected Windows 11 that was released last year.
Upon a one-time download, the new Xbox update will automatically apply changes to the console's settings when it boots up. Major changes include consoles updating automatically to the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which means power consumption will be reduced while the console is turned off. This setting will cause the console to boot more slowly, but it will save 20x the amount of energy while active, Microsoft says. In addition, the Xbox will not wake at its usual nightly hours of 2-6am for maintenance, and will instead wake to perform updates at any time that uses the most renewable energy.

Of course, these settings are entirely optional, and players can turn them off any time they choose. The aforementioned updates will be automatically applied for Xbox Insiders as of today, but Microsoft did include instructions for non-Insiders to implement these changes on their own when they become available in the future. For a full breakdown of these instructions and details of the entire carbon aware update, check out this post on the official Xbox blog.

Square Enix has announced that it will be unveiling yet another mobile release set within the world of the iconic franchise Dragon Quest. The as-yet-unannounced title will be showcased in a special event held on Wednesday, January 18.
While no further details were revealed at this early stage, a new teaser website and Twitter channel have been launched in Japan. According to Gematsu, the new title will be an RPG, and next week's event will feature a gameplay overview along with a new trailer and further release details. The live stream will take place on the official Square Enix Japan YouTube channel, January 18, at 19:00 JST / 02:00 PT / 11:00 BST.

This release will be the latest in a long, long line of Dragon Quest titles released for mobile devices. These games have ranged from rereleases of Dragon Quest classics, to an abundance of free-to-play RPGs, monster trainers, and geolocation titles. Many of these modern releases have ended service within two-to-three years of launch. The most recent release in this medium, Dragon Quest Tact, launched in North America in January 2021 and remains currently operational.
We'll soon find out whether this new release is a full premium RPG or another flash-in-the-pan F2P title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The OG Zelda game like we've never seen it before
Of all the games to be modded into VR, the original Legend of Zelda game was near the bottom of my list in terms of expectations. Usually when a game goes VR, it's already got a 3D art style, but I have to admit adding a whole new dimension to a title, especially such a classic one, is a really intriguing idea. Now we get a chance to see what that experience is like, because Japanese modder and retro gaming enthusiast Sugar Noe posted a video of themselves playing The Legend of Zelda to both Twitter and YouTube, as originally reported by Nintendo Life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vNA8-UE780
In 2021, a user named DeTwelve created a mod called The Legend of Doom, which faithfully recreates The Legend of Zelda in the engine of the original Doom. Then Sugar Noe took that mod and made their own tweaks so that it would be playable on a Quest VR headset. This thing has layers, but the final result has to make for one of the most immersive Zelda experiences ever.
I played through The Legend of Zelda with a friend a few years ago on his SNES Classic, but admittedly I wasn't too intrigued considering how much the game showed its age, if you can pardon my blasphemy. We never finished it, but I will say that the added twist of playing it in VR might just be the push I need to get the very first Zelda game under my belt once and for all.

Okay, hands up — who watched the 1989 The Legend of Zelda cartoon growing up? It's certainly a product of its time, and is famous for everyone's favourite catchphrase from the hero of Hyrule himself, "Well, excuuuuse me, Princess!". Now Polygon has published interviews with many of the writers, voice actors, and creators of the show which reveal many behind-the-scenes secrets.
Published as part of Polygon's Zeldathon, the publication's year-long celebration of all things Zelda in anticipation of Tears of the Kingdom's release on 12th May, the article shares many of the show's creators' thoughts and reflections on the now-infamous cartoon. The 13-episode-long show aired during the Friday slot of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, but only lasted for one season.

Bandai Namco has released a new gameplay overview trailer for its upcoming RPG Tales of Symphonia Remastered, which will launch on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on February 17.
The epic anime adventure, a remix of the 2003 Nintendo GameCube classic, tells a typical tale of a mysterious "Chosen One" who is prophesized to one day rise up from the people and save the land from impending doom. And when that doom finally arrives in the form of parallel worlds Sylvarant and Tethe'alla, young hero Lloyd Irving realizes that doing the right thing doesn't always work both ways...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2mYyeIPbo&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
The new remaster features a variety of aesthetic and technical overhauls, including enhanced graphics, a modernized control system, retweaked balance, and a variety of additional features to further polish the beloved GameCube adventure. Tales of Symphonia Remastered supports up to four players in co-op action, as you and your energetic party travel the lands, battle beasties, and attempt to alter the fate of not one, but two worlds and the people that reside within them.
If you're too young for the original title, or you simply never got around to checking it out, then this new remaster will offer a fresh opportunity. Held in very high regard by both critics and players of its time, this anime escaped will be worth a peek for anybody with a fondness for the classic approach to adventure gaming.
Tales of Symphonia Remastered launches February 17 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

At the end of 2022, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy PIxel Remaster, a collection composed of revamped versions of Final Fantasy I through VI, would finally be making its way to Nintendo Switch, putting to rest many months of speculation from eager fans. It’s big news, as its release means that FF-loving Switch owners will soon be able to enjoy every mainline Final Fantasy game from the very beginning of the series all the way to the 12th entry, minus MMOPRG Final Fantasy XI.
Aside from the mainline series, Switch owners can also currently access a number of spin-offs, including the likes of the recently released Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, World of Final Fantasy MAXIMA, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, and Chocobo GP. Needless to say, there’s plenty of choice on the Switch if you’re a fan of Square Enix’s flagship franchise, and the introduction of the Pixel Remaster compilation in 2023 begs the question: What’s next for Final Fantasy on the Switch?

Ubisoft is making more big shifts to its future plans. The company announced today that it is cancelling three more unannounced games, pushing Skull and Bones further back, and is planning a cost reduction of more than €200 million over the next two years.
The shift to Ubisoft's future plans was announced today, and the publisher attributes the shift to several factors. Two of Ubisoft's 2022 titles, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023, underperformed. And Ubisoft also cites worsening macroeconomic conditions as a factor in its new plans.

This batch of toys is coming from Jakks Pacific, which already has a pretty extensive range of affordable Mario Bros. toys. So a Mario Movie set isn't too surprising! (Thanks for the tip, Davis!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has canceled three unannounced games, the company has revealed in its latest financial update. It has also delayed Skull and Bones, which has already been delayed several times in the past. 
The company cites "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles that can reach players across the globe, across platforms and business models." It says that over the last four years, its strategy has been about building "long-lasting live games and adapting our strongest franchises" like Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, and The Division "to converging trends to make them truly global brands."

Peanut butter and jelly. Batman and Robin. Video games and bugs. There are just some things that go together. It doesn't matter how good or how polished a video game is — these days, it's nearly impossible to get through one without encountering a bug in one way or another, even if we don't realize it. Even in games that get a ton of continued support after launch, like Stardew Valley, which also happens to be one of my most played and loved games of all time, it's inevitable to encounter a glitch every now and again.
Squashing bugs in game development often becomes a race against a deadline as more and more issues pop up, and it seems increasingly common these days that games are shipping with glaring issues because they can simply be fixed with…]]></summary>

Tribute Games' radical throwback brawler TMNT: Shredder's Revenge has made a surprise arrival on mobile platforms — But while the Heroes in a Half-Shell are now readily available to download on Android and iOS platforms, the game itself is only accessible to Netflix subscribers.
It would appear that the 2022 scrapper, a love letter to the TMNT arcade titles of yore, is the newest release in the burgeoning Netflix Games division, and as such requires a Netflix sub to play the title at all. One would assume that this also applies to online modes of Shredder's Revenge, so hopefully you have three pals all subbed to the streaming service if you want some handheld multiplayer action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qcaEQVBcY0&ab_channel=Netflix
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge sees the fab four team with Channel 9 reporter April O'Neil, sensei Master Splinter, and sporting goods vigilante Casey Jones on a mission to stop The Shredder and his Foot Clan from taking over The Big Apple. The game features a huge variety of cameos and references to Eastman and Laird's iconic 1987 TV series — including appearances from Bebop & Rocksteady, The Rat King, Irma, Vernon, and the Teenagers from Dimension X.
The mobile port is not currently in parity with the PC and console releases, sitting just one update behind. So while not all of the game's bugs and issues have been ironed out for the mobile port, the majority of features and modes are all present and ready to rock. For our thoughts on the original release, check out our full review right here.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

Bayonetta 3 came and conquered, but Platinum Games has been infrequently tweaking the game since its October 2022 release. Beyond the initial day one launch patch, this week is the only time it's been adjusted in a major way: in this instance, via version 1.2.0, which was implemented late on January 10, 2023.
So there's a few things this patch addresses:
Combat adjustments that mainly apply to Viola
Nerfs to many Niflheim challenge stages (which a lot of people asked for, even on higher-end difficulties)
The Tricolored Keys/Old Picture Book secret is easier to access, as you just get the Tricolored Keys automatically now

The Switch is home to enough turn-based tactics games to last a lifetime, but that hasn't deterred Mipumi, the studio behind the point and click adventure The Lion's Song, from working on a title which looks to stand out from the rest.
Howl is set to land on Switch later this year (we can't be more specific than 'early 2023' at the moment), but this tactical wolf hunter has managed to attract our interest. Based on the newly-released gameplay video (above) the title has all of the howlmarks (sorry) of your classic turn-based adventure - predict your enemy's moves, shift your character, plan you attack - but where Howl stands out is in its 'living ink' visuals which make each movement look like a watercolour painting come to life.

Yes, its side-scrolling action is so buttery smooth it should come with a cholesterol warning. Its soundtrack is sublime. It looks gorgeous. But for me, the chewiest bit is the story.

Several months ago we learned that Return to Dream Land is coming to the Switch in 2023 as Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and we haven't heard much about it since. That changes today, as we have new copy ability reveals: the best kind of Kirby reveals.
The announcement come by way of two tweets, both of which are from the Nintendo UK account. The first one confirms "Sand," a new copy ability coming to Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, which allows Kirby to "shift sand into a variety of shapes, from a fist to a castle, and take on even the toughest foes." So like the Spider-Man villain Sandman? That sounds rad. The other is actually a returning copy ability that hails from Kirby Star Allies. It's none other than "Festival," which is a dancing-based ability that's kind of like an ultimate (think screen-freezing mass damage).

I'm ready to return to Dream Land
It's crazy to think that 11 years later this game is making a grand return, but I couldn't be happier. Return to Dream Land Deluxe deserves a bigger spotlight, and it'll get it on the Switch: which has its massive (and growing) install base. Also, to be frank, it'll be easier to replay it on the Switch (though I still have my Wii U [which I use!] hooked up out of respect [and to play old Wii games!]).

The retro-inspired market went from novel to heavily saturated rather quickly, and now they’ve been their own corner of the industry for over a decade. It’s a rather difficult corner to stand out in. It’s a pretty busy corner.
For my money, it’s a precarious balancing act between building off designs and mechanics of the era, while also finding a memorable identity. You can make Contra again, and if you do a good job, that can be good enough. But you can’t stand with the big boys unless you bring your own pants. Or something. I sometimes just hork up analogies and hope they make sense.
With Oniken, Odallus, and Blazing Chrome under their belt, JoyMasher has tried on a few pairs of pants in their years. Really, though, those games harken rather heavily toward their influences.  …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stepping back in time.
Making any video game is exceptionally hard work. But creating a retro-style experience that feels 100% authentic to the source inspiration adds a whole extra layer of difficulty. Implementing pixel art visuals and calling it a day just doesn't cut it, but what developer JoyMasher has done with Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is truly remarkable. Much like its previous effort with Blazing Chrome, the team has successfully created a 2D action title that looks, sounds, and plays like it came straight from the early ‘90s, down to the exceptional environmental detail and enemy design.
Inspired by the likes of Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master and Strider, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is a sci-fi action platformer in which you take on the role of the titular Moonrider, a cybernetic ninja who rejects its intended purpose as a tool to preserve a totalitarian state and instead wages war against its creators. After making your way through the opening level (we recommend playing through the excellent tutorial section, too), you’ll have a choice of six additional stages to tackle in whichever order you see fit, followed by two final stages to round out the experience. Each stage houses its own boss character and beating each of these will grant you a new ability. Very similar to Mega Man in many ways, then.

Famitsu has released its annual sales charts for 2022, and Pokémon Scarlet & Violet — unsurprisingly — has topped the year's sales, selling an incredible 4,338,931 units since its release in November (thanks, Nintendo Everything!).
If you've been following the headlines and the weekly Japanese charts, then this won't come as a surprise to you. Pokémon always does well — in 2021, Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl was the second best-selling game of the year, for example. Scarlet & Violet sold over 2.5 million copies in its first week, and the momentum hasn't really stopped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's dangerous to go 'lone.
Though it flew under a lot of radars, Cuddle Monster Games’ Hell is Other Demons was a standout platform shooter of 2019, featuring razor-sharp, ultra-tough action gameplay alongside a delicious neon aesthetic. Considering it was mostly the work of just one man by the name of Hannes Rahm, Hell is Other Demons was an impressive achievement and a great example of a niche classic. Rahm's latest project is Lone Ruin, which feels in a lot of ways like a spiritual successor to that initial release. That same dark atmosphere and intense gameplay are present, but now things play out in 3D. Though Lone Ruin doesn’t feel like it quite meets the bar its predecessor set, it still manages to be a raucously good time while it lasts.
Lone Ruin is all about the gameplay, which is equal parts thrilling and simple. A typical run involves you entering a room, clearing out all waves of enemies, collecting the reward (if you survive), then moving on to the next room. Most enemies go down after just a few shots, but the tricky part comes in with how easily you can get swarmed by them. Some enemies can shoot lasers and projectiles while others may explode on contact, and when things really heat up, there’s scarcely a square inch of space to be found onscreen where your character won’t be hurt. Luckily, your character is pretty light on their feet, and they also have a dash move on a small cooldown that can grant a few i-frames of respite while you reposition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, "I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that," according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, "There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5." 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a "PS5 exclusive for six months." Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this "Ambition" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['I guess we really are The Last of Us Part I'
Following a frankly obnoxious amount of media build-up and endless think-pieces, HBO finally previewed its live-action adaptation of The Last of Us to an army of critics, who have been overwhelmingly positive in their response to the grim-looking televisual take of the hit game series.
The new series currently sits at an incredible 97% on the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, with a score calculated from a total of 60 media reviews. The long-in-development series, which will debut on the HBO network next week, sees beleaguered protagonists Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) pick their way through a dilapidated shell of the United States, attempting to stay one step ahead of thieving marauders and the terrifying mutated humans known as "Clickers."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM&ab_channel=HBOMax
The HBO TV adaptation was first announced back in 2020, a seemingly snug fit for a game series so beholden to its distinct cinematic style. The show is produced by a litany of companies including Sony Pictures, Word Games, Naughty Dog, and the recently founded PlayStation Productions. The show itself is written by Craig Mazin, the Emmy award-winning creator of equally grim series Chernobyl, and Neil Druckmann, the writer of the video game iterations of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.
If you're looking forward to the new show, then you won't have too much longer to wait. The first episode will air this Sunday, January 15, on HBO and HBO Max. In the UK, The Last of Us will air at 02:00 BST on Monday mornings via Sky Atlantic and NOW TV, to coincide with the U.S. timeslot. Don't fret staying up, as each episode will be made available on demand after its respective premiere.
We're about to hit a whole new wave of Last of Us discourse, folks. Batten down the fuckin' hatches.

After all, you might be able to scare off a predator, but there’s no negotiating with an ocean current.
Aquatico promises city-building enthusiasts a deep dive into this nearly untapped environ (nearly untapped, I’ll get into that later) but while this game delivers on the ocean’s beauty, it’s disappointingly light on peril.

We are just over a month away from the release of Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and the team over at HAL Laboratory has started drip-feeding us new additions to the game. The most prominent of these is the reveal of Kirby's new Copy Abilities - power-ups gained after inhaling an enemy. We already knew of the Mecha ability from the first trailer, but it looks like a whole lot more is on the way.
Shared via @NintendoUK, the game will introduce a new 'Sand' Copy Ability for the pink puffball. This power-up will allow Kirby the chance to manipulate the environment into protective shelter, or blast enemies with granular attacks. Slashing at your opponents with a sword or scorching them with fire is one thing, but putting some sand in their eye? That's truly evil.

The satisfaction that comes from doing well in a deckbuilding game is like nothing else. Whether you're playing a physical game like the excellent (if dryly titled) DC Deck-Building Game or a video game like the infinite time-suck that is Slay the Spire, it just feels good to build and unleash your own slate of moves. But recently, I've found myself bored by straight up-and-down deckbuilders. A lot of them feel very similar, and while there are plenty of good games playing with the same ideas, I've started actively seeking out deckbuilders with slightly bigger ideas.

Within my all-encompassing obsession with farming/community simulators, there is yet another obsession, like the layers to an onion: I cannot stop playing the fishing mini-games. My current Stardew Valley save is set on the fishing-friendly river farm, most of my Dreamlight Valley villagers give me a fishing bonus, and the aquarium was the first part of the museum that I completed in Animal Crossing: New Horizons by a country mile. In spite of my fascination with these mini games, I have next to no real-life interest in fish at all. Well, that's not quite right. I like fish, in that I enjoy the ocean and aquariums and the like, but once they leave the water it's game over.

"Nobody said a word about a PC version release," said Yoshi P, the producer on both FFXIV and FFXVI. "Why is it like a PC version is releasing 6 months later? Don't worry about that, buy a PS5!" he said, laughing.

We've been working under the assumption that Final Fantasy 16 would come to PC after a period of PlayStation 5 exclusivity, but in fairness, that's because that's what the Final Fantasy 16 trailers have said would happen.

The newest patch for Marvel Snap is live, adding some new locations and balancing several cards. Galactus, Leader, and a few other are among the primary fixes in this latest update, as the Marvel Snap team is keeping an eye on their power level.
In the latest update notes, Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner outlines how the patch affects some of the common deck archetypes. Cards like Galactus, Leader, and Aero are cards worthy of building a deck around, and they've seen some bumps in popularity.
Galactus specifically moves from a 6/3 to a 6/2, slightly adjusting his power. The balance team says that even at the highest ranks of play, Galactus is seeing "concerningly high" win rates, and they'll be keeping an eye on the world-eater as time goes on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Never doubt the power of the Steam Sale
Valve has announced that its popular PC retail platform, Steam, smashed a major record this past weekend, surpassing 10 million concurrent in-game players for the first time in the platform's near 20-year history.
The mighty number was achieved on Saturday, January 7, with a peak high of 10,082,055 Steam users in-game. That's not sitting idle, or just logged in, but actively playing in one of the hundreds of thousands of titles in the Steam library. On Sunday, January 8, this figure was further surpassed, with a peak player count of 10,284,568. In addition to breaking the active player record, Steam also beat out its current record for overall concurrent users, with a weekend high of 33,078,963.
That's a lot of people grinding for trading cards.
Steam typically hits high figures during the winter period, mostly due to the advent of its annual, wallet-munching Steam sale. This period is then followed by a plethora of users playing their new games, spending holiday gift vouchers, or simply chilling during their time away from work, school, or college. This latest winter, in addition, will have seen many in possession of a shiny new Steam Deck remaining logged in and/or playing while on the go, which no doubt also helped pushed these numbers into new frontiers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take the horror home with you
Signalis was one of the best games of 2022, and it's certainly one of the best horror titles that's come out in the past few years. While the title was sadly left out of the conversation for a lot of awards at the end of last year, it's grown a steady cult following with fans — I can see it being one of those games that's only appreciated more and more as time goes on. We're off to a good start though, because pre-orders are now up for physical editions of Signalis for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
The physical edition will run players $29.99 (Signalis pre-orders are currently listed online at Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target in the US), but Humble Games is sweetening the deal by adding in an extra bonus item for players to enjoy: a holographic replica polaroid, which is a key item in the actual game. I'd love to see Signalis get some fancy special edition releases in the future (maybe for an anniversary down the line or something), but for now this physical edition should make for a great collector's piece.
https://twitter.com/LastStarfarer/status/1611439084328583168
Here at Destructoid we're huge fans of Signalis — Eric Van Allen gave it a 9.5/10 score in his review, and I even chronicled my own experience playing the game, and how it's helped me confront my fear of horror games. If you've been on the fence about giving this title a try, now's the perfect opportunity to get in there and check it out.

There's an art to a good video game demo. How do you make a slice of a game available to prospective buyers that's both representative of the final product and small enough that they still want to buy it? A video game is interactive, so a perfect "trailer" for a game should also be interactive, but how do you ensure that you're not showing your whole hand? A movie trailer can include a curated slice of narrative, but a demo must include a curated slice of gameplay, just enough to hook the player without handing them a full game. It's a delicate balancing act.
These days, it feels like the "demo" is in an interesting place. Very few AAA titles put in the work to offer up an interesting demo of any kind. In the rare instances that they're available, the playable advertiseme…]]></summary>

Aang and the gang are getting a new video game adaptation, heading straight to phones. Avatar Generations is a new free-to-play mobile RPG set to arrive in early 2023 for Android and iPhone, with pre-registration open now.
Based on the Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender, Generations retells the journey of Aang and friends across the Four Nations. Battles take place in turn-based squad formation, letting players build their own team to tackle enemies.
Plenty of beloved characters look set to return, too. The obvious suspects, like Aang, Zuko, Toph, Katara, and Sokka, are all here. But so are Suki, Gyatso, Princess Yue, and others from through The Last Airbender. A new gameplay trailer released today shows them all in action:

Bitmap Books, publisher of the fantastic "Visual Compendium" range, has regretfully canceled its long-delayed volume Sega Mega Drive: A Visual Compendium, following legal fallout from Sega itself.
The new tome would have been the eighth release in the popular Bitmap Books series, following on from editions on platforms such as the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, NES, and SNES. The sleek, hefty books feature a plethora of visual material from each platform's archives, ranging from sprites and stages to boxart and marketing materials. Sega had originally backed Bitmap Books for a Sega Master System edition, but seemingly would not close the same deal for its 16-bit counterpart.

Meta has announced that it is winding down support for the first iteration of its Quest VR technology. In an email obtained by UploadVR, Meta explained how the changes will affect Quest 1 users from spring forward.
Quest 1 user will still be able to use all of the currently available apps and hardware, but no new features will be included in Quest 1 updates and the compatibility of apps moving forward is not guaranteed. Additionally, as of March, Quest 1 users will no longer be able to create or join parties, and will lose all access to the Meta Horizon Home features. So no more visiting your virtual pals or inviting them over to your virtual abode.
Meta notes that it will continue to roll out critical bug fixes and security patches until 2024.
Released in 2019 as the successor to Oculus GO, Quest launched in the spring of 2019 at a retail price of $400. It would be superseded in fall 2020 by Quest 2. A side iteration, Quest Pro, was launched at the end of last year, with Meta tentatively suggesting that its next technology, Quest 3, will arrive at some point later this year.
Sony's own virtual reality technology, PSVR2, is set to launch worldwide on PS5 February 23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Face your Fears
We are just two weeks out from the launch of Square Enix' fantasy adventure Forspoken, and the publisher is ramping up its marketing drive with an evocative new cinematic trailer, spotlighting our hero, Frey, and the challenges that she faces in both this world and the next.
In the short cinematic, we see Frey on the run in two distinctly different scenarios, one in the avenues and alleyways of New York City, and then in the jungles and desert plains of the mysterious nation of Athia. Regardless of the terrain, the threat, and the motivation, Frey's goal remains the same: Survival. And, ultimately, when her back is against the wall, she will have no option but face her pursuers, and turn the hunters into the hunted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6goMdDb4UQ&ab_channel=SquareEnix
Forspoken is an open-world fantasy adventure developed by Luminous Productions. While its protagonist is intriguing, its world lush and vibrant, and its visual effects sharp and dazzling, the incoming release is struggling to light the hype fires as its publisher might have hoped. It has, admittedly, become incredibly trendy to rag on this game, but I'm personally willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt, for now.
Still, optimism will only carry a title so far, and the truth will out soon enough when Forspoken finally makes it into the hands of the players.
Forspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC. Check out Chris Carter's thoughts on the demo here.

Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2.

This new studio is called Maverick Games and the team there is already working on a new "premium open-world game for consoles and PC," according to a Eurogamer report. This studio is not connected to Microsoft's Xbox umbrella of studios. 
Forza Horizon 5's creative director, Mike Brown, is leading Maverick and is joined by Playground's former lead producer Tom Butcher, who is the new studio's executive producer, former technical director Matt Craven, who is Maverick's chief technical officer, and former technical art director Gareth Harwood, who is now content director.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry," he tells me. "We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention."

That suit alleged that CDPR had "made materially false or misleading statements" regarding the game, particularly as related to the condition of its console release, and sought damages.

The Sniper plays banjo, and the Pyro's contributions are soul warming. Enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try not to bang on about it, but in the interests of transparency, it's important to stress how much I loathe most soulslikes. Even the name, to be frank. So when I say that I don't love Asterigos Colon Curse of the Stars, it's not as damning as it may sound.
You're Hilda, a stabby lass who, for reasons, must investigate and lift a curse from a big ol' fantasy city. By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed. I respect that it picks and chooses soulsy elements instead of tracing over the whole design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I knew Minecraft had an ending, but I didn't know that ending consists of an unskippable 9 minute long poem. I also didn't know that last month the author of that poem, Julian Gough, placed it into the public domain, which according to him he's legally entitled to do because nobody at Mojang or Microsoft ever successfully got him to sign a contract.
He now says Microsoft are stonewalling any attempts to contact them about whether or not they own the copyright, and that this silence killed a piece he'd written for an unnamed "global news organisation" because they didn't want to risk drawing the ire of Microsoft's 1700 strong lawer team. That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a "blockage of the flow of love". It's a trip.

Described as a spiritual sibling to their most recent OPUS game, the brilliant Echo Of Starsong, the exact magic combo of words that made my eyes go all wide and saucer-like was "a cross between What Remains Of Edith Finch and Makoto Shinkai films", which just - you know what, I'm going to shut up now so you can watch the teaser trailer.

If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo mode that allows players to create their own custom maps and modes. In the past, players used Forge to remake classic maps or remix existing ones. But Infinite’s take on Forge is more robust, allowing forgers to create maps that don’t look like they belong in Halo. No, seriously, what is Whiterun doing in Infinite?

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: "We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger." 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is "more story to tell" in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't "have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show." 
"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid," he continued. "Endings mean everything to me." 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us is not the first adaptation from video game to film and it certainly won’t be the last. But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…]]></summary>

It's the latter that is currently being given away for free over on the Epic Games Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What do you get when you blend Mega Man X, Ninja Gaiden, and Bionic Commando? You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. 
Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel.

In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

Granted, my gaming tastes wax and wane over a year, with lengthy JRPG stints rolling inevitably into junk food like Assassin's Creed Valhalla. No matter what, my one constant is an FPS or 'competitive' game, I suppose. Games like Apex, or Warzone, or even Fortnite.
And yet, for whatever reason, I don't consider them as candidates for the Bestest Best games of any year. I might pour hundreds, possibly thousands of hours into them and they won't even make it into my personal list of absolute faves. That's reserved for games, not games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed that it has sold more than 30 million PlayStation 5 units since the console's launch in 2020. 
This news comes by way of the company's recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you're still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

The company revealed this during its CES 2023 presentation yesterday, stating that the kit is "designed to remove barriers to gaming and help players with disabilities play more easily, more comfortably, and for longer periods on PS5." It seems to be PlayStation's answer to Xbox's Adaptive Controller also aimed at accessibility for gamers. The company says it has worked with accessibility experts at organizations like AbleGamers, Special Effect, and Stack Up, as well as community members and game developers to design a controller kit like this that works "out of the box."

Your options are to binge the game in two weeks, buy the game outright, or cry. Unless you were playing Mortal Shell, in which case all you have to do is wait a month for the title to be re-added. The fantasy Soulslike had left the service on November 30th last year, but now it's back, this time with the Enhanced Edition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.]]></summary>

Even Vampire Survivors wigged me out because it's so visually busy by the end game, and I was in a more "Ferrero Rocher and jigsaw of the London Underground map" sort of place. My downfall was seeing PowerWash Simulator on sale on Steam. I bought it, and then played it for 40 hours.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/04/dds-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-five-unannounced-games"/>
        <updated>2023-01-04T13:49:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting "fewer than 15 people," according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also "built at least six of its own game studios," according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename "Jabberwocky," according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains "committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world," adding that it has "made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways."

Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft's umbrella of teams to unionize and it's also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitman 3 will be renamed Hitman World Of Assassination, and Hitman 1 and 2 will be delisted from sale. These changes are Io Interactive's solution to the currently messy process of buying Hitman games or working out what you already own. From January 26th, when these changes take effect, there will be just two Hitman packages for sale. This might mean that you're getting some existing content for free, and it will mean that future DLC purchases should cost less.

With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won't be too far behind.

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

        <updated>2023-01-03T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will "massively boost performance." You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. "DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals," Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. "A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty."
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that "early 2023" ends up being as soon as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a "major content update" sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!
pic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0
December 30, 2022
The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's "just one small tidbit" of what's still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than "2023," so it could come out any time this year.

Per VGC, this info comes from a Bethesda support site that went live earlier this month. There are three other questions/answers about the game on the site, but no new info - which isn't weird considering, y’know, the game’s not actually out yet - aside from the message “Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X|S and PC in the first half of 2023.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
"Hitman 3 will become 'Hitman World of Assassination,' which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms."
"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing." 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023," IO writes in a blog post. "The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment." 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

More recently, Squeenix partnered with the “environmentally friendly” blockchain firm Oasys, probably to sidestep potential controversies about, y'know, the environmental impact of the technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a "fully-fledged social heist universe" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the "official reveal trailer" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 "the year of PayDay 3." Here's hoping that holds true.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this "first half of 2023" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023," the support page reads.
This isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...]]></summary>

A Texas federal court says it will dismiss the company's lawsuit against an alleged BitTorrent pirate if its corporate suspension isn't fixed by January 21.

That includes a renewed hope that I’ll hear more information about a few exciting games that had little to no presence in 2022. Hopefully, with 365 chances to make a splash, one of the following titles from my personal wish list will make a big comeback after spending a year in relative silence. 
  



      
												
DokeV
DokeV feels like the “everything” video game, and it almost looks too good to be true. This delightfully colorful title is, among other things, part MMO, part open-world sandbox, part Pokemon, part Ghostbusters, and part llama-riding simulator. Name something that’s fun, and DokeV probably has it. The project has been in the works for at least a couple of years by Pearl Abyss, best known for its popular MMO, Black Desert Online…]]></summary>

It’s hard to say anything about GTA III that hasn’t been said a million times over the last 20 years, but suffice it to say, it laid a blueprint for open-world games so complete that the game industry still largely follows it today.
To celebrate the game’s 20th anniversary, we recently talked to Rockstar North art director Aaron Garbut over email about his time working on GTA III, what it meant for Rockstar as a company, and its overall legacy in 2021. Read more...]]></summary>

Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. 
The first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light. Deep Silver then handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the year’s biggest open-world games, Elden Ring and Pokémon Scarlet have been Frankensteined into one tantalizing entity thanks to the work of one talented modder.
The modder in question goes by the handle Arestame, who tweeted a trailer of their handiwork that drops Scarlet assets into the Lands Between. The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

It’s unclear if this mod will be publicly available to download or if this video is only a proof-of-concept showcase. We’ve reached out to Arestame for clarification and will update this story if we receive a response.

You might already be familiar with one, and that's Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-inspired character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn't go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
