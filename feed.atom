        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, it's been over 10 years since Volgarr the Viking delivered its brutal brand of hack-and-slash platforming. Now it's back for another round of glorious battle in Volgarr the Viking II, which is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and GOG on August 6, 2024.


You can see some of what developer Crazy Viking Studios has learned since releasing its debut game back in 2013 in the announcement trailer below.




It's wild to think about how many similarly challenging indie games have been thrust into players' hands since the original Volgarr launched. The space is more crowded than ever before, and it's also full of a ton of quality efforts within the same genre. As such, Crazy Viking Studios has evolved in some ways and is looking to offer players the means to hone their skills before putting them to the ultimate test on the battlefield.


Among those modern upgrades are features like practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and even the option to run through with unlimited continues. These additions may not wholly sate Volgarr's bloodlust, though, so you'll eventually want to try a run without them to see everything the sequel has to offer. As the description states, foregoing these "modern comforts" will allow you to unlock everything Volgarr the Viking II has to offer. 


Volgarr the Viking II was initially unveiled as part of this week's Guerrilla Collective showcase. It's nice to see the release date land in that August sweet spot, giving us plenty of time to sharpen our steel again with the first game before diving into the second.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

While some can be discovered through general exploration, others must be obtained during specific missions. In this guide, we'll focus on how to get the Facet of Sacrifice in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.


Where to find Facet of Sacrifice in Destiny 2: The Final Shape 


Destiny 2: The Final Shape's Facet of Sacrifice can be found in the Iconoclasm main campaign mission. It'll appear sometime after the defeat of the Dolgith, Blade of Reasoning. If you've already completed this quest, you can replay it on either Normal or Legendary mode via The Pale Heart map.


As you tread the pathway to the mission's waypoint, a broken statue will come into view. This is your cue to turn left and venture into a room where the Facet of Sacrifice lies.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Players must reach the upper level where a light shines. To do so, hop on the doorframe on the left and then jump to the elevated area.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Keep going through the openings of the pathway, resulting in the Facet of Sacrifice location. The Prismatic Fragment grants you a bonus Darkness Transcendence with an activated Arc, Solar, or Void buff. You can equip it via the Prismatic subclass section under Fragments.


More Prismatic Fragments can be found in other Destiny 2: The Final Shape main campaign missions. For example, Dissent and Ascent include these shiny new abilities on their respective pathways. Explore the rest of The Pale Heart map to collect them all, essentially becoming a Prismatic master.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the impending release of Euro 2024 tournament mode in FC Mobile, EA Sports has ensured that mobile games will be well-supported.


EA FC 24 players can already dive into an exclusive tournament mode packed with plenty of content on their PC, Nintendo Switch, and consoles. Mobile players will need to wait as of writing, but that won't be for long. In an official blog post, EA Sports has announced that Euro 2024 tournament mode will also be released for mobile devices, albeit with some changes.


FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode release date


First comes the release date, as the community will be anxious to try this new mode. In many ways, the upcoming tournament will resemble the FIFA World Cup mode, released in 2022. The Euro 2024 tournament is coming to mobile devices on June 11, 2024.




How to play FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode


The upcoming mode will feature all 24 qualified nations with authentic kits (Switzerland and Austria being the exceptions) and squads. Matches can be played at six different difficulties (you'll have to select at first). You will also be able to edit the selected lineup, and change tactics as required to get more wins. 


The group stages are based on real-life fixtures, but knockouts depend on your in-game progression. Once you win the tournament, you can share it with the rest of the world on social media. EA Sports will also introduce two new stadiums inspired by real-life locations:



Olympiastadion Berlin


BVB Stadion Dortmund



You'll also earn different rewards after completing the tournament, but EA Sports has yet to share all the details. More information is expected to arrive in Ultimate Team once the release date comes closer. With so many additional promo items coming soon, playing the FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode should be on the priority list for many players

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the UFL open beta up and running, you can try it out for free on your current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles.


Squad building is very different in this game from the underlying systems in other titles like EA FC 24 and eFootball 24. While you can buy a footballer directly from the market using in-game resources, there are packs to be opened for skins. But skins aren't the only way to improve players, as there's a smooth system to train them.


How to train cards in UFL open beta


All cards begin at level 0, but they can improve a lot once you train them. While the process takes time, the cards will soon become better versions of themselves.


Image via StrikerZ



Play as many matches as possible. Every time a game is over, all cards participating in it will gain experience points. The number of points earned will vary, and certain epic and legendary skins will help any card get more from a concluded match.


Select a card that has enough experience points to be leveled up. Select the level-up option, and a host of available choices will appear.


When you level up a card, you either increase a particular attribute or boost it (like an additional position).


Every level-up will cost 1 point; more can be earned by using the card in more matches.



Do note that cards with higher overall ratings will take longer to get sufficient level-up points (considering all other factors are the same). Also, make sure to buy players from the market based on the skins you have (this will make squad-building a lot easier).


UFL open beta will be available worldwide until June 9, and it's very easy to build up a mighty squad. While getting new cards is always an attraction, make sure to keep upgrading your existing ones to win more games.

For two days, Strikerz developers have opened their ongoing project to the general public.

While things definitely appear positive on certain fronts, matchmaking issues have been plaguing many gamers.

Matchmaking during the open beta has been far from smooth, which has been a cause of irritation for some.

This wave-based arcade-style shooter has a potent "one more run" hook as you try to ascend five levels while climbing the leaderboards, and we're intrigued to see more of it.

The MMO's expansion and patch schedule maintains a rather predictable beat, but we've seen a few curveballs along the way. 


With that in mind, here’s a timeline of previous FFXIV expansions in order by release date, along with the official release date for Version 7.0, Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail on July 2, and its early access details. 


A Realm Reborn

When the original Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 launched on September 30, 2010, it was immediately dubbed a failure. At least, that was until Yoshi P and his team stepped up to drag the game back from the dead, making it the incredibly successful MMO that we know today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're new to Warzone or first-person shooter games in general, there can be a lot of phrases and acronyms that won't make sense to you at first. One of those is TTK, but don't worry if you're lost, as I'm here to give you the answer. 


FPS games have dominated the gaming world for years, and Call of Duty is without question one of, if not the biggest of them all. It's no surprise then that it has a huge community of players, and has essentially created its own language among those who regularly play it. 


If you're new to the scene and see people talking about TTK, but just can't figure out what it means, then I've got you covered. 


TTK is super important. Image via Activision


What does TTK stand?


TTK in Warzone and other FPS games simply stands for "Time To Kill."


TTK in Warzone explained


Knowing what it stands for is all well and good, but what does it actually mean? Well, Time To Kill is exactly what it sounds like—how long it takes to kill an enemy from the moment you fire your weapon. Therefore, you want to use guns that have a low TTK as they'll be the quickest at eliminating your opponents. 


Now, it's worth remembering that having the fastest fire rate doesn't automatically mean it has a low TTK. You could use a gun with a high fire rate that deals very little damage, and its TTK would actually be slower than a gun with a low fire rate but high damage. Both fire rate and damage factor are included in the calculation. 


What gun has the fastest TTK in Warzone right now?


The Warzone gun with the fastest TTK right now is the SOA Subverter at 688 milliseconds. This battle rifle does pack quite the punch, but if you can control the recoil, you'll kill your enemies very quickly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion will take you quite some time to work through. Given the price of the expansion, this makes sense since you're paying the premium of a lot of bigger games. However, this also might leave you wondering just how far you have left until the main campaign is complete. Here are all the missions in Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion.


Every mission in Destiny 2: The Final Shape expansion


In total, there are eight main missions you must complete before completing the Final Shape campaign. There's more to it than that, however, which we'll discuss further below. For now, here's every mission in order:



Transmigration


Temptation


Exegesis


Requiem


Ascent


Dissent


Iconoclasm


Final Mission (locked behind the Salvation's Edge raid)



The final mission is a little confusing since we're currently unsure if this is referring to the World First clear of the raid, or if you're required to complete the raid yourself to experience the final chapter in the story. Once we have more details on it, we'll update this guide to reflect that.


All in all, this should take around 10 hours for the average player to complete. Weaved in between each of the above missions are some added side activities, such as speaking with your Ghost, conversing with your fireteam, or completing open-world content like Lost Sectors and Strikes. If you're playing in Normal mode, this may go by a little faster. It can also go a bit faster with a fire team of three people.

Initially released on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer console in 1995, it received a port to PC in 1996. It’s an underappreciated gem that could use a polish and a second chance.


One thing that struck me in the recent trailer is just how much of an upgrade the new enemy sprites and textures look. Their remaster of Star Wars: Dark Forces was already an impressive touch-up, but the assets in Killing Time struck me as something that would be more difficult to really improve. Many of the enemies are digitized actors – pictures of people in costume. Others are 3D models turned into 2D sprites. How do you improve these without losing the feel of the originals?

        <updated>2024-06-07T14:46:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has reportedly removed the 8K logo from its PlayStation 5 boxes. The PS5 box has been displaying the 8K logo ever since the console’s release in 2020. It only took the company four years to remove claims about the (so far) non-existent feature of the console.


The change was spotted by a Reddit user (reported first by PlayStation Lifestyle), who posted images of two PS5 boxes in comparison, where one had the 8K logo but it was missing from the updated PS5 box.




Sony’s FAQ blog in 2020 mentioned that the 8K display would arrive later with a system software update, but four years later, an update that enables this functionality for the PS5 is still missing. Sony senior vice president Naomi Matsuoka reportedly said earlier in February this year, that the PS5 has entered the “latter stages” of its life cycle. With PS5 now out for four years, and apparently entering its twilight years, the 8K resolution might not be arriving for the PS5 after all.


However, fans believe that the long-rumoured PS5 Pro might receive 8K resolution as one of the features, which may explain why Sony has decided to remove the label from PS5 so that the PS5 Pro can be marketed as an 8K supported console instead. While the situation is upsetting for PlayStation users, the feeling is likely mutual for Xbox Series X owners as well. Microsoft also claims that the Xbox Series X supports 8K display as well, but the feature is similarly locked behind a system update.


As it stands, the 8K display is not on the standard PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X console. Given that the 8K display resolution has not become mainstream in gaming or entertainment, and with few 8K TVs on the market, it seems like it will be some time before 8K becomes a household name like 4K is at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As per usual, Destiny 2's latest major DLC - The Final Shape - comes with a rather impressive list of new Legendary gear to collect, and the Dealer's Choice weapons, in particular, are a delightful highlight. How do you get unlock the full set, though? Further, how do you farm new rolls?


Whereas farming the Lightfall weapon set was a bit of a pain by default, this thankfully isn't the case with The Final Shape's new Pale Heart gear. Certainly, it will take time to farm all the right Perk rolls and complete all the side-missions that open up after you've wrapped up the main campaign, but the good news is that getting the Dealer's Choice weapons is going to be way more straightforward that we've gotten used to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hint: it's quite a bit.
Have you ever wondered how much it would actually cost publishers to showcase a trailer at Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase? Well, probably not. But you're here now, which means you're likely just a little bit curious, right?
Thanks to Esquire (via Eurogamer), the costs for game trailers have been revealed, and it ain't cheap, folks. Basically, publishers looking to showcase a one-minute trailer will need to fork up $250,000. Add 30 seconds and you're looking at $350,000. Two minutes is $450,000, and two-and-a-half minutes is $550,000.

        <updated>2024-06-07T14:25:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The end of Eden Zero draws near. After a couple more chapters, Shiki Granbell will have finished his grand quest -- concluding Hiro Mashima's space odyssey. To avoid spoilers, I'll leave out direct story elements from this article. Here is everything to know regarding Edens Zero chapter 291. 


When does Edens Zero chapter 291 come out? 


According to Weekly Shonen Magazine, Edens Zero chapter 291 releases June 11, 2024. As a part of Weekly Shonen Magazine, Eden Zero's new chapter release date is the day a new magazine issue drops. The speculated release time is 8 am PST, which aligns with the previous week's release. 


Weekly Shonen Magazine is released every Wednesday in Japan, which is Tuesday in the United States. Therefore, as long as there are no unscheduled delays, the Edens Zero chapter 291 release date is on June 11. 


For those wanting to read the new chapter for free on the official website, you can check in on the kmanga's official site on June 16, 2024. This is five days after its initial release. You can also read it as part of a volume set 29, which releases on June 25, 2024. 


What to expect


Speculating from the volume 29 release date, it seems we have three more chapters left before Eden Zero ends. This includes chapter 291, putting the last chapter at chapter 293. Rather than prolonging the series' life, like how he did with Fairy Tail, Hiro Mashima is approaching Edens Zero closer to how he approached Rave Master. In essence, he's going for a concise story rather than a drawn-out one. 




Even after Edens Zero ends, fans will likely see many of the characters again in the near future. Hiro Mashima has a tendency to recycle character designs and concepts in his future series. Therefore, although we will soon have to say goodbye to the series, we may not have to bid our farewells to all the characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given Mega Man’s enormous presence on classic Nintendo consoles, it’s surprising that the only game available on the Nintendo Switch Online libraries has been Mega Man: The Wily Wars…for Sega Genesis. That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.
Right now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:
Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge
Mega Man II
Mega Man III
Mega Man IV
Mega Man V


For those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware.

There’s at least one level in it that feels like essay-bait, so I’m obliging. The centerpiece of Mars Core - the FPS’  best level - is a comically massive superweapon called the BFG-10000. Oh, Chekov. If only you could see what we’ve done with your wisdom. The literary subtlety to gun-big-enough-to-scar-planets pipeline will eventually subsume all of pop culture, and those of us who chose to specialise writing about headshots will alternate between grins and tears from the wreckage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First introduced in Call of Duty: Black Ops, Theater Mode allowed players to record clips, piece them together, and then upload them directly from the menus. In future iterations, the feature also made it possible to watch back Zombies and Blackout matches and create clips. For the first time in a few years, it appears that the beloved feature could be making a return. 


Call of Duty leaker Bob claims that Theater Mode will return in Black Ops 6. Theater mode works similar to the spectator mode used in Call of Duty League matches. Players can save gameplay, take screenshots, fast-forward, pause, and rewind videos. The feature will make it possible to rewind a match from any perspective on the map, allowing users to take notes and learn where they made mistakes. 




In addition, the feature will be useful for the community in weeding out cheaters. Streamers already have the capability of rewinding their stream to determine if an enemy cheated or not. Theater Mode should make it easier for every player to do the same. Of course, this also comes with risks, as false accusations will inevitably be made and posted online. Treyarch is going to have its hands full sifting through so many videos, but this feature should have a positive impact and result in plenty of fun highlight reels going viral. 


We will learn more about the upcoming series installment during the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct on June 9 at 1 p.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is plumbing the depths of the Blue Bomber's portable efforts this week. All five Mega Man Game Boy games launched simultaneously via Nintendo Switch Online, and are now available for those who have a subscription.


The games included in the drop are Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, Mega Man II, Mega Man III, Mega Man IV, and Mega Man V. You just need the basic Nintendo Switch Online paid membership to dive in, so no worries for those who haven't ponied up for the Expansion Pass version. You can relive all the green-tinted glory in Nintendo's June 2024 Game Updates trailer below.




Starting with Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge in 1991—known as Rockman World in Japan—the Game Boy takes on Capcom's NES platformers were actually pretty impressive efforts. Many of them can be seen as remixes of sorts, with the first challenging players to four Robot Master stages from the original Mega Man, followed by fights with four Robot Masters from Mega Man 2 within the treacherous halls of Wily Castle. 


Mega Man II mixes content from the second and third NES games, so you can see a pattern developing. The series came to a close with Mega Man V in 1994, featuring Super Game Boy support and, in a first for the Game Boy entries, a totally fresh story with new levels, bosses, and weapons. 


All of the games have their awkward aspects, but they're absolutely worth firing up if you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. And hey, it beats paying exorbitant eBay prices for complete versions of these bite-sized bad boys. Now we'll just patiently wait for Nintendo to expand Switch Online support to include the DOS version of Mega Man 3.

        <updated>2024-06-07T13:34:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the next-gen update of Fallout 4 that rolled out in April, the long-awaited and unofficial expansion Fallout: London had to delay release. This was a sad time for those who were eagerly awaiting the DLC-sized mod, but it looks like good news is on the way.


In a recent post on Twitter/X, the team behind Fallout: London has said that they "have a new date." That doesn't really clue us in much, but it at least lets us know that a launch day is likely on the horizon.




Diving a little deeper, a message on the mod's Discord channel (as spotted by VG247) says the developer just has "one more I to dot and one last T to cross," before it's due for release. The message then goes on to say that "we are looking at a matter of days/weeks" and that fans should "stay tuned."


Far out


Fallout aficionados have no doubt been paying close attention to this ambitious fan-made project, which tells the tale of a post-apocalyptic wasteland from the perspective of the UK capital city. We've had plenty of teasers about the mod, which promises new factions, weapons, as well as a slew of quests.


Fallout: London had already been pushed back before, originally set to come out at the end of 2023. However, the team ultimately decided to delay release at that point so as not to clash with Starfield. With the launch of the Fallout 4 next-gen upgrade, it seems Bethesda has been getting in the way of the mod on more than one occasion, albeit maybe not intentionally.


At any rate, it looks as though the long, hard road is finally coming to an end. London sounds like it's going to be a huge addition to F4, and the extra delay will hopefully be worth it in the end. I'm calling it right now: I think it's going to be phenomenal.

By any measure, the Switch has been a rousing success. It has outsold and outlasted almost every gaming console ever made, but according to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, its days are now numbered.
Rumors aside, we don’t know exactly what form the “Switch successor” will take, nor even what it will be called. But one thing we know for sure is that it will play games.

Ahead of Antonblast's launch later this year on 12th November 2024, developer Summitsphere has released the game's opening cutscene, and it's pretty great.
It showcases Satan (naturally) who, after conversing with a magical mirror, discovers that there is a 'red guy' who happens to 'shine more crimson' than he. This, of course, is our protagonist, Dynamite Anton, so poor ol' Satan decides to take what Anton loves the most, coax him into his lair, and 'siphon his delightfully rosy tone'.

So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.

Last year, we caught our first glimpse of Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire, an upcoming JRPG from PQube and Octeto Studios which wears its Skies of Arcadia inspiration proudly on its sleeve. Well, it popped up again at yesterday's Guerilla Collective. This time with a brand-new gameplay trailer.
The fresh footage gives a pretty good idea of what this one will have in store for us when it lands on Switch later this year (a more precise date still hasn't been revealed). We get to see the turn-based sky battles in action, catch a glimpse of the crew recruitment process and check out some of the ship customisation options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Sobaka Studio has revealed Kiborg: Arena, a roguelike that looks like a cyberpunk Sifu. Revealed during today's Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. 
In the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. "Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow." It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. 
Check out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:


In Arena, players find "Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma's Colisseum. Here, Morgan's clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going." Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.
In the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. 
Here are some Kiborg screenshots: 

Arena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The full Kiborg game does not yet have a release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Playtonic has revealed Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of its 2017 platformer Yooka-Laylee. It revealed this during today's Guerrilla Collective 2024 Showcase with a new trailer that highlighted the game's new visuals, improved camera and gameplay controls, remixed challenges, and more. 
"Embark on an epic open-world 3D platforming collectathon adventure with Yooka and Laylee," the game's description reads. "The search for Pagies starts anew in Yooka-Replaylee, the enhanced definitive version of the beloved indie darling with all new challenges, secrets, mechanics, and accessibility options." 
Check it out for yourself in the Yooka-Replaylee reveal trailer below: 


Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Wii U, and PC, and we had a great time with it – you can read why in Game Informer's Yooka-Laylee review. Though the game is a 3D collect-a-thon, it got a sequel in 2019 called Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair that played more like Donkey Kong Country. 
Yooka-Replaylee is coming to PC and unspecified consoles. It has no release window.

It’s a light and breezy ocean cleanup game that has you sailing a cute lil’ boat around polluted seas, cleansing oil patches and scooping up plastic bottles. Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of PowerWash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got our first look at Firewalk Studios' upcoming 5v5 first-person shooter Concord last week during a PlayStation State of Play, which is where we also learned it will launch simultaneously on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23 after a beta this July. Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game's preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. 
That same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will "expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates" for all players at no additional cost. 
Here's a look at the Concord box art: 
Alongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game's August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. 
Here's a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: 
"Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there's no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself," the blog post reads. "That's why we're hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord." 
That beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Angry Birds Movie 3 is officially in production. The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.
Red and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. 
A press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already. 
While we wait for more information on the film, you can read our review of The Angry Birds Movie 2 here. You can also read the latest news on other upcoming video game films, such as Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Nintendo's live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, Mortal Kombat 2, Minecraft, and Borderlands.]]></summary>

If you happen to recall the bizarre 1999 point-and-click title Garage: Bad Dream Adventure, then you're in for a treat. If you don't, then... well... you're still in for a treat because it looks wild.
It launches on the Switch eShop today for £16.99 / $24.99, so by the time you're reading this, you might be able to purchase and download it. For the uninitiated, Garage originated in Japan from developer Kinotrope and was released for Windows and Mac. It's since been ported to Android and iOS, but we're honestly thrilled to see it on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the live-service multiplayer game from famed Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC back in February to middling reviews and disappointment from players. Now, a new report from Bloomberg details the game's behind-the-scenes troubles, including a culture of "toxic positivity," shifting visions, and more, ultimately resulting in the game being a $200 million loss for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. 
Bloomberg reports that following the release of DC's Suicide Squad in 2016, which made $750 million at the box office on a budget of $175 million, Warner Bros. wanted to build on that IP's success. Warner Bros. Montreal, which developed 2022's Gotham Knights, was working on a Suicide Squad game …]]></summary>

Since the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched in 2013, gamers have increasingly been given the option to tweak their experiences based on whether they prefer higher image quality or smoother performance.
Not all developers offer this, but now that we're more than three-and-a-half years into the lifespan of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, player expectations have adjusted accordingly to the point where it almost feels mandatory to include 'Quality' and 'Performance' options in the biggest games on those platforms. It's why you see almost constant requests for a re-release of Bloodborne, a game that is infamously capped at 30fps on PS4, with Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2 being a close second.

        <updated>2024-06-06T12:34:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year's Octopath Traveler II is now available on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Square Enix has announced. Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms. 
If you're on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you've been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in Game Informer's Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer's Octopath Traveler II review. 


To celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an "Extra Battle" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. 
"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds," a press release reads. "Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taipei’s annual Computex event is always a big, circled, triple-underlined mark in the PC gaming hardware calendar. Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

Ahead of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's launch on 14th June 2024, Atlus has revealed the epic launch trailer, likely giving fans one last look at the game before release.
It's arguably a bit spoiler-heavy for some, so you'll have to judge whether you want to check it out. Regardless, if you weren't already hyped for the upcoming release, the launch trailer will almost certainly push you over the edge.

But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!
First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it's adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.
The Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. 
“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”
Even though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be "quite big" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.
HBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” 
For those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.

Hauntii drew me in immediately thanks to its striking illustrated art direction and enchanting jazz noir soundtrack. A powerful opening sees the protagonist, an adorable ghost who recently died, attempting to ascend to a heavenly plane hand in hand with an angel-like guardian, only to be shackled and pulled back to the depths of Eternity. It’s an emotionally effective moment, and while the gameplay doesn’t always prove as captivating, it provides enough thrills to propel through an eye-popping…]]></summary>

Elsewhere, the statement could've been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie's relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silkbulb Test is a game in which, going by its demo, you are strapped to a chair and made to answer questions projected onto a screen. You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as "is this a door?" accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there's stuff like "Are you alone?" and "Is it safe to be alone?" and "You are alone" and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision'd your way through. I like what I've played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and 'form your own opinions'. Pah.

It's like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe's heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven't had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.

Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. The Alters is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a "quantum computer", splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

Back in 2015, I sat down with fighting game community staple and former Capcom employee Seth Killian for a demo of the first game from Radiant Entertainment – his then-newly founded indie studio – Rising Thunder. The title, which featured robots fighting one another, aimed to give players a 2D fighter with simple controls and little barrier to entry. Rising Thunder showed a ton of promise, so much so that League of Legends developer Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment in 2016. This led to the cancellation of Rising Thunder, which was at that point in alpha, with many of the core tenets transferrin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devolver Digital has released an intriguing teaser for what appears to be a new project by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine. The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.
Heart Machine is currently working on Hyper Light Breaker, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver's teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine's logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.


The Devolver Direct airs on June 7 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. You can keep up with the other summer showcases with our evolving schedule of events. For more on Heart Machine, check out our extended preview for Hyper Light Breaker and our reviews of Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter.]]></summary>

Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and "small interactive moments" I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I've played a portion of Elden Ring's expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and I think it's brilliant. But there's one thing I didn't flesh out in the preview and that's the DLC's standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

But I'll obviously try and not be too spoilery for those who've decided to keep reading this, and hence, probably aren't as SPOILER sensitive. Right, onwards.
Life In Jars is this YouTuber I've followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He'll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It's a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, I can't help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

I love Elden Ring. I played it for more than 150 hours. It was also my 2022 game of the year by a nautical mile. I loved it so much that I wrote a whole piece on having what I dubbed “post-Elden Ring depression.” That’s why its upcoming expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, has been among my most anticipated games of 2024 and why I couldn’t wait to fly out to Los Angeles to play the first hands-on demo. Taking place in a special venue in the heart of the famous Hollywood Forever Cemetery (you read that right), I spent three hours freely roaming a po…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception. Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been one month since the sound of engines began. The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today's puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn't aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a "means of fun". Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Honestly, I turn my back on shooter-of-note Helldivers 2 for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. "You" being the players who completed the metagame's last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental "Dark Fluid" - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.
Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We'll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After teasing PC support tests earlier this year, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation's online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx. 
Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn't happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like Fallout 4 VR and War Thunder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.
The new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.


Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder's Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game's soundtrack. 
When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today's trailer confirms that it's also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-03T13:48:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.
As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. 
Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+


We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, "Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits." The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021.

Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q & A. "There will be, definitely, new announcements," he said, "but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans." He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week, on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it's been more than two years since its reveal. 
However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. 
"People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don't know why," Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. "I think it's because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping." 
Here's a clip of it, too:

Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the "but you guys can keep hoping" part at the end, but it's more likely that he's trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. 
In the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series' future with Final Fantasy, and more. 
Do you think we'll hear about Kingdom Hearts IV this upcoming weekend? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The "shells" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it's still streaming channels right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys for Bob, the developer of Crash Bandicoot 4 and the Skylanders series, has announced a publishing deal with Xbox for its next game. The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The studio states its new title is "very early in development" and that we won't see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn't surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about!

May 31, 2024
Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

Skald is terrific.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I fear we may have swum the Rubicon of diminishing returns where multiplayer horror games inspired by Lethal Company are concerned. The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It's got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage 'em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Sony's PlayStation State of Play, new gameplay and details were shared for Marvel Rivals. For the uninitiated. Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man's Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares III, the horror action platformer from Supermassive Games, has moved into 2025. The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, "As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber.

Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.

Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

        <updated>2024-05-30T23:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is "styling," which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the "save the world" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you'd expect.
The trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the "high tension shooter" tasks players with exploring an "overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan." 
"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends," the blog post reads. "While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been "rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC." Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro's Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro's Playroom can be found here.]]></summary>

Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you've played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today's State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation's recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while "tentpole" single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game's Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: "You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way."
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-30T22:03:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we're inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game's release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant's leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below. 
Trunks (Kid)

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features here.]]></summary>

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot' Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not. 
This comes from one of PlayStation's dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation's single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it's part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


"Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here," Hulst said. "On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…]]></summary>

I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it's a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-5-generation-is-already-sonys-most-profitable-yet"/>
        <updated>2024-05-30T13:42:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its "Game & Network Services Segment" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. 
For more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games.

This isn't the first time the over-the-top explode 'em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it's been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has announced a partnership with Mojang Studios to create a new animated series based on Minecraft. The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.
WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be "showing the world of Minecraft in a new light" and feature an original story with new characters.


This won't be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.]]></summary>

I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month's lightning rod for hype. But it's worth dissecting what it's actually like to play.

To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it's just plain fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate.

Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it's rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery "video game", which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game's crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was "normal" and "appropriate".

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out.
