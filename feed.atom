After launching on Steam last May and landing an ESRB rating last month, Red Hook Studios' spooky roguelike Darkest Dungeon II is finally making its way onto Switch on 15th July.
This one will see you embarking on a journey through a decaying wasteland in the hope of preventing the apocalypse — no pressure there then, eh? You'll be building a party and working through five different 'Confessions', each with its own challenges and bosses.

The situation is extremely dire, as even critical acclaim and a fair degree of commercial success won't guarantee the survival of your job or company — even if it's in the hands of multibillion dollar companies like Microsoft and Embracer Group.

The Chicken error code in Destiny 2 is bizarre because the reasoning behind it doesn't seem to line up with when players experience it. I've found this firsthand because the error is, broadly speaking, linked to your connection to the internet. However, I only saw it when my connection was fine, which leads me to believe it might be a bit of a catch-all for various problems around updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC is the latest addition to Ultimate Team, and the Austrian wingback now has a new special item. 


EA Sports has introduced Posch's promo card as part of a special challenge, which will be great news for the community. As long as you complete all the tasks (there's just one) before the expiry of the SBC, the new card will be added to your Ultimate Team inventory. 


EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC tasks


There might be just one task, but it has certain conditions. These conditions must be satisfied during squad submission in order to earn the Make Your Mark card.


Task 1 - Stefan Posch



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 84



Only use a TOTS item to complete this challenge if you have a duplicate card that can be used elsewhere. 


EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC cheapest solutions


The EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC has only one task, so it won't cost too much to complete. Nevertheless, there are plenty of great SBCs like Alejandro Garnacho Make Your Mark to finish in Ultimate Team, so save as much in-game resources as possible. 


Task 1 - Stefan Posch



Thiago Alcantara 84


Stanislav Lobotka 84


Memphis Depay 84


Thomas Muller 84


Ismael Bennacer 84


Casey Stanway 84


Serge Gnabry 84


Griedge Mbock 84


Any 84-rated TOTS item


Luis Alberto 84


Franco Acerbi 83



The 93-rated RB item, which can also play as a CB and RWB, has the Anticipate+ and Intercept+ playstyles. This is a must complete for all beginners due to the available playstyles. Posch is also a starter for Austria, and the card might become an absolute bargain with upgrades. 


If you already have the extra fodder, this SBC could be well worth the fodder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wouldn't be a new Warframe update if there weren't a handful of new materials for you to collect. Duviri Paradox is the best example of a recent update that introduced a lot of materials, but each update tends to include a couple. The release of Jade Shadows is no different, and how you can use them can be a little confusing. Here's what Vestigial and Volatile Motes are in Warframe.


How to get and use Vestigial and Volatile Motes in Warframe


Vestigial and Volatile Motes are acquired from the new Ascension game mode, accessible through the node Brutus, Uranus. During the mission, you'll fight various enemies that will occasionally drop Vestigial or Volatile Motes, which can then be picked up. These come in at a few each run but typically give you more Vestigial Motes than Volatile.

These need to be taken to the Larunda Relay orbiting Mercury. Once there, you want to head to Ordis, who's found in the Mission Control room on the right side of the relay. Alternatively, you can use the Fast Travel option in the Pause Menu to go straight to Ordis. Here, you're able to access several shops. The Release Vestigial Motes shop lets you access Jade's component blueprints alongside other useful items such as Arcanes. Other shops let you spend your Volatile Motes on other assorted items, including several cosmetics.

Be mindful that Volatile Motes are only available as part of the Operation: Belly of the Beast event that launched with the Jade Shadows update. Once the Operation disappears, only Vestigial Motes will be earnable. If you want some of the cosmetics in Ordis' shop, you'll need to move fast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While not every Warframe update includes one, the updates that include new cinematic quests tend to be the most interesting ones. Between updates like The New War, Whispers in the Walls, and now Jade Shadows stick out more when you need to deal with story tidbits and cool setpieces instead of a new mission type to farm. Here's how to access the latest main story quest for Warframe, known aptly as Jade Shadows.


How to play the Jade Shadows main quest in Warframe

The Jade Shadows quest becomes accessible after completing the New War main quest. This will require a lot of other quests to be completed beforehand, mostly centered around the main story. If you're only partway through, you should focus on that instead of concerning yourself with most of the new update. However, those who have completed The New War can access the quest through the kiosk on the left of the Orbiter's cockpit. Find the Jade Shadows quest in the menu, click on it, and select Begin in the bottom right.


If you are going to jump into the quest, there are a few things you should keep in mind. The mission is 30-40 minutes long depending on how quickly you tend to speed through content. You also won't be able to access the rest of the game until the mission is complete, so you should get anything else you want done taken care of now.


Upon completion, you'll get a handful of nice cosmetics along with the Jade main blueprint, granting you access to her provided you have her parts already. If you don't, they can be acquired through the new Ascension game mode on the node Brutus, Uranus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3 introduces numerous events and features, from the Metallica and Fallout collaborations to expanding the in-game map to include a few new locations. You'll also spot several weapons, with a powerful laser gun among your many options. Here's how to get the Tri-Beam laser rifle in Fortnite.


Where to get the Tri-Beam Laser Rifle in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3


The main ways to get the Tri-Beam laser rifle is to find it as floor or chest loot or eliminate an enemy wielding one. While this is luck-dependent, you'll often find one if you encounter a lot of other players or frequently loot chests, as it's a relatively common drop compared to legendary and mythic-grade weapons. Similarly, if someone else got lucky and found, you can defeat the min combat and quickly pick up their laser rifle to take it for yourself.

Alternatively, you can also talk to the T-60 Power Armor NPC between the Nitrodrome and Mount Olympus. You'll spot the character in a small shack, where they'll sell you the Tri-Beam laser rifle for 300 gold bars. If you have enough gold bars on you, you can buy the gun to use it instantly, allowing you to get started on your quests early on. Just be careful while doing this, as you might find other players also trying to get the rifle.

Once you get your hands on the Tri-Beam laser rifle, you can use it to complete weekly quests, progress through seasonal missions, or try something new. While the gun doesn't boast any special abilities, it has unlimited ammo and decently high damage, making it a good option throughout most of your match.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Aces is billed as “a vision of the future for real-time strategy” but if you glance at a screen, you might think you’re staring into the past: another toonified science fiction world of scuffed, shiny nodules, lanes and arenas, an overly functional colour scheme, and hotkeyed hordes of little and large units that appear devoid of personality, even by top-down generalissimo standards. Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. "Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too," notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. "So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those viewers who were left feeling a little confused by the reveal of Sutekh in the latest episode of Doctor Who, The Legend of Ruby Sunday, there is hope in the shape of Tales of the TARDIS. 


Tales of the TARDIS was originally created to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the show, and usually features previous iterations of the Doctor and their corresponding companions on board the Memory TARDIS, a TARDIS which features significant items and designs from every generation of Doctor Who. However, this week’s episode will be slightly different as the Doctor and Ruby enter the Memory TARDIS and travel back in time to 1911. 


Viewers will be able to get some answers as to who Sutekh is, accompanied by the Doctor and Ruby as they take a pause in events currently happening and take some time to consider what they've been through over the last few weeks.

According to the BBC, the “timeless classic” Pyramids of Mars has been turned into feature-length omnibus episode with updated visuals and a cosmic makeover. Taking multiple episodes and condensing them into the 75 minute run-time of Tales of the TARDIS is no mean feat, but it should provide some answers for those who still have questions regarding Sutekh. 


There have previously been seven episodes of Tales of the TARDIS, looking back on everything from the Cybermen to Viking curses, though this will be the first time we’ve seen a current Doctor experiencing events of his previous regenerations. With Empire of Death being released just one day later, this might be the last chance to catch up on exactly who Sutekh is, and why he's so dangerous.


Tales of the TARDIS will air live on BBC4 in the UK on June 20 at 8 p.m. GMT, and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer at any time after that point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Games announced today that the NCSOFT-developed MMORPG Throne and Liberty finally has a global release date and it is September 17, 2024. Originally titled Project TL, Throne and Liberty is seen by many as somewhat of a spiritual successor to NCSOFT's popular Lineage MMORPG series. The MMO has already been released in South Korea, but has been receiving some updates and changes before Amazon Games brought it to the global audience.




Throne of Liberty features a dynamic PvP system that focuses on conquest battles and castle sieges. Winning these battles allows guilds to get valuable buffs and guild resources that increase the guilds ability to compete in PvE as well, creating a system where all facets of gameplay benefit each other.


The Castle Siege system is said to support thousands of players as they fight over a castle, using unique strategic resources such as Golems to join them in the fight.



In Throne and Liberty, there are numerous goals that can be achieved through guilds, including guild rankings, Conquest Battles, and Castle Sieges. Guilds are at the core of strategic competitive battles. Guild members not only work together to achieve common goals, but also benefit from a guild reward system that includes distributing raid items and sharing rewards from events among members. However, the greatest appeal of a guild is the sense of belonging it provides, ensuring that you always have companions by your side.
- Moonseop Lee, Game Design Director at NCSOFT



Amazon Games also announced an upcoming open beta taking place from July 18 to July 23 on all platforms with cross-play enabled.


Throne and Liberty will release on September 17 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S and will feature cross-platform play across all three platforms.

However, a lot of community members have recently voluntarily switched to playing the old-gen version on their next-gen consoles (this isn't possible on PC). At first, doing so might seem counter-intuitive, as the current-gen version has plenty of added advantages and new technology like HyperMotion. However, certain benefits come with the older version, especially if you're frustrated with how HyperMotion works in the game.

You'd be forgiven for thinking that today's Nintendo Direct was a co-production between Nintendo and Square Enix, what with the plethora of reveals from both companies. And Square Enix's final announcement from today's Direct was a surprise — a full remake of SNES RPG Romancing SaGa 2, which comes to Switch on 24th October 2024.
Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven brings the 1993 classic into full 3D, but it goes beyond just a simple visual update. Kenji Ito's iconic soundtrack has been fully rearranged by the man himself (though the original tracks are also available). There will also be voice acting, both in English and Japanese, tweaks to the battle system, and an updated 'timeline' system.

Yet despite the amount of complaints lobbied against them, it sounds like Capcom has no plans to adjust the microtransactions.


Recently, Kotaku got to speak with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto, and it asked them about the discontent surrounding the microtransactions.

Well folks, the wait is over. More than seven years since its initial announcement, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has been fully revealed during the latest Nintendo Direct, and it looks incredible.
The trailer doesn't reveal too much, but we've got confirmation that many of Samus' core abilities from the original trilogy return, including the morph ball, missiles, charge beam, scanning, and the lock-on/strafe mechanic. We also got a glimpse at Sylux, the illusive antagonist who we briefly saw in Metroid Prime: Federation Force, along with a bunch of Space Pirates and Metroids.

Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts. It is… a lot. It's too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

A few problems remain, but it's good stuff all around, and the whole Arrowhead Games studio is to blame for this.


The concept of "blame" is, of course, quite positive in this case, and the recently self-deposed former CEO of Arrowhead Games, Johan Pilestedt, has gone on record to make sure that Helldivers 2 players understand that the great new update was a team effort through and through. Specifically, Pilestedt says he had noticed some people giving him virtually all the credit for the Viper Commandos update, and he wanted to clear the air on this matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in September 2023, GameCube card-based RPG duology Baten Kaitos made its way back to a Nintendo platform with the launch of Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. While it may have been easy to miss last night's announcement, the collection is now available on Steam.


The Steam drop of the remastered set — which includes Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and Baten Kaitos Origins — is priced at $49.99. Those who pick it up between now and July 1 will get upgraded to the Month 1 Edition, which packs the games with a digital art book. As Bandai Namco details, the art book includes "concept art, character designs, historical documents, and the latest visuals" for both games. All of the content within is in Japanese. 




Baten Kaitos series character designer Nakaba Higurashi whipped up a new illustration to commemorate the Steam release.


In addition to updated visuals, the remastered versions of the Baten Kaitos games add in some progression-focused features for those who just want to experience the story. There's the ability to turn on No Encounters so you can sail through the game without having to worry about battles. If you want to fight but don't want battles to impede progress, there's also an Instant KO setting that lets you defeat enemies in a single attack.

Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster is 10 percent off on Steam for a limited time, so if you want to grab it now, you can do so for $44.99.

I suppose it does make some sense since the crossover is specifically with the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers team, whose giant Zords took the form of prehistoric creatures, like a tyrannosaurus rex and a saber-toothed tiger. It's also a mod that's completely free to download, letting you dress your character up as one of the five original Rangers, complete with unique animations, and there are even optional skins for your weapons and specific dinosaurs, turning them into the Dinozords.

The publisher is broadcasting a new Nintendo Direct, airing roughly 40 minutes of news about upcoming Switch games, though there won't be any mention of the console's successor here.


Instead, what we're likely to see is the twilight roll-out of the Switch's library. A few new games, a few old ones, and maybe the return of a long-lost giant, hiding away for years in Nintendo R&D. Here's everything we saw today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today's Nintendo Direct, Square Enix revealed the open RPG Romancing SaGa 2, originally released back in 1993, has gotten the full remake treatment. The Romancing SaGa series allows players to forge their own stories as they choose from an arsenal of main characters and expand their legacy, passing down powers and skills with each generation. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is headed to Switch on October 24, 2024.




Based on the trailer, it looks like Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven features some pretty substantial upgrades both graphically and gameplay-wise.


In Romancing Saga 2 players must oversee a Royal Court, leading an empire to longevity and prosperity by dictating its economy, technology, city construction, and magic. At its core, Romancing SaGa 2 is about prospering over generations as opposed to focusing on the short term.


This is another one I've yet to play, primarily because it was originally released in Japan and I just never got around to playing. It looks like a great time to finally get into it with the Revenge of the Seven remake.


Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch on October 24, 2024.

      <p>In The Hundred Line you are Takumi Sumino, a student who is suddenly enrolled at the The Last Defense Academy when an outbreak of monsters threatens his life and the lives of his fellow students. Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.</p>

Capcom has been really good to Ace Attorney fans over the years, delivering multiple collections - including games that have never been released in the West before — to console owners. And during today's Nintendo Direct, the Ace Attorney developer revealed it's bringing the final missing piece to the rest of the world.
Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is coming to Switch on 6th September 2024 and bundles together two DS adventures starring prosecutor and fan favourite character Miles Edgeworth. Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth made it to the West back in 2010, but the sequel — Ace Attorney Investigations 2 — never left Japan. At least, until now, and with a new title — Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit.

Ahead of the launch of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, Miyazaki sat down with GameSpot to discuss Elden Ring's development and the future of FromSoftware. When asked if open world games will now serve as a new baseline for the studio, Miyazaki downplayed the possibility: "I wouldn't necessarily say that open world is going to become the new base or foundation or standard of the company. ...

      <p>For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she's become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.</p>

      <p>We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one last thing of today’s Nintendo Direct is none other than the elusive Metroid Prime 4. Announced back in (holy crap) 2017, this is the first time we’ve actually seen gameplay. It will be arriving in 2025.


I’d say I was shocked, but they had to show it at some point. The gameplay shown off looks a lot like the Metroid Prime we’ve become accustomed to. There's even series' antagonist, Dark Samus, stepping in at the end.


Samus is in her classic Varia suit (setting it before Metroid Fusion) and can roll into a ball. It looks like lock-on aiming has returned, which means it will feel natural to me. Rejoice! Scanning is back. The trailer opens with a battle between Federation soldiers and the Space Pirates, but it closes with a look at a more peaceful environment that could be taken straight from a JRPG.


Anyway, take a look for yourself:




Metroid Prime 4 is coming to Switch sometime in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearing the end of the 2024 Nintendo Direct, Spike Chunsoft, the creators of the Danganronpa series, announced their latest game, The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy. The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- is arriving as a Nintendo Switch exclusive in early 2025.




Boasting Danganronpa's signature art style and narrative parallels, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- takes place in an apocalyptic world where mysterious, hostile creatures are invading. Playing as the protagonist, Takumi Sumino, your goal is to survive 100 days as you and your fellow classmates defend your school against these creatures. 


Right from the get-go, we see its resemblance to previous Spike Chunsoft games like those from the Danganronpa series. Some of the most notable similarities are the existence of a small animal mascot, the forced enrolment of 16 students in a questionable school, and the collapse of society as monsters destroy everything in their path. The premise is the same outside of the absence of murder mystery and case-solving, but its gameplay is vastly different.

Rather than being a primarily visual novel-based game, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- features a combat grid where you'll arrange your characters and defeat waves of enemies, with things getting increasingly challenging as you progress through the 100 days. While little is known about the specifics of gameplay and combat, we at least know there's some variety here. 


The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- will launch on Nintendo Switch in early 2025. No exact release date is currently known.

Nintendo has finally revealed Metroid Prime 4, and it's now called Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. It's planned for release in 2025 and we've got our first look via a new gameplay trailer.
It definitely looks like classic Metroid Prime! Scanning makes a return, Sylux is causing trouble again, and all the usual hallmarks, including missiles, lock-on, and the Morph Ball are present and correct. It's incredibly cinematic though, really making use of the Switch's extra power. Though we wouldn't be surprised if this one winds up being cross-gen with the 'Switch 2'...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the previous Ace Attorney collections, Capcom is doing one for the Ace Attorney Investigations spin-off duology. Not only does this mean the two games will be available on modern hardware, but this marks the second game's debut in the West.


For context, the original Ace Attorney Investigations, which sees you play as prosecutor Miles Edgeworth as he solves crimes, came out in 2010. Its sequel launched just a year later in 2011, but only in Japan, with Capcom opting not to localise it. Fans did come together to make their own translation, but many had assumed the game would never officially come to the West.




Capcom seems eager to push Ace Attorney more nowadays, as evidenced by how all the mainline games are readily available. This includes The Great Ace Attorney duology, which was also Japan-only for many years. All in all, fans of the series are eating well.


This new collection will feature enhanced visuals, with more fluid and detail character animations, but there will be an option to switch to the original graphics as seen in the DS versions. Obviously, this won't be a Switch exclusive and will also launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Pre-orders are already available for the collection, which is scheduled to launch on September 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of a Zelda remake, which some fans may have expected, Nintendo surprised everyone with a brand new series entry, putting players in the princess's shoes instead. 


The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom announcement trailer started like any previous installment. Link battles off a horde of enemies to free Zelda from a crystal. However, this time around, Link gets sucked into a strange rift, and this time it's up to Zelda to step up to the plate and save Hyrule. Instead of wielding a sword, Zelda wields a mysterious staff that can duplicate items called echoes. Once the princess learns an echo of something she can re-create it however many times you like to help traverse the map and move past obstacles. 




Wooden boxes, old beds, tables, and water blocks are just a few items Zelda can use. The first trailer gives players a first look at how the duplication system works. For example, Zelda duplicated multiple beds to scale a wall. Instead of traditional combat, the staff can create echoes of monsters, and each enemy has a unique set of abilities that can be used for different situations. Nintendo set out to create an experience that will be different for players, based on how they decide to use echoes. 


The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches on September 26, 2024. Nintendo also announced a new Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule edition to celebrate the new title that will also be available on the same date.

Fortunately, you won't have to wait too long to jump into the friendship-making (and destroying) actions with your friends, as it's releasing this year on October 17, 2024.




Super Mario Party Jamboree is the biggest game to launch in the series yet, with over 110 minigames, seven game boards, and up to 20-player support in an exclusive Koopathlon mode. You'll jump onto an island resort and, much like previous games in the series, travel around the board to sabotage your friends and claim the most stars to win the match. It also features mostly new game boards, with two from the first two Mario Party games, Mario's Rainbow Castle and Western Land, making a grand return.


Super Mario Party Jamboree will be released as a Nintendo Switch exclusive on October 17, 2024.

This is extremely exciting to me. I’m always thrilled when old licensed games get re-released because I know it’s often a lot of hoops for the publisher to jump through. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 is probably the top of the heap, but that doesn’t mean that the others included aren’t great on their own. 


The more obscure entry here is The Punisher.  Rather than a fighting game,  it's a beat-’em-up where you play as the eponymous anti-hero and Nick Fury. It’s no Alien vs. Predator (hopefully, one day), but it’s appropriately violent and an excellent arcade title.


It comes with some bells and whistles, too. There will be Online modes with rollback netplay, and training modes for all the fighting games. There is also a spectator mode, a jukebox, and screen filters.


Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be released later this year for Switch, PS4, and PC.

Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was teased a few weeks ago by Square Enix, but during today's Nintendo Direct, we got oh, so much more news than just the one game.
First up, Dragon Quest III HD-2D will be launching on Switch on 14th November 2024. This one was initially revealed in the Dragon Quest 35th anniversary celebrations back in 2021, though recent rumours surrounding the game's contents had us wondering whether it might pop up soon enough. And pop up it has. The new trailer gives us another look at the stunning HD-2D visuals and showcases some of the animation changes that we'll be able to catch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the newest Nintendo Direct, four fan-favourite classics were confirmed to be coming to the Nintendo Switch's online service. And best of all, they're dropping later today.


The first two are a pair of Game Boy Advance games: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission for Game Boy Advance. The former is a compilation title that includes a GBA remake of the beloved SNES game A Link to the Past, and a multiplayer spin-off that sees four Links team up and explore randomised dungeons. This will allow for online co-op.

As for Metroid: Zero Mission, it's a GBA remake of the very first Metroid game, letting you experience an updated re-telling of Samus' first adventure. It may not be as fancy looking as Metroid Prime 4, but it's still worth playing.


The other two additions are a pair of Nintendo 64 games: Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Rare's original Perfect Dark. Both of these are first-person shooters, with Turok being all about, well, hunting dinosaurs, while Perfect Dark is set in an alternate future where agent Joanna Dark goes on a mission to thwart an evil corporation. Perfect Dark will also feature online multiplayer. These two will be exclusive to Nintendo's new catalogue of mature rated titles.

Developer Sunblink is bringing its cosy life sim adventure game Hello Kitty Island Adventure to Nintendo Switch in 2025 as a timed console exclusive. Revealed during today's Nintendo Direct, with the cutesy Sanrio + Animal Crossing vibes, we're absolutely keeping an eye on this one.
Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive which launched in 2023, it won Game of the Year on the service and is one of the most successful and popular games there. Now it's finally making the leap to consoles next year, and of course, Switch is the first port of call. Which makes sense, given the cute and cuddly vibes.

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.</p>

      <p>During today's Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.</p>

<p>Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.</p>

<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>Nintendo kicked off its June 2024 Nintendo Direct presentation with the surprise reveal of a new Mario &amp; Luigi game. This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a "seafaring adventure" that will include new evolved "Bros moves".</p>

<p>The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Board the Brothership.
Today's Nintendo Direct certainly started out with a banger surprise, didn't it? Nintendo revealed that a brand new Mario & Luigi game is in development — and it's launching on 7th November 2024 on Switch.
Mario & Luigi: Brothership is the first new entry in the Mario & Luigi RPG series, originally developed by AlphaDream, in quite some time. And it looks absolutely lovely. Taking place on Shipshape Island, the brothers will be navigating their way through the world of Concordia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, "It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it".
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Available physically and digitally.
Atari and WayForward Technologies have announced that the upcoming Metroidvania Yars Rising will be heading to the Nintendo Switch on 10th September 2024.
Initially announced during an Indie World showcase, Yars Rising is a brand new take on the classic Yars franchise, which began all the way back in 1982 with Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600. The new game goes in a decidedly different direction from the original, utilising WayForwards' flair for character-led adventure games by combining stealth mechanics with comprehensive hacking minigames.

      <p>Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.</p>

<p>Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.</p>

<p>Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="876adf32-d734-4ecc-a6ff-6656f84dde7b" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/09/the-coolest-games-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024-and-more">here</a>. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.</p>]]></summary>

Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn't that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there's a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.

It should come as no surprise that Nintendo is pretty protective regarding its IP. Going after emulators, ROM hacks, and reproductions is one thing, but it looks like the firm is starting to aim its sights on something rather surprising: sheet music.
According to two separate community posts on YouTube, it seems like Nintendo is looking to take down fan-arranged sheet music based on its franchises. The first is via the popular channel Sheet Music Boss, which states "In a classic Nintendo move they've DMCAed all of our *correctly licensed* sheet music", before expressing frustration toward the situation:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You forgot about Habbo Hotel, didn't you? Habbo Hotel. With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. "Habbo Hotel is back!" is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the "same" money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a forum post, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well done, young man.
The latest UK Charts are here and it's a resounding success for the newly released Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, which beats the likes of EA Sports FC 24 and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door to claim the top spot. Naturally, the game fared better on PS5, but the Switch performed admirably, pulling in a total of 27% of the overall sales.
Elsewhere, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Bros. Wonder maintain their presence in the top 10, while Minecraft is just about hanging in there after slipping from number 8 to number 10. Further down the list, Tears of the Kingdom has seen a slight boost in sales to land at number 17, while Mario vs. Donkey Kong climbs the vines to settle in at number 22.

      <p>Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT.

      <p>Elden Ring fans are likely counting down the seconds until the release of its hotly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion this Friday. For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1802579506479202486">X post</a>, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion's content online. The message reads:</p>

Greetings, Tarnished.

With the release of the expansion of Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, please be mindful of spoilers for those who want to tread into the Realm of Shadow with nothing but their determination and their minds unclouded.&nbsp;

Thank you for your cooperation.

<p>Despite this reasonable request, if you're worried about spoilers and don't plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you'll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if you don't care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/04/a-three-hour-trek-through-the-realm-of-shadow">hands-on preview</a> or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/ngt/2024/06/04/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-gameplay-today">New Gameplay Today</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of exactly the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.

I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It's an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Two's company, three's a crowd," the saying goes, unless the first two are warriors and the third one is a priest, in which case the superior proverb is surely "three's a moderately balanced squad, two's a massive liability"? Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which "only" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more "intimate", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

Galvanic Games, who released the sandbox survival game last year, said that ongoing sales of the game were not enough to keep the studio going, and they'd run out of time to find funding for a new project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’ve been a ton of Jackbox Party Packs over the last near-decade, each following a fairly similar structure: one or two standout games you’ll want to replay, a couple you might dip into every now and then, and at least one you’ll try once and then never bother with again. With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.

And, yes, nobody really knows why Bloodborne isn’t on PC yet, almost a decade after it released on PlayStation 4 - despite Sony’s apparent delight in bringing every other PlayStation exclusive to PC, just to mock us. It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

Our Adventurer Guild is cheerfully simple in appearance, and its turn-based fights and griddy missions establish its parts at once as familiar, potentially even by-the-numbers. But those parts are arranged into an original and deceptively detailed mercenary management game that got harder to put down the longer I played.

In amongst the press releases, indie nuggets, and the occasional pitch for sponsored AI content (no, never), something truly exquisite occasionally peeks through the chest lid. This week, it was a completely context-free message containing several photos of what appear to be artificial houseplants from a man named ‘Harold’. We take criticism seriously here, so I can only assume the sender intended the contents of these imposter pots to be judged as such. Well, I’m nothing if not obliging. Apologies for the quality of the images. I screen-grabbed then resized them up because I was too scared to download them in case they contained explosives or something.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.

      <p>Developer Arc System Works has revealed <em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers</em>, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there's no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy's "Find Your Way" music video in Guilty Gear Strive. </p>

<p>As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says <em>Dual Rulers</em> will be at this year's Anime Expo 2024 in July. </p>

<p>"Shigeru Morikawa (famous for <em>Argonavis the Movie: Axia</em>) will direct," the <em>Dual Rulers</em> <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/anime-adaptation-guilty-gear-strive-dual-rulers-announced/">announcement</a> reads. "Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for <em>Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist</em>) as associate producer."</p>

Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive People Make Games documentary.

The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past I've described Phantom Blade Zero, the foetid and frantic new action-RPG from Chinese studio S-Game, as a Soulslike, and more specifically a Sekirolike. I must now hang my head and await the executioner's ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero's ambience and layouts owe something to From's work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma. Getting rocket-speared in the bum was only the start of its worst day ever.

Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“When I was young,” the villager washing garments in the river says, “I thought it was enough to clean the dirty laundry once and be calm. Not that it will get dirty forever.” I’m not sure I’ve ever felt the crushing weight of universal entropic decay so keenly as in that RPG maker textbox, nested upon Felvidek’s nicotine-stain hues. I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it's not Silversun. Sit down, Brian. Let somebody else have a go at answering. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.

Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a little sheepish about how much I'm looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It's neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

      <p>Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of <em>Arcane</em>, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA" width="640"></iframe>

<p>Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While <em>Arcane</em> will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<em>Arcane</em> is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of <em>Arcane</em> wraps up with this second season. But <em>Arcane</em> is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”</p>

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

      <p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that "addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game," but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.</p>

<p>A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/11/marvels-spider-man-2-update-includes-suit-collab-and-fan-favorites-available-june-18/">which can be seen on PlayStation's blog</a>, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

I do not give a single solitary biscuit about that leperous avian, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste my new-found position of prominence on this glorious website by not moralising at you heartless rune-hoarders about the unconscionable violence you keep inflicting on my bulbous, shiny frog sons. With Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree out soon, the amount of violence the community is collectively inflicting is breaking my tiny heart.

Piracy Shield launched in February under new law that compels all 300+ of the country's ISPs to block pirate streaming services. It now transpires that Italy's blocking system was only designed to accommodate 70 ISPs and now times out under the strain. By end of 2024, Piracy Shield Phase 2 will make its debut.

In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment's open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

      <p>When your entire franchise revolves around sneaky assassins lurking in the shadows and running up buildings, it's no surprise fans of the series have been clamoring for a ninja-themed protagonist for years. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand lo…]]></summary>

      <p>Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time reemerged during Ubisoft's Forward event, but only slightly. Basically, Ubisoft confirmed the game is still in development, but it won't be releasing until 2026.</p>

<p>The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.</p>

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.

It’s from Strange Scaffold, of El Paso, Elsewhere and Booked For The Week fame. It is a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage that has you chaining together thrown knives and solar plexus punches, headshots and tree-fu. Lob an empty pistol at your screen, and then replace it, because you’ll need it to watch the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

It's not XCOM, but it is XCOM-ing soon. That's about as good a joke as I can muster on a Monday morning. Don't worry, there are funnier ones in the trailer below.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never played the original Perfect Dark, but the trailer for the reboot shown during this evening's Xbox Games Showcase instantly made it the most exciting game I've seen during not-E3. It's first-person, it's got stealth, it's got parkour, it's got hand-to-hand melee combat including slidekicks. It looks like a mashup of Mirror's Edge and something more immersive sim-y? What's not to like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Age Of Mythology: Retold, the remaster of the classic strategy beast-em-up, is due to release this year, 4th September 2024 on PC and Game Pass. This will be the 2002 game’s second remaster following its Extended Addition re-release in 2014, and aims to thoroughly spiff up the original with a 3D visual overhaul, new animations and texture, plus UI and QOL improvements. Prevent yourself being seduced by the suspiciously thunder-imbued swan that’s currently chatting you up, and have a gander at the trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake - aka Metal Gear Solid Delta - resurfaced during tonight’s Xbox Games Showcase. We still don’t have a release date, despite signs we might see the remake of the 2004 game this year, but we did get a pretty good look at a bunch of key moments from the original remade in the shiny Unreal Engine 5 do-over - including a look at The Boss and the familiar gravelly tones of Snake actor David Hayter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have published the very first trailer for EA and BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, formerly known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, at their summer Xbox Game Showcase. It accompanies the first details of this "immersive single player RPG" - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - "where you become the leader others believe in". Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've known for a while that Starfield was getting its first expansion later this year, but tonight's Xbox Games Showcase gave us its first trailer. My main takeaway? That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they're on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

It takes the FPS series back to a more civilised medieval age, where men and demon solved their disputes with throwable chainsaw shields, massive dragons, and guns that grind skulls at silly speeds then fire out the bone chips.

When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.
