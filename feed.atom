        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, the team behind the ghost hunting hit Phasmophobia whet appetites with talks of the Eventide update. Well, the patch should be rolling out as we speak, and because it's a pretty significant one this time around, there are quite a number of new things being implemented.


I'll go through some of the bigger changes, but suffice it to say that probably the biggest thing in the game is the Point Hope map. We don't often get treated to brand-new locations (the last couple were essentially rebrandings of ones that already exist), so this should at least make anyone who's not played for a while pay a bit of attention.




Sadly, there's still no word on when the console version of Phasmophobia is likely to drop. We know that Kinetic Games is still working on it, and there'll be some ne…]]></summary>

If this sounds familiar, Ratalaika and Shiyuden announced a digital version, Cyber Citizen Shockman Zero, not long ago. There was also a fan translation that reached completion last year. This release isn’t related to either of those, with Retro-Bit’s featuring their own bespoke translation.


The Retro-Bit version comes on a translucent orange cartridge (they call the color “Shock Orange”), packed in a hardcover case, and with an instruction manual.

When does Farming Simulator 25 come out?


Farming Simulator 25 will be released on Nov. 12, 2024. Although the game has yet to be released, a roadmap has already been implemented for those who purchase the Year 1 Bundle. The first quarter offers more 'Innovative Machinery,' while the following phase focuses on plains and prairies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Wuthering Waves 1.1: Thaw of Eons update just around the corner, Kuro Game Studio has released new information regarding when the game will go down for maintenance and what players will get ias compensation.


The 1.1: Thaw of Eons update brings plenty of new content to Wuthering Waves, including a whole new map to explore, new quests, new Resonators, and a whole lot more. If you’re wondering when the game will go down for maintenance, I’ve got you covered.


Maintenance is scheduled to take at the following times, depending on your time zone:


Time Zone
Maintenance period


PST
3 p.m. on June 27 until 10 p.m. on June 27


EST
6 p.m. on June 27 until 1 a.m. on June 28


GMT
11 p.m. on June 27 until 6 a.m. on June 28






Rather than just receiving an update and that being enough, Wuthering Waves players will be getting yet another compensatory reward of in-game items, which will be delivered to all players as long as they have an account and have unlocked the mail service prior to the beginning of maintenance. 


For the inconvenience of receiving this free update, players will get:



300 Astrite


2 Crystal Solvent



If, for any reason, maintenance extends beyond the times mentioned above, the compensatory rewards will be adjusted. These rewards will be sent out within six hours of the patch going live, and players will have 30 days in which to claim them.

The remastered collection of the first three games was admittedly welcome, as was the addition to Tomb Raider Legend on PlayStation Plus. And now Lara Croft is set to appear as the newest crossover character in Dead by Daylight.


This news had leaked beforehand, but developer Behaviour Interactive has since formally confirmed Lara's inclusion on its website. Unsurprisingly, her appearance is based on how she looked in the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot. Given how the modern games have offered a more grounded take on Lara, with her forced to survive in harsh environments, this depiction of the character is certainly a better fit for Dead by Daylight than her original 90's action hero persona.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've almost arrived at one of the biggest PC events of the year. Every summer, we get to experience our video game libraries growing as our personal funds become depleted. The below trailer shows that the Steam Summer Sale 2024 will be kicking off later on this week.


Thursday, June 27, to be precise, and ending on July 11 at 10 a.m. PDT. Like all the other Steam sale videos, we get a quick tease on what we can expect over the course of those two weeks, as title after title gets given a price slash, right when we should really be outdoors enjoying the sun. Oh well.




We don't know every game that's in the sale, but it looks like big names such as Palworld, Content Warning, Stellaris, Batman: Arkham Knight, and Manor Lords will be featured. Plus, the announcer says something about a new category called "deep discounts." Whatever that means.


Full Steam ahead


In a way, the Steam Summer Sale has already begun. If you head on over to the Steam Deck page, you can see Valve's handheld device is currently 15% off, a deal that's ongoing until the main sale ends. The discount is only on the 64GB and 512GB systems, and doesn't include the OLED models.


I remember when I got a custom gaming PC for the first time in years, a long while back. It gave me the impetus to get involved with the big summer sale event. Ooh, the games I bought (spoiler: many).


In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion that some of the ones I purchased are still sat in my To-Play list, having never been installed on any of my systems. That's the price you pay for being a PC gamer, I guess. We all know that feeling, yeah?

While there are no story details about season 2, it sounds like it will fittingly be adapting the Alabaster Saga (the manga/anime's second major story arc) since it will feature members of that saga's main antagonists: a criminal syndicate called Baroque Works. The syndicate is comprised of a lot of characters, but Variety has shared casting details on four of its higher-ranking members, who long-time fans of One Piece should be plenty familiar with.

It's not hard to see why, as it scales great with Strength and Arcane, reasonably well with Dexterity, and it is a solid option for both Bleed and Arcane builds.

The Bloodfiend's Arm can drop from Bloodfiends, large, hulking enemies that can be found in a few areas of the map. The best location to get the Bloodfiend's Arm is a small area called Prospect Town, to the south of Belurat Tower.

To get beyond the keep to the Scaduview region, players will need to travel through back roads, a flooded district, and take many lifts. While this region is optional, it's required for the Count Ymir questline. Whether you're completing the questline or want to see the entirety of what Shadow of the Erdtree has to offer, here's how to get to Scaduview.

Earlier today, though, publisher THQ not only confirmed an exact release date of September 24 for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, but also a few neat looking DLC costumes.


The original Epic Mickey never had alternate outfits, so these costumes are entirely new for the remake. What's more, each one is based on a classic Mickey Mouse short. You obviously have the iconic Steamboat Willie outfit from Mickey's debut short as well as the Brave Little Tailor outfit from the 1938 short of the same name. I don't recognize the third one, which is only called the Football outfit, but I'm assuming it comes from 1932's Touchdown Mickey since it feature…]]></summary>

Looking back over our 2013 review of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon on the 3DS has been a timely reminder of why we love this game so very much, yet have failed to return to it beyond our original playthrough back in the day - an oddity, given that we're quite partial to hoovering up every last secret there is to find in most games we enjoy.
It was the controls, you see. They were fiddly in the first Luigi's Mansion, and in the second game the lack of an extra thumbstick on the 3DS made for an experience that felt marred slightly by the shortcomings of the system on which it was delivered. It wasn't a huge deal — this writer is still very much in agreement with the 9/10 score dished out by this site at the time — it was always just one of those things with this series. A great idea, smart games, excellent puzzles and tons of atmosphere, all held back a little bit. A franchise that felt like it needed unleashing onto a new platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who has always preferred Luigi to his inferior sibling, Luigi’s Mansion was a priority purchase when the GameCube launched back in 2001. I still have a lot of affection for it, as one should.


By the time Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon rolled around in 2013, I had given up hope that we’d ever see a sequel. I was extremely excited at its announcement, and even more so when I learned that Next Level Games, fresh from their work on the excellent Punch-Out and Super Mario Strikers Charged games on Wii, were handling its development.


And since I’m not fond of playing on a handheld, since I haven’t left my house in the time since the release of Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon, I was happy to see it was getting ported to Switch. As it turns out, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is a great way to experie…]]></summary>

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi's sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The co-operative clambering of Chained Together is easy to understand. It's like Fall Guys in the fiery pits of hell, with a tower of fiendish platforming challenges. It brings to mind the mind-shattering failures of Getting Over It and a previous short-lived clamber sim called Only Up. Also, you are chained to your teammates. Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game's background is performing with his idle hands. But none of this means they can't work together to escape the inferno. Right?

On Friday, June 21, former Twitch account director of strategic partnerships Cody Conners said on Twitter, "He [referring to Beahm] got banned because he was caught sexting a minor in the then-existing Twitch Whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang." Conner replied to his own post on X (formerly Twitter) and said, "No one made the wrong decision, f*** him and his boys."

However, it did bring some new bugs with it. Some of them were resolved with another patch, but others have remained, even after today's patch, which has at least fixed the FAF-14 Spear.


For context, the FAF-14 Spear Stratagem was in need of improvements, but wound up not working properly after the June 13 patch. It was fixed in the June 18 patch, only for the Spear to sometimes crash the game while aiming (is this thing cursed or something?). According to the patch notes for Patch 01.000.403, this should no longer be an issue, but I wouldn't blame players for still being wary about using it.

The game will be released later this year on November 12, 2024, and it's coming to PC, Mac, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.


Farming Simulator 25 is a huge step up from the last mainline entry in the franchise, Farming Simulator 22, and a world away from the mobile and Nintendo Switch entry Farming Simulator 23. It boasts, for the first time in series history, Asian farming, over 400 machines to buy, ride in, and master, new crops, and even extra animals. The main focus of this entry's cinematic trailer is, as you might expect, Asian farming techniques and crops, which are a huge change of pace from European and US farming.

It's not instantly clear how to do this though, so I've put together this guide to walk you through it. 


The streets of Los Santos are filled with thieves and criminals, and if you want to make some extra cash while rounding up these crooks, you'll need to work with Maude and open a bounty hunter business. Thankfully, the steps to do it aren't too difficult, but you'll need some cash to make it happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Dawntrail expansion for Final Fantasy XIV is going to be a big one for fans. After all, it's the first major expansion for the game since Endwalker, and that came out nearly three years ago in December 2021. With Dawntrail round the corner, though, you will need to put Final Fantasy XIV down for a bit since it's going offline for maintenance this week.


According to a blog post from Square Enix, maintenance is scheduled to begin on Wednesday, June 26 at around 4 a.m. PDT / 7 a.m. EDT / 12 p.m. BST for the console versions, and on Thursday, June 27 at around 8 a.m. PDT / 11 a.m. EDT / 4 p.m. BST for the PC versions. As such, Final Fantasy 14 will be completely unplayable. Ideally, this'll only last until Friday, June 28 at 2 a.m. PDT / 5 a.m. EDT / 10 a.m. BST, but that's still subject to change.

As a reminder, there will be an early access period for Dawntrail as well as a couple of further patches that will add new content. Be sure to check our maintenance schedule for when these will arrive and what will be included in the patches. Otherwise, if you have any unfinished business in Final Fantasy XIV, you'd better get it out of the way now before it goes offline. We also have some suggestions for what you can do to best prepare for Dawntrail, such as de-cluttering your inventory and leveling up an alt Job.


There is a lot to look forward to when Dawntrail launches on July 2. Aside from a new continent to explore, there will be two new Job classes (including the already popular Pictomancer), a new playable race, and Final Fantasy XIV's first major graphics overhaul in over 10 years.

In this article, I'll talk about my preferred boss order, but it will be filled with spoilers, so keep that in mind. 


Best Boss Order for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree


This list will be of the major bosses rather than every single boss in the game. There are over 70 major and minor bosses all over the game, so it will take me some time to come up with a list that covers them all and at least one more playthrough of the DLC before I have my mind made up on a complete boss order.

Developer Game Freak has been known to dabble in projects outside of the Pokémon franchise, producing the likes of the excellent Pocket Card Jockey and Little Town Hero, and now it's just launched a new mobile game called Pand Land (thanks, Siliconera). If you remember, the company filed trademarks for the title at the start of the year, but we weren't too sure what it was all about at the time.
Although there's no word on a worldside release at the time of writing, Pand Land is available via Android and iOS in Japan. Described as a casual marine adventure RPG, you travel the lands with your crew to collect various bits of treasure. Boasting some rather charming voxel-based visuals, you'll also explore dangerous dungeons and can tackle the game either on your own or with friends.

If you're a staunch fan of the 3DS, then chances are you've dabbled in the Streetpass and Spotpass features over the years. The latter, of course, is no longer available since Nintendo shut down the online servers, but if you're out and about with your 3DS, then you can still benefit from the StreetPass function (that is, if you find anyone else with their own console).
One of the games that made use of the StreetPass function was Puzzle Swap, which allowed you to slowly reveal images via new tiles. Some of these were exclusive images offered via the Spotpass feature, and a group of fans is currently on the hunt for one last image.

I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for strategy game Total War Warhammer 3 that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Summer Sale is kicking off this week, say Valve, purveyors of fine games and thousands of crap ones too (don't worry, we help you tell the difference). The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That's a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat 'em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don't know any other objects associated with this mythological "summer" people talk about, I'm from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that'll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair CEO Takuri Mizobe has poured cold water on the idea of a Nintendo Switch port of Palworld, just days after the company teased the development of a PlayStation version. 


In an interview with Game File, Mizobe didn't totally rule out the idea of it coming to the console, but stated that doing so could be difficult due to the technology differences between PCs and current-gen consoles compared to the Nintendo Switch, which is now seven years old. 


He explained that the graphical and technical demands on Palworld on PC are higher than what the Switch can produce, saying: "Maybe it's hard to port to Switch just for technical reasons."

Of course, the highly anticipated successor to the Nintendo Switch may be able to manage the demands of Palworld, but it could be March 2025 before we even get an announcement about the new system, and there's no real timeline for its release. 


It looks like Nintendo will be the only one of the "big three" console makers to miss out on Palworld, at least for the foreseeable future following the teasing of a PlayStation port by the game's community manager on June 22. 


It would definitely be interesting to see Palworld on Nintendo systems though, especially when you consider the fact that the game has been labeled "Pokemon with guns." The creatures are reminiscent of characters from the Pokemon world, and Nintendo is notoriously strict about how things related to their IP are handled. 


While Palworld on Nintendo Switch may not be happening right now, there's still plenty for fans of the game to look forward to thanks to the Sakurajima update which drops on June 27, bringing a new island, new Pals, another raid, and a higher level cap.

Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.

It's only obtainable after you unclog the area's Spirit Spring, shortly after the section of Scarlet Rot and red Pest enemies. Once you've got the Spirit Spring flowing, make your way to the following location on the map to find an invisible bridge. Cross it, and take the sword from the altar.

Next, head to Unte Ruins


If you haven't found or unlocked the Unte Ruins, don't fret. We have a handy guide for both finding and unlocking them. Basically, you'll just be taking a somewhat hidden ladder in Shadow Keep, then heading through an illusory wall to get to the ruins. Then it's just a quick toss of a Hefty Furnace Pot into the slumbering Golem's head to make your way inside.

Once you've gained access to the ruins, you'll be able to place the Stone-Sheathed Sword in the alter (much like the one you pulled it from) to transform it into the Sword of Light.

The Weapon Art, simply called Light, boosts Holy Damage for about a minute on activation. This buff also applies after the sword has been sheathed, so keeping it handy in an offhand slot could be useful for maximizing the damage of your Incantations.

The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …]]></summary>

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumble bumbled.
The Super Monkey Ball franchise has experienced its fair share of peaks and troughs over the years. The first two GameCube titles knocked it out of the park, providing a plethora of content from the addictive maze-like main stages to the incredible minigames. Since then, however, the series has seemingly been unable to reach the same heights, either content to take one step forward and two steps back, or otherwise completely fumbling the (monkey) ball altogether.
After Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania instilled a smidgen of confidence with its commendable restoration of Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2, Sega is back with a brand-new entry in the form of Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. However, in keeping with franchise tradition, it’s yet another game that just can’t quite hit the home run, combining a solid single-player experience with a bunch of multiplayer modes that, frankly, aren’t worth the price of admission or the time investment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2019 after various speculation-based CPU vulnerabilities began coming to light, Amazon engineers proposed process-local memory allocations for hiding KVM secrets. They were striving for an alternative mitigation for vulnerabilities like L1TF by essentially providing some memory regions for kernel allocations out of view/access from other kernel code. Amazon engineers this week laid out a new proposal after five years of ongoing Linux kernel improvements for MM-local memory allocations for dealing with current and future speculation-based cross-process attacks...]]></summary>

Nintendo has shared some key details about the new top-down Zelda game (starring the Princess herself), but there's still a lot of information that hasn't been revealed just yet. Fortunately, one small detail we've now got is the game's file size - revealing just how much space you'll need on your Switch if you're planning on picking up the eShop version.
According to official listings for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, you'll need around 6GB of free space. Grezzo's 2019 Switch release The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening requires close to the same amount of space. While the new top-down entry is reasonably sized by Switch standards, fortunately, it doesn't match the latest open-world release Tears of the Kingdom.

Hello everyone, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get cracking with this week's battle, let's see how things panned out last time. We looked at Turok 2: Seeds of Evil for the N64 and golly gosh, was it a close one.

Nintendo this week announced a brand new Mario & Luigi RPG, officially titled Mario & Luigi: Brothership. Like a lot of the company's new releases nowadays, it wasn't ready to reveal the team behind this Switch project, but we've now got a small update on this.
Game File's Stephen Totilo asked a Nintendo rep who the developer of Brothership is now that AlphaDream is out of action, and although they wouldn't reveal this information, apparently "some of the original developers who worked on the franchise are involved".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five men accused of operating one of the largest pirate IPTV services in the United States, have been convicted by a Las Vegas federal jury. Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber, generated millions of dollars in revenue through Jetflicks, a subscription service that reportedly offered more content than Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime. Four of the men face up to five years in prison; Dallmann's maximum is 48 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game," the announcement reads. "By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware." 
Though Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to "Settings" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select "Preview." This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series.

Nivalis (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed. If, like me, you're intrigued by the promise of a life under a neon canopy, you might have to wait. The release date has been pushed into next year. As compensation, here, the creators have put out another trailer to remind you what's coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an "Innapropriate activity detected" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.
Elden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It's here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:

Avowed was featured as a major part of Xbox's Summer presentations.

We caught up with Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo to find out even more about Avowed, covering what they think of comparisons to Skyrim, how they feel about Baldur's Gate 3, why romance was considered for the game but ultimately not included, and why playing The Outer Worlds may gave you the best idea of what to expect from Avowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece," Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. "Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive." 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by "Project Phoenix", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a "visual prototype" for a brand new Red Faction game.

Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the 'default' option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

Roguelikes won't guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They're more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat's hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it's a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The Republic Of Pirates was meant to be different…” laments the narration in the opening of the seafaring resource-chain-em-up strategy, out today with a demo on Steam at time of writing. This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game's protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.
Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. "It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece," he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might have noticed that the second most played game on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It's a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there," Iizuka says. "Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They're very popular and dynamic characters."

Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character.

The otherwise fantastic cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a barrage of technical problems at launch, as the MMO’s servers buckled under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tales Of The Shire unfolds in a world without shadow. There are shadows, technically, but they’re so mellow and fuzzy they might as well be stray pools of sunlight that have forgotten to glow. In this latest chunk of Lord Of The Rings memorabilia from developers Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division, you are a custom-created hobbit who has just taken up residence in the charming Tellytubby town of Bywater, there to spend your days foraging, fishing, feasting and fraternizing with your fellow halfings, all of whom wear expressions of rosy-cheeked humour so intense in their winsome affability that your own face soon forms a merry rictus in response - like that terrible smile from Disco Elysium, but cosy. Oh god, no. Oh god, get it off me.

I bought my first laptop for uni, barely suitable for much except typing long literature essays in which I’d complete assignments using my favorite university trick of writing “ah, but to answer this question, we must first explore (whatever I actually wanted to write an essay about.)” Faltering, bricky turnip that it was, I still had some of my favourite gaming memories on that thing, mainly around aging RPGs: Baldur’s Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, and the old Fallouts.

A warrant was executed at a flat in Nottingham where a 42-year-old was detained on suspicion of offenses related to the provision of pirated Sky broadcasts. For deterrent purposes, both the police and Sky want reports like this to reach the public, and that is being achieved. The response, however, is one of almost universal criticism, on grounds that in many cases have little or nothing to do with piracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I wrote our Still Wakes The Deep review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. "Gobshite" became "bastard". The "polis" were localised as the "police". And every "yersel" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became "yourself". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to "International English" for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There's another option, says one of the game's developers.

And it's by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there's one thing that really gets me going, it's a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form.

It's a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don't talk about their sacrifices enough. It's out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020's Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I've got a trailer's worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …]]></summary>

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Aces is billed as “a vision of the future for real-time strategy” but if you glance at a screen, you might think you’re staring into the past: another toonified science fiction world of scuffed, shiny nodules, lanes and arenas, an overly functional colour scheme, and hotkeyed hordes of little and large units that appear devoid of personality, even by top-down generalissimo standards. Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. "Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too," notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. "So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.]]></summary>

Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts. It is… a lot. It's too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new "hand-drawn character visuals" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.]]></summary>

Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.

While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today's announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994's X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-'em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.]]></summary>

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create "echoes" of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…]]></summary>

The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth's greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.
Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.]]></summary>

This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a "seafaring adventure" that will include new evolved "Bros moves".


The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, "It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it".
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.]]></summary>

Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn't that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there's a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.

"Habbo Hotel is back!" is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.]]></summary>

For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion's content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you're worried about spoilers and don't plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you'll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

Monster Hunter is known for its protagonists overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds in their pursuit of taking down the massive monsters that populate the region, but with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom may be taking it to a whole new level. While at Summer Game Fest Play Days, I took in an extended gameplay demo involving an Alpha Monster hunt. I left the demo excited to dive into this seemingly improved take on what the very popular Monster Hunter World delivered in 2018.
Monster Hunter World served as Capcom's big push into making a more mainstream and globally appealing entry in the franchise. The team work…]]></summary>

Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of exactly the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.

I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It's an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer has shut down Pieces Interactive, the developer of the Alone in the Dark reimagining that arrived earlier this year. The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. 
Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.]]></summary>

The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.
Join us for a #NintendoDirect livestream focused on #NintendoSwitch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.

June 17, 2024
With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company's fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it's likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. 
With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-17T14:05:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.
The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. 


Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). 
Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. 
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which "only" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more "intimate", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game that closely follows the events of Wu Cheng’en’s seminal novel Journey to the West. The work, based on Chinese mythology and Buddhist folklore, follows a monk who meets a spirit called Sun Wukong, often called Monkey King, during his search for sacred religious texts. While its central narrative is still unknown, Game Science’s upcoming Soulslike depicts Wukong’s encounters with Yaoguai, various creatures and demons in Chinese myth, set within stunning Eastern landscapes…]]></summary>

Books obviously come in many different sizes, but did you know that there’s an obscure law that dictates the legal limit for how long a novel can be? It’s measured in ‘George Martins’. If your story is more than three ‘Georges’ wide, you’re swiftly escorted to a cell and made to eat any bits of book that reference more than three characters in a scene with the same surname. This week, it's developer and writer of the legendarily good Radiator Blog, Robert Yang! Cheers Robert! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, everyone wants to play Bloodborne on PC. It’s one of those universally accepted truths, like gravity or pizza being delicious. And, yes, nobody really knows why Bloodborne isn’t on PC yet, almost a decade after it released on PlayStation 4 - despite Sony’s apparent delight in bringing every other PlayStation exclusive to PC, just to mock us. It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often in the ignoble craft of james gournalism you stumble on a game that reminds you why you got into this weird and silly trade, a game that slices through the phantasmagorical mulch of a million Summer Game Fest announcements and clears the portals of the brain. It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there's no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy's "Find Your Way" music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year's Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
"Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct," the Dual Rulers announcement reads. "Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer."
Here's a look at Dual Rulers' key art:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as Kingdom Hearts has come to Steam. The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.

It's set in a 1920s boarding school, where you can expect "tuition in Latin, Geometry and a wide range of team sports, all within the beautiful setting of our isolated country estate".

While downtime is quite common for pirate sites, a mysterious statement by the team is open for interpretation, leading some to believe that it will not return anytime soon. Since the site is a prominent source of new movie and TV show releases, this is a big deal.

Instead, players can use a developer- and user-created asset library to build and "remix" game worlds, then publish them for other folks to play. 

Those creative tools will be available to some people next week, when the closed Builders Beta launches on June 18th.

I must now hang my head and await the executioner's ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero's ambience and layouts owe something to From's work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.

Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.
