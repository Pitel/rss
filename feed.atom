        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Space originally came out in 2008. It was re-released to great fanfare earlier this year, its visuals updated for modern hardware. You might think that’s more than enough Dead Space for now, thank you very much, but we don’t always have to go so HD with these remakes. Sometimes we can go back.

Nintendo and Illumination's Mario Movie is absolutely dominating at the box office, but it's not the only success. The Mario Movie song 'Peaches' performed by Jack Black as Bowser has also been charting. Not long after the real-life version of the song was released it made it into the top 100 on iTunes.
Now, according to Universal, Peaches is eligible to submit for 'best original song' consideration at The Academy Awards (aka. the Oscars).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2012, Double Fine Productions launched a Kickstarter campaign to make an adventure game.
At the time, the idea was that the adventure genre was dead – at least in the eyes of major publishers. However, as Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, who made his name working on point-and-click adventure games for LucasArts, seemed to think, there was still a sizable enough audience out there that someone should make a new one. Why not Double Fine? And why not go directly to the source – the fans – for the game's funding?
In Double Fine's pitch, it theorized the then-unnamed project as a smaller game. The company asked for $400,000 from fans – specifically $300,000 to make the game and $100,000 to allow documentary crew 2 Player Productions to film the development. On that last point, Double Fine wo…]]></summary>

Ravenswatch was really not on my radar prior to this weekend. I'd heard some rumblings here and there, but after a few friends talked me into it and I saw the fairly cheap price tag, I figured I'd give it a shot. Co-op roguelite with some vague whiffs of dungeon-crawling sounded like a good time.
And it is, as it turns out, a good time. Passtech Games, the studio you might best know for its work on Curse of the Dead Gods, has something here with Ravenswatch. It's visually appealing, clever and evolving, with some good variety run-over-run. My only hang-up is that there isn't a lot here right now, either.

So, I was facing off against “The Stiff” which I’m sure is already a nickname, but there’s no way his friends don’t call him “Stiffy” behind his back. It starts off with this big dude and Kyle Travers pointing guns at each other in a cutscene. The fight starts and I unload said pistol at the guy, and it does basically nothing. His health bar is cut down by an amount that would be offensive to the whole clip of bullets I put into him. So I ditch it and beat him up with fists.
As I’m fighting him, guns just keep dropping out. He’d fall down, drop his pistol, get back up, reach behind himself, and reveal a new pistol. I can only imagine Stiffy was wearing an absolute tangle of holsters on his back. Or maybe he just has a gunsmith up his ass. He finally takes enou…]]></summary>

Half-Life: Alys is, by many accounts, a fantastic experience for virtual reality headset owners. But for those who haven't had the chance yet or don't have the means, there is also a mod that has now made Half-Life: Alyx playable from start to end, without VR.
The GB_2 Development Team has been steadily working on Half-Life: Alyx NoVR, a project with a simple goal: make Alyx playable without virtual reality. No need to install new drivers or anything like that; just drag, drop, and hit Play.
In an update published on April 9, the NoVR mod team confirms Half-Life: Alyx is now playable from start to finish, without a headset. Additionally, the Gravity Gloves and Combine fabricators are operational. The team also has an FAQ set up, with any additional info or details you could want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTLotwKpLgk
Currently 33 of the 42 achievements on Steam are also earnable using NoVR. The other nine can't be earned at the moment due to workarounds and issues with triggers, though the crew is working to get these running in the future.
More updates are on the way, and other Half-Life: Alyx mods are even somewhat compatible with NoVR. It's pretty impressive.
Seeing the world a different way
You might wonder why, with Half-Life: Alyx standing as one of the titans of virtual reality, you'd want to play it without the tech it's emphasizing. Well, as the GB_2 team points out, there's a multitude of reasons. Maybe you have health concerns, like easily getting motion sick. Or maybe it's an accessibiliy issue. Heck, maybe you just don't want to play it in VR, or want to experience it outside of VR after having done so in VR.
It's your choice, and though I think I'll want my own Alyx playthrough to be in VR when it comes up on the backlog docket, I appreciate how much work has been put into this alternative option. You can find the mod and keep up with its updates here.

Have you wanted to play Dead Space, but both the 2023 remake and the 2008 original are just not quite old enough for you? You’re in luck, because now you can play Dead Space reimagined as if it was running on the PS1 via a short Dead Space Demake demo developed by Fraser Brumley.
The tech demo is only 10-15 minutes long, and it seems unlikely it will ever get any more extensive than that. I gave it a try, and it… sure is Dead Space as depicted through chunky polygons and unfiltered textures.
"I've been working on this for a lot longer than I planned and the end product is probably shorter than you expect but I hope you have fun playing it," Brumley said on the demake's Itch page. "This project was mostly a way for me to learn Unreal and the PS1 aesthetic so look forward to what I'll be putting together in the future."
[caption id="attachment_373107" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
It’s kind of hard to say this is what the actual Dead Space would be like on the PlayStation 1. It still utilizes the over-the-shoulder camera angle that wasn’t really popular until 2005’s Resident Evil 4. It presents some dialogue through a heavily compressed cutscene, and I did find it amusing that Dead Space Demake keeps pestering you to “shoot off their limbs” multiple times, even after your first necromorph encounter.
Rather than an earnest attempt to fit a modern game on older hardware, Dead Space Demake feels more like a light-hearted homage. Sort of a fond love letter to both Dead Space and the PS1 hardware. In that sense, it succeeds. Just don't expect anything in the way of fun technical magic.
You can download the Dead Space Demake right now from itch.io.

Nintendo of America has filed an application for a DMCA subpoena at a district court in California which, if granted, would order Discord to reveal the identity of the person who leaked The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's art book back in February.
TorrentFreak reported earlier today that the company's attorneys applied for the DMCA subpoena on 7th April 2023, and it specifically mentions the name of the user who Nintendo believes is responsible for the leak, along with the name of the Discord server where the images reportedly leaked first. As laid out under US copyright law in Section 512(h), a DMCA subpoena requires that a provider — for example, a sales website or a social media platform — must disclose the details of the infringer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No indication's been given on what's next for the former Halo head
Former Halo Infinite head of creative Joseph Staten is leaving Microsoft. The Halo series veteran is headed for a new adventure, both he and the company have confirmed.
The news broke via IGN, which reported that the former head of creative would be leaving Microsoft. A Microsoft spokesperson told IGN: "We’re grateful for Joseph’s contributions to the Halo franchise and Xbox as a whole. We wish him all the best in his new adventure."
Staten took to social media to comment on the report. "Hey folks, I am indeed leaving Microsoft," Staten writes. "I'll have more info to share soon, but for now, I'd just like to thank all my [Xbox] colleagues for all their understanding and support as I embark on a new adventure."
https://twitter.com/joestaten/status/1644501906126176257
Staten has worked on a considerable chunk of the Halo series. He worked as cinematic director for the first three Halo games, and also worked as lead writer for Destiny at Bungie.
He eventually returned to Microsoft as a senior creative director, eventually taking on a role with 343 Industries. Reports indicated that he had returned to the Xbox publishing side earlier this year, around the same time as major layoffs happened at Microsoft.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say Halo
Staten's departure is a notable one for Microsoft, especially following other reports around 343 Industries. The future of the franchise can hopefully start to look up at some point, but right now, Halo's in a weird spot.
The rest of Xbox, meanwhile, is gearing up for the summer. A dual showcase, spotlighting both Xbox Games Studios and a Direct specifically for Starfield, is scheduled for June 11. It will be interesting to see what Xbox has planned for the months ahead.

Picture the scene: the year is 2008 and you, a massive Nintendo fan, are gearing up for the next instalment in the Mario Kart series after the incredible online experience of Mario Kart DS and having poured many, many hours into the former home console endeavours on Mario Kart: Double Dash!! But something is different this time. Instead of playing the game with the conventional analogue stick and button inputs, you whack your Wii Remote into a white plastic wheel and swerve around the track by actually steering.
Mario Kart Wii turns 15 today and, for many of us, these controls are still looked back on fondly. Playing Mario Kart with motion controls felt like groundbreaking stuff back in 2008. No longer were we simply playing a driving game, we were actually driving. Collectively, we gripped the wheel at ten and two, leant into corners while sitting in our armchairs, and made every jump count by swiftly lifting the controller in the air in mimicry of the on-screen takeoff. It was brilliant.

Society has a habit of treating the most important laborers in the worst ways. Retail workers have it tough since, unlike a profession like utility worker, it’s an unskilled job and difficult to unionize. They’re treated as disposable. It’s not a “career.” You don’t need an education for it. So if you fall to the bottom of society, you’re lucky to wind up there. Customers rarely appreciate your work, but you need to fill the role of laborer, marketer, and janitor. Some don’t mind the work, and others might even enjoy it, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be respected like everyone else.

Naughty Dog has released another patch for the maligned PC port of its gloomy, over-the-shoulder remake The Last of Us Part I — Update 1.0.2.0, which is now live on the Steam platform, contains over 40 different fixes pertaining to visuals, gameplay, and performance.
Among the items fixed in the new update are numerous random crashes, the removal of an issue that was making analog sticks unresponsive, the correction of false information in the Graphics Quality menus, problems with flickering light and shadows in-game, and the removal of a bizarre bug that would render Joel, Ellie, and friends as dripping wet, as if they had all just come in out of a rainstorm. These are just a handful of the fixes promised by the new update, and you can check out the full patch notes right here.
The Last of Us Part I, a ground-up remake of Naughty Dog's 2012 adventure, released to critical praise on the PS5 platform back in September of last year. The PC port launched just a fortnight ago on March 28, but immediately disappointed fans with its resource-hungry specifications, myriad visual glitches, and an array of technical and performance-related problems. The developer has previously stated that it is prioritizing the fixing of these problems before it considers any form of additional content. A previous patch was released just last week, with more fixes expected in the near future.
The Last of Us Part I is available now on PS5 and PC.

Update: Annnnd just like that, the scrolls are sold out. As we stated below, Walmart has said that the bonus would only be available while stocks last, so we guess that's it for this one. Hey, it was nice for the few minutes that it lasted...

Original article: We are drawing ever closer to the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on 12th May, and the pre-order bonuses are in full swing. Over in North America, Walmart is the latest to get in on the reveals, as we have today learnt that those ordering from the store will receive a free limited edition gold-coloured wall scroll with the gnarly Master Sword on it (thanks, Nintendo Everything).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cal's journey kicks off soon
Over the weekend, Electronic Arts premiered what it says is the final gameplay trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ahead of its launch later this month. It sees Cal doing some great lightsaber swinging and Force slinging, but also the hero returning to Coruscant after all these years.
Coruscant, once home to the Jedi temple, has since been converted into an Imperial stronghold. Cal's return to this place, where he saw the Jedi get wiped out first-hand, seems like it could be an emotional moment.

We don't just see it, either. It looks like we'll have some work to do on Coruscant, though it's not quite as open-ended as some have speculated. EA clarified over the weekend that Coruscant is not a "freely explorable open world," only that it's one of the destinations in-game.
With that said, this new footage looks pretty rad. There's a moment in this trailer I love, where Cal is tussling with a Stormtrooper on hoverbikes. He shoves him off, and then Force-lifts him up into the air, right into an oncoming TIE Fighter's windshield. Fantastic. All of this, from the clever Force use to the tiny detail of Cal clicking off his lightsaber blade in the struggle, makes Star Wars Jedi: Survivor look pretty interesting to me.
I'm a survivor
It feels like we haven't seen too much of Respawn's follow-up to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but that's also a pretty good thing. I'm curious to see how old friends work back into the story alongside these new faces, as well as Cal's new goals in finding a safe home for the Jedi. Also, considering how many Jedi are running around nowadays, you'd think he'd run into a few others on his travels.
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on April 28.

Katsuhiro Harada, the long-time producer of Bandai Namco's Tekken, took to Twitter this weekend to answer fan questions regarding the attractive-looking sequel, Tekken 8 — As part of the impromptu back-and-forth, Harada essentially confirmed that the scrapper would feature both rollback netcode, as well as crossplay support, a first for the popular fight franchise.
According to Harada, crossplay between platforms is something that the producer has already pushed for in the past, but various issues between platform publishers had kept this from becoming a reality. It seems, however, that Tekken 8 will indeed allow players on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X to battle it out against each other, which is always a huge boon for any fighting game community.
https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1644917275621990401?s=20
Elsewhere in the online conversation, Harada said that Tekken 8 would feature rollback netcode, though it should be noted that current release Tekken 7 also features said technology, but struggles in an online capacity. One would hope that the sequel will see the online elements overhauled for stronger and smoother response. Harada also suggests that Tekken 8 might have a larger launch roster than "Capcom-sama", hinting that the new sequel will surpass Street Fighter 6's count of 18 World Warriors. When asked about a possible beta, the producer noted that the title was still in its alpha testing phase.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, Asuka Kazama, and Leroy Smith.

Konami has announced that Super Bomberman R 2 is slated for physical release on September 12, followed by it hitting digital storefronts on September 13. I have absolutely no idea why they’re doing it this way, but that’s what it says.
I feel like Super Bomberman R 2 was announced about a zillion years ago, but it turns out it was just last year. Maybe I’m getting it mixed up with all the ports and rejiggering of the original Super Bomberman R that originally dropped on Switch in 2017.

Illumination release The Super Mario Bros Movie has smashed box office records in its opening weekend, with a recorded $377 million global box office affording the Nintendo adaptation the mantle of biggest-ever opening for an animated movie.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which opened in American theaters on Wednesday, April 5, has seen sensational early success, with opening numbers surpassing those of the previous record holder, Walt Disney's 2019 sequel Frozen 2. The film, which sees Chris Pratt take up the role of the iconic Nintendo mascot, is being touted by analysts to become the highest-grossing movie of 2023, a feat that the animated movie looks set to achieve with ease, despite receiving mediocre reviews from many outlets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNcTBXTk4I&ab_channel=Illumination
While trailers have shown much promise in regards to the big-screen version of the Mushroom Kingdom and its denizens, some critics have lambasted the film for being all sizzle and no steak, complaining of wafer-thin storytelling, egregious use of cliched music, breathless pacing, and world-building that relies purely on reference recognition. Clearly, these comments have — and will — not divert the attention of the movie-going public, with the Mario Bros Movie set to dominate the spring box office and deliver further on the streaming and home release market for the remainder of the year.
Hope you like video game adaptations. We're about to get a decade of them. Shuffle over, Marvel.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now showing in North America, Europe, and China. It will premiere in Japan on April 27.

And that popularity can only grow as the millennials who have been with the brand since the early days of little gray boxes are starting to have families of their own, introducing their kids to the plumbers, the princesses, and the piranha plants that have defined their lives.

Whoa, these Pokemon Scarlet & Violet 7-star Tera Raids are flying by! It feels like we just had the second round of Decidueye, but now Typhlosion is making an appearance starting on April 14. At this point, Game Freak is going to add a good portion of the returning DLC roster to the Scarlet and Violet through events. Let's dig into the nitty gritty of this particular event.
When does the Typhlosion raid start?
According to the official news post from The Pokemon Company, these are the times and dates for the Typhlosion raid:
April 14 at 9AM JST through April 17 at 8:59 JST
April 21 at 9AM JST through April 24 at 8:59 JST
As usual, you'll have two chances to catch it over two weekends, just in case you're on vacation and forgot your Switch or something. It'll be a ghost Tera Type (plan accordingly), and like other prior Mightiest Mark 7-star raids, you can only catch one per save file. However, you can square off against it an unlimited amount of times while it's up to farm 7-star raid goodies. You'll also have the ability to breed the Typhlosion into a Cyndaquil.
Once Typhlosion arrives, we'll have plenty of info and guides to explain how to take it down the fastest; or in many cases, solo it offline!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Troublesome anti-tamper software leaves town
Capcom has quietly removed the controversial Denuvo DRM software from the PC edition of its acclaimed release Resident Evil Village. A new update, initially spotted by DSOG, seemingly frees the survival horror sequel of the anti-tamper software that had reportedly been causing frustrating performance issues.
When Resident Evil Village first launched for PC in May of 2021, players were disappointed to find the title laden with problems, from frame rate drops to stuttering audio and other random bugs. Players pointed to the resource-heavy DRM software which, it was claimed, was gobbling up vital resources needed to operate the visually splendid adventure. These accusations were offered validity after "cracked" editions of the sequel stripped the game of its DRM and were seen to run far smoother.
Capcom has previously removed the Denuvo software from other games in its Steam catalog, including the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, as well as hack 'n' slasher Devil May Cry 5. So why has it taken almost two years for Village to follow suit? Cynically, one could suggest that Denuvo is only being added to scare off early pirates, with Capcom essentially pulling the tech once it believes that a title's "honeymoon period" is over. Regardless, if you have been holding off purchasing Village on PC because of the Denuvo factor, then it seems that the concern is no more. It will be interesting to see if everybody playing on that platform suddenly starts reporting a much-improved gameplay experience.
Resident Evil Village is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And they're mini.
After months of silence, the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series is finally dropping on Switch on 19th April. And along with eShop listings for all six games in the series, we have a good idea of how much space all the games will take up on our SD cards. (Thanks, Nintendo Everything!)
While a lucky few have physical editions (and a rather expensive Anniversary Edition) coming their way, the Pixel Remaster series' digital versions can be bought as a bundle or downloaded individually on the eShop. And file sizes range from around 600 MB to just over 1 GB, depending on the game.

The details were shared on Twitter by Serebii, who revealed that Typhlosion will start popping up in 7-Star Tera Raids from 14th to 16th April, and then again from 21st to 23rd April. It will be a Ghost Tera Type, which is a nice nod to its Fire/Ghost-type Hisuian form in Legends: Arceus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rabbit hole is no more
In glum news for Gothic gaming fans everywhere, producer and screenwriter American McGee has seemingly confirmed that EA has rejected his pitch for a third title in the cult platform adventure series American McGee's Alice. The second sequel, tentatively title Alice: Asylum, will no longer move forward as planned, with the series creator currently convinced that the series has come to an end.
Having built up a following via crowdfunding website Patreon, McGee took various materials to the publisher, including concept art, design documents, a narrative outline, and a development "bible", but it seems that EA simply didn't have the same interest or passion for the project as McGee and his backers. Speaking on Twitter, McGee suggests that this motion not only represents an "endpoint" for the Alice universe, but also for his own interest in the game development industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roV8oWmL9q4&ab_channel=AmericanMcGee
The original American McGee's Alice launched on PC in 2000 and told a particularly grim tell of Lewis Carrol's troubled young hero as she returns to a darkened take on Wonderland. This extremely cult release would be followed up in 2011 with action-heavy sequel Alice: Madness Returns. It should be noted that both titles are merely "fine" at best, but still garnered loyal, dedicated fanbases due to their curiously dark tastes, strange weapon designs, and intriguing takes on the Alice in Wonderland mythos.
McGee has attempted to get Alice: Asylum off of the drawing desk for many, many years, and it seems that this fight has taken its toll on the will and patience of the creator. McGee notes that he has no interest in developing further video games, and, should any company ever pick up the Alice license, then they will likely be making further titles without his input.
Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
Indeed.

Konami has revealed that Super Bomberman R 2 is blasting onto Switch on 13th September in North America, and 14th September in Europe and Japan. Physical versions of the game will available in North America a day earlier. (Thanks, Gematsu!)
Revealed last June, Super Bomberman R 2 is a sequel to 2017's Super Bomberman R and is packed full of explosive features — both old and new — so it promises to be a content blowout. The brand new Castle Mode sees you either attacking or defending a castle, trying to steal or protect all of the keys. You can even design your own castle stages and share them online.

If one Persona game is positively begging to be remade, then it's probably the 2006 entry Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3. A port of Persona 3 Portable made its way to the Switch earlier this year alongside Persona 4 Golden, but when you compare the third game to the later entries in the franchise, it's undoubtedly starting to show its age considerably.
Well, if recent footage posted online is to be believed, then a full-blown remake of Persona 3 may well be on the cards. Coming in at a gargantuan five seconds in length, the footage from Twitter user @AVtoGAMEnoYAMI forms part of what is supposedly a video from a 2021 internal meeting over at SEGA Japan (the game's developer, Atlus, is a subsidiary of SEGA). It showcases one of the game's main protagonists, Yukari Takeba, summoning her Persona before launching a wave of arrows at an enemy.

Hello chums, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we get stuck in with this week's three-way battle, let's take a look at how last week's brawl went down. It was Kirby's Adventure's time to shine, with box art from North America and Europe going up against Japan in a classic duel. Rather surprisingly, in this humble writer's opinion, the Western design won by a sizeable margin, taking in 69% of the vote over Japan. Both designs are pretty great, mind.

Studio Wildcard also went into more detail as to why this upgraded version is no longer a free update, and why they feel it's necessary to shut down Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers.

McGee says that Electronic Arts have decided to pass on the project. As such, McGee says he has "reached an endpoint with 'Alice' and with game production in general."

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/rezon-arcade-archives-hamster-shmups-retro/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rezon-arcade-archives-hamster-shmups-retro"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[R-Trope
You might find yourself doing a double-take at this week's Arcade Archives release — And nobody could blame you for suffering something of a sense of deja vu, as Hamster reaches into the bottomless well of old-school shmups and pulls out Allumer's suspiciously familiar Rezon.
Released to the arcade market in 1991, Rezon is a space-themed horizontal shmup, which puts the player in the cockpit of a hi-tech vessel, blasting off in a hazardous mission to the stars. As you battle your way through waves of enemy ships, ground walkers, and snaking, pattern-based baddies, your ship can be outfitted with a variety of cool new weapons and abilities, all of which will be more than necessary to redress the balance, as Rezon is nothing if not absolutely rock solid — borderline relentless.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Martinoz.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwXmOUfCpEQ&ab_channel=Martinoz
But let's address the elephant in the room: It's R-Type. It's shamelessly R-Type. Not in the sense that titles such as SNK's Last Resort are "kinda R-Type". Rezon is almost a direct clone, with carbon copy stage layouts, enemies, weapon designs, and general gameplay flow. Allumer's rip-off doesn't have the excellent bosses of Irem's 1987 hit, but it has practically everything else.
Unsurprisingly, Rezon did not make its way to any home platform, perhaps more than aware of the questionable legal situation it might find itself in if too many eyes looked its way. Still, despite its xeroxed nature, it should be noted that Rezon provides a helluva challenge for hardened arcade fans, and is still worth a quick blast for the more dedicated of shmuppers.
Rezon is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Ever since the Harvest Moon franchise was forcibly uncoupled from the Bokujō Monogatari franchise from Marvelous, it's had trouble finding its footing in the surprisingly competitive farm sim genre. Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley and Harvest Moon: Skytree Village attempted to mix the traditional crop-raising gameplay with a Minecraft-inspired voxel world. The results were less than stellar. Harvest Moon: Light of Hope revisited the top-down feel of the original game with mixed results, and the less said about Harvest Moon: One World, the better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OF COURSE!
Following on from the news earlier this week that Legendary Entertainment has acquired the film and TV rights to Street Fighter, Capcom has confirmed that a brand new movie is in the works at the Dune, Godzilla, and Jurassic World production studio.
Of course, there is basically nothing else to go on — I'd be surprised if a script has even been rough drafted at this point — but we can likely expect the picture to be a live-action affair, and to feature a relatively violent affair involving lots of punches, kicks, and spinning piledrivers... Well, Maybe not the last one. We'll see. Whether the events of the movie will focus on classic SF adventures, encompass modern characters such as Luke and Juri, or be some wild amalgamation of the universe is, for now, all up for speculation.
https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1643660498150227977?s=20
Capcom will no doubt be looking to at least match, (and hopefully surpass), the critical and financial bar raised by Warner Bros. 2021 release, Mortal Kombat. And given Hollywood's increasing lean towards "somewhat good" video game movies, SF fans will be hoping to see an authentic and exciting adventure that steps high above the poorly paced slog that is Street Fighter (1994) and the head-scratchingly off-brand Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009)
In the meantime, we can all concentrate on the upcoming launch of Street Fighter 6, a title that Capcom hopes will propel the legendary fighting franchise back to the forefront of the gaming scene. And given the initial response to the character roster, the new modes, and the hugely successful beta tests, Ryu and chums are gearing up to deliver a whole new era of entertainment for the 35-year-old franchise.

Capcom has proudly announced that its recent release, Resident Evil 4, has already smashed past four million shipments and digital sales since its initial launch on March 24, less than a fortnight ago.
"The Resident Evil franchise features survival horror games in which players utilize a variety of weapons and other items to escape terrifying situations," wrote the publisher in a press statement. "Cumulative shipments of the games in the series now exceed 135 million units since the first title debuted in 1996. Now, more than 27 years later, continuous support from the passionate fan base across the globe makes it Capcom’s flagship game series."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id2EaldBaWw&ab_channel=ResidentEvil
The meticulous, ground-up remake of the 2005 GameCube classic has already seen smash success, both critically and from a sales perspective with critics and fans, offering intense action, grisly visuals, and reimagined versions of classic boss battles and iconic setpieces, all powered by a WoK3 SouNdTraCk. Three million sales of Resident Evil 4 took place within the game's first two days of release, with a further million copies shifting in the following week.
This is, of course, not even the end of the road for Resident Evil 4, as fans can expect the monster-mashing mode The Mercenaries arrived as a free update for all players just yesterday. In addition, rumors persist that the enjoyable, Ada Wong-driven side-mode "Separate Ways" is also currently in the works, to be released as DLC for the remake at a later date. The incredible success of Resident Evil 4 sets publisher Capcom up for a stellar year, with titles such as Exoprimal, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy, and Street Fighter 6 still on deck for 2023.
Resident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie is on everyone's lips right now. And why? Because it's a pretty darn big deal. We've talked about the movie at length, looking at its Easter eggs to simply just having a chat over a cuppa. But two Nintendo Life staffers still have stuff to get off of their chests, and this is their chance to finally let loose.
While we scored the movie a 6/10, calling it more of a "spectacle" than a film with much story, there's plenty to love about Mario's big screen adventure. get cosy with your Easter eggs, a beverage, and something cosy, as we go over our thoughts and feelings on the Mario Movie, including our favourite bits, what didn;t quiet work for us, and what we really want to see next.

Good Weekend to one and all, and welcome to a fairly subdued edition of Whatcha Been Playing? As those of you who have been paying attention will be aware, I'm not so peachy at the moment. Unfortunately, this cruddiness is rolling into week two, and as such I'm not really feeling myself in any form of fashion. Regardless, it is Saturday, and I hope that today will bring me some rest, bring you some good times, and will bring every last one of us a little sunshine, both literally and metphorically.

We did it, everyone! We made it through the opening week of The Super Mario Bros. Movie and still live to tell the tale.
Yes, this week finally saw the release of the hotly anticipated Nintendo and Illumination co-production and was it worth the wait? Well, sort of. While we certainly had mixed feelings in our review, the stellar box office is proof of the film's undeniable mass appeal. We have been breaking down our favourite references, asking if there is a post-credits scene, and keeping an eye on that all-important merch.

That makes this Micro SD a premiere option for Steam Deck owners, who will benefit from faster copying times when transferring game directories from the internal storage to Micro SD or downloading from the internet, and game load times should also be as speedy as anything with this A2-rated drive.

After a number of delays, Nintendo has finally locked in a 21st April release for Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp.
The first "hands on" of this turn-based tactical strategy arrived this week and so far it seems to have been well-received. Here on Nintendo Life, we called it a "slicker, shinier and sassier" take on the original Game Boy Advance titles, and many other outlets agreed the new Switch version was a welcome return.

There's been a swirl of info on social media recently about Microsoft cracking down on emulators. Frustration soon gave way to rumor, but Microsoft is clearing the air and saying this has nothing to do with other companies, but its own platform policies.
Xbox Series X|S consoles had become popular tools for retro enthusiasts to run emulators. Users found it relatively easy to download, install, and run emulators that could play both retro and homebrew games. While that functionality seemingly persists in the pay-to-access developer mode, the standard retail mode recently lost access to these features.

The gaming industry is brutal. You need the right budget, a talented team, and a realistic working schedule to finish a project. These "best canceled video games" failed at least one of those three aspects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Turbo Hyper Over-violent
The retro-inspired FPS market is getting extremely crowded, and standing out is becoming more difficult than ever. Hyperviolent doesn’t really do a good job of doing that on the surface. Even the name is as interchangeable as Turbo Overkill and Ultrakill. It advertises violence, which you can get pretty much anywhere.
But taking the time to actually get into Hyperviolent reveals that it’s not just another retro-inspired FPS. It’s not just explosions and heavy metal music. It’s not as frenetic as Doom or Dusk; it’s actually more akin to the original System Shock.
As it makes its delayed landing in Early Access, Hyperviolent shows that it can stand out. However, there’s still a lot of work to do to actually make it worth playing.

Lots of us have already seen the long-awaited The Super Mario Bros. Movie and if there is one thing to take away from our initial viewing, it's that this thing is absolutely jam-packed with Yoshi Easter eggs and references.
We sort of knew that this was going to be the case. Each trailer gave us a taste of what was to come, but nothing could have prepared us for the sheer barrage of nods to Nintendo's past that would be heading our way each and every second.

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.
Today both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.

In what is arguably the most important discovery of the recent Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom overview, we learned that Link now has the power to fuse items together. This Dead Rising-esque mechanic seems fairly fluid and extends to multiple objects: not just weaponry. Of course, you can use it to forge new weapons and ammo...like the meat arrow.
Folks have been talking about raw meat arrows ever since the aforementioned walkthrough hovered over them ever so slightly, and the community has now made that a reality in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Popular Zelda modder Waikuteru just put out a new video detailing their meat arrow mod, which...adds meat arrows into the game.
Although you can get the gist in the first few minutes of the video below, Waikuteru walks us through all of the possibilities these new toys can bring to the table.
I'd welcome adding some of Tears of the Kingdom's mechanics back into Breath of the Wild
Adding a rudimentary fusion element into Breath of the Wild seems simple enough: and even if it doesn't have the same fully-featured functionality as Tears of the Kingdom, you're still flinging a meat arrow at an enemy at the end of the day. And based on this mod, they actually seem pretty viable. Plus, ammo is easier to find than ever!

I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.
Pill Baby is, obviously, all those things. It's far better and more coherent than any of those descriptions would make it sound.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pizza Time
Konami has announced that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection has crested 1 million copies sold. That’s a lot of pizza.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a compilation of 13 games made throughout Konami’s time with the license. While this mostly just means it’s the Arcade titles and well-known ports, it also includes some less-beloved titles, such as the various iterations of The Tournament Fighters. The ports were handled by Digital Eclipse, who did a great job bringing the games over and including some awesome extras.
https://twitter.com/Konami/status/1644324155125559298?s=20
Personally, I feel The Cowabunga Collection is incredibly important. Licensed games are among the most difficult to get modern ports of, simply because the publisher often has to reacquire rights, and the costs there can mean that it’s simply not a profitable venture. I felt that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games were among the most unfortunate victims of this limitation, as they are some of the best licensed games developed. Having them left on platforms that are no longer supported would have been an unfortunate fate.
Thankfully, Konami has been mining its dragon’s horde of old titles recently with compilations like Castlevania Anniversary Collection. While I feel like the publisher is better known for pissing all over its history, I love being proven wrong, and their recent collections, including the Cowabunga Collection, have been heartening.
Now that I’ve offered some praise, I must now make demands for compilations of games such as Ganbare Goemon, Parodius, and a scattershot of unlocalized Famicom titles.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is available on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are proud to announce that network-enabled Humongous Entertainment titles are now playable online! Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.

It's an area we'll likely see Intel continue to invest in as Sierra Forest comes next year with 144 E cores per socket. Already with the Linux kernel patches Intel is carrying at the moment via their in-house distribution, there are some significant benefits for Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. 


And yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.


After spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Falling-block puzzle games get a gory makeover in Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine, a spin-off from Super Meat Boy. Rather than dodging buzzsaws and baddies while platforming, here you'll be doing that while dropping coloured blobs into grids to match chains of colours and make 'em vanish. You can see that for yourself, as Mean Meat Machine now has a free demo offering a taste ahead of the game's launch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: 
It's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?
Surprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. 
Over 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.

For one, the game can be played alone, and though their animations differ, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy all play the same. It's not a Super Mario Bros. 2 situation where they all run at different speeds and jump different heights. No matter who your favorite character is (Donald being an early cont…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. 


But for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.

The team modded Half-Life 2 last year and followed it up with a mod for Half-Life 2: Episode One a couple of weeks ago. They’re now back with Half-Life 2: VR Mod - Episode Two, coming to Steam later today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.
In Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ask RPS returns today with a question that takes us right back to the beginning of how we all got here. Not in the scientific, evolutionary sense of all of human history, I should add, but rather how we, the RPS Treehouse, ended up writing about video games for a living.
The question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?
A sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.
I recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.

Or you can just jail them. It looks like lighthearted fun, and it’ll be hitting PC and consoles later this year.

Remedy’s time-bending Quantum Break - part superpowered shooter, part live-action TV show - has been delisted on Steam and The Microsoft Store. The game’s Steam page is still up, but it’s no longer available for purchase on PC or Xbox consoles. Publisher Microsoft had already confirmed the game would be “temporarily” removed from Game Pass (for console, it was never on the PC version) due to licensing issues, although there was no word on a removal from storefronts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is an RPG unabashedly inspired by the 16-bit era of Japanese RPGs. Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.
Dozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below.

In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.
Lifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.
New Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.
Several new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.
New Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.
Among several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.
It’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.
God of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
You can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.]]></summary>

Unsuprisingly, then, I've been very excited to get my hands on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, a retro FPS by Auroch Digital set within the grim-dark universe of Warhammer 40k. A retro shooter where you play as a Space Marine is so obvious a pairing it's a wonder the concept has never been tackled before, to the point where the game's own marketing materials sort of pretend that it already was back in the 90s but everyone just forgot about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spooky fishing game Dredge is overflowing with underwater eldritch horrors, ghoulish critters, and mutant fishies - like, the Blinky-the-fish kind. Based on that description, you’d expect some three-headed sea beast, incomprehensibly twisted and glowing with an otherworldly light, to be the game’s most supreme being. Nope. That title goes to the dog you rescue in one of the game's side missions, the developers have revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may remember Defender’s Quest: Valley Of The Forgotten as the beloved early-2010s game that swapped the towers in tower-defence, with humans that you could level up and customise. Essentially an RPG/tower-defence hybrid. You might also remember that a sequel was announced before it somewhat fell off the map - you probably don’t remember since it happened a decade ago, to be fair. Regardless, Defender’s Quest 2: Mists Of Ruin is now ready to re-emerge into the public’s consciousness with a 2023 PC release. 


Developer Level Up Labs and publisher Armor Games have released a new trailer to mark the re-announcement:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An important Star Wars question is: what colour lightsaber would you have? The lightsaber is the mood ring of elegant weapons for a more civilised age. Jason de Heras, design director on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, agrees with me on the purple blade (a colour introduced to the canon specifically because Samuel L. Jackson wanted it for his character in the prequels). "I was like, 'we gotta have a pink lightsaber blade'," says production director Kasumi Shishido. "So whenever I play I always stick with my pink saber."
Shishido tells me the dev team focused on improving on Jedi: Fallen Order for this sequel, and one of the bigger areas where they did that was customisation. "We knew we wanted to put more resources and effort into it," she says. "There's a lot more that you can do with Cal, with BD... and just within Cal, it's not just outfits you can customise, so I'm just really excited to see what players are going to do with it."

The project comes from production company and distributor Universal Pictures and animation studio Illumination.

Nintendo was involved not as a licensor but as a partner with Illumination and Universal. 
Every step of the way, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who is credited as a producer on this film alongside Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, had creative input regarding the story, characters, and references to the games.

With a busy four days in Boston for PAX East, mine and Liam's brains were basically mush last week, so Rebecca - an absolute angel - graciously said she could host a special PAX East episode where she chats with Liam and me about the indies we saw on the show floor and try desperately to string together a coherent sentence. She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.
Saying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.

I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going "full pipe" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. 
But also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crusader Kings 3's next expansion has been announced. Tours & Tournaments will introduce new events to the medieval grand strategy game including jousting events, grand weddings and the ability to send you ruler on a tour of their domain. All offer an opportunity to impress your subjects and rivals - or, I'd guess, to fall off your horse and die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1993, the Super Mario Bros. made their big-screen debut through a live-action adventure starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper. While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.
Warning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, certain elements of the narrative and characters are mentioned throughout this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.


While some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that "Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game." That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.
Nintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  
"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a "national treasure" and "mandatory reading in high school" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's "had to deal with" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this "isn't a one-to-one adaptation" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.

Not so with The Last of Us Part 1, which as you’ve probably seen, has launched in a technical state that’s bleaker than Joel’s face. The first few patches and hotfixes (more are planned) have made it somewhat less terrible on powerful desktops, but I’m sad to report that playing The Last of Us Part 1 on the Steam Deck is not currently worth your time.

Not only did we find a bunch of cool games to play, but we were also able to chat to the games' creators, as all Rising finalists are invited to attend in person to show their work to the public. 
This year, though, Rachel and I decided to go one step further. We interviewed the teams behind four of the eleven 2023 finalists, asking the developers behind Go-Go Town!, Paper Trail, Slay the Princess and Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action about their experience of bringing their games to PAX, what they learned along the way, and what it’s like to spend four days standing on your feet talking to thousands of attendees (spoilers: it’s really bloody tiring).

It's very wholesome. We've got more community videos coming out this week, plus an article listing our absolute favourite games we played throughout the entire event, so keep your eyes peeled for those, too.

After playing four hours of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor last week, I can tell you it is exactly what you probably already thought it would be: a competent, big-budget action-adventure sequel, well made by talented people, that isn't breaking the mould but expands upon the first game in the areas you liked best. If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you. But if you were less well disposed towards that first game, you'd probably want to swap "consistent" for the word "predictable".

When Respawn Entertainment announced it was making a third-person action game in the Star Wars universe, many fans didn’t know how to react; the studio was critically acclaimed, but at the time, Respawn was purely known for shooters like Titanfall and Apex Legends. However, 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order surpassed the expectations of many, delivering a terrific adventure full of exciting action and memorable moments. Now, with all the learnings of Fallen Order, Respawn is ready to top itself in hopes of creating another unforgettable Star Wars adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham (RPS in peace) text me yesterday and, with little warning, launched into what were clearly pre-prepared paragraphs of complaints about games he'd tried playing in his free time at the weekend and not enjoyed. I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.
It's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.

Hello! I am the second imposter covering for our dear Ed, who is currently away on holiday in Japan (and I’m definitely not jealous at all). Let’s get into some good words, shall we?
Wired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.
His time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”

To compensate, they're going to instead release Ark: Survival Ascended in August, a remaster of the original Ark: Survival Evolved that moves it over to Unreal Engine 5. That's the good news. The bad news is you can only buy it in a $50 bundle with the sequel (which won't be finished for at least a year), and that the original Survival Evolved servers will be switched off when Ascended launches.

        <updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games," said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. "Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans."
"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule."
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

It’s the biggest weekend of the year for WWE, but some folks may not realize that it’s also a massive event for the entire industry. The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.
The same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…]]></summary>

As a lifelong fan of Nintendo, the experience was immense, providing me with one of my favorite amusement park experiences ever. Naturally, when the first Super Nintendo World in America opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, I had to make the trip to Los Angeles to see how the experience stacks up.
Universal Studios provided me with a day pass to the park for the purpose of experiencing Super Nintendo World. While the photos do little to show off just how cool the experience of visiting Super Nintendo World is, follow along with my experience in the gallery below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first chapter of Videoverse took me right back to the early 00s last night. I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. 
Luckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.

I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.
I suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?

Windy Meadow is set in the same fantasy world as Roadwarden and similarly presents a slice-of-life story that can branch out depending on your choices. This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. 


Windy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”

Last year we highlighted the show's thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.


Encouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year's show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.


 Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?

IGN reported on Tuesday that major publishers had either declined to attend or had little to no idea if the event would even take place due to an alleged lack of communication with organizer ReedPop and the ESA.

On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.
Playing with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.

        <updated>2023-03-30T14:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.]]></summary>

And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he's like, 'Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…]]></summary>

The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here. You can also check out this story on how Square Enix recently absorbed developer Luminous Productions.]]></summary>

It's been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn't hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, developer Deck 13 revealed that its upcoming action RPG, Atlas Fallen, would arrive May. Now today, less than a month later, Deck 13 has announced that the game has been delayed to August. 
More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix
Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.

Despite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting.

The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daedalic Entertainment revealed The Lord of the Rings: Gollum way back in 2019, announcing that it would be released in 2021. In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it's planned for later this year. Alongside today's news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure," a press release reads. "Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol." 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below: 

For more about The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, check out this trailer highlighting the game's supporting cast and then check out this trailer featuring some of the game's stealth-based gameplay. Watch this trailer showing off the game's parkour gameplay after that.

Its specialty is developing immersive sims, a niche it’s helped cultivate since 1999. On May 2, Arkane releases its next project, Redfall, an open-world first-person shooter.
I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails' Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10. For more on Sonic Origins, check out our review from the base compilation here.]]></summary>

The Nier: Automata tracks "Dependent Weakling," "Weight of the World Kowaretasekainouta – Marina Kawano," "Amusement Park," "A Beautiful Song," And "Emil's Shop," will be added to the game on March 29. That's next Wednesday, so you don't have to wait long. Check out Square Enix's trailer showcasing these songs in the Tweet below:

These five songs will join the recently-added six songs from The World Ends With You series. That DLC pack added "Someday," "Your Ocean," "World is Yours," "Breaking Free," "Twister," and "Calling." Song packs typically cost $3 to $6 depending on the pack, but you'll get all of these NEO songs and all of these Nier songs if you've purchased Season Pass 1. 
We love the game, and you can find out why in Game Informer's Theatrhythm Final Bar Line review.
