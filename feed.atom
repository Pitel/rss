The retro market is going to keep getting bigger, and the appreciation for retro hardware continues to grow.
If the tale of homebrew started with bootlegs and ROM hacks, progressed into hacked cartridges, then new cartridges produced by small companies like Super Fighter Team and RetroUSB would be the third phase. For Super Fight Team’s part, they began by translating and porting Chinese Sega Genesis games and reproducing them on new cartridges.

Baldur's Gate 3 is just under a month away, at this point, and today Larian Studios hosted a Panel From Hell to celebrate the impending launch on PC. It featured a new Origin character with a unique playstyle, tons of gameplay details, and one very fraught scene with a Druid.
One of the big reveals of the Panel was the new Origin character, teased in its online mystery game, who is more like an Origin archetype: the Dark Urge. Much like Larian's work on Divinity, Baldur's Gate 3 will have the option to play as either a created character or one of the Origin characters who would otherwise be party members, like Shadowheart or Astarion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is he related to the Berenstein Bears?
Uh oh. It looks like CERN may have fired again. We're now in a timeline graced by the existence of Fiddlebert. Of course, you remember Fiddlebert from Pikmin, right? For those that don't; Fiddlebert was supposedly Pikmin 1's second captain. He was "rushed" since he was just a smaller and green version of Olimar. He would sometimes randomly speak another language and was removed from the Wii and Switch ports of the game...at least, that's what folks on the Pikmin subreddit would have you believe.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/14pn5qe/who_the_fuck_is_fiddlebert/
Pikmin fans are currently debating the existence of the green character. Some claim they certainly remember him from the original Pikmin. But let's be honest here. Fiddlebert is as real as Curious George's tail, Oscar Meyer, and the Monopoly Man's monocle. You know, as real as the cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo.
[caption id="attachment_390706" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Nat on Cohost[/caption]
Do you "remember" Fiddlebert?
The creation of Fiddlebert is what happens when a dedicated fan base gets together and wants to pass the time before a highly anticipated game release. We saw a similar situation in the Diablo 4 community. It's honestly great! You have a large group of people all excited for Pikmin 4 and willing to take something silly and run with it. Why you might ask? Because it's fun, it's entertaining, and most importantly it's more Pikmin.
Look, I know the Mandela effect is a real thing. I mean at this point who can argue it? But I have to admit, I don't remember Fiddlebert ever existing. Maybe I just didn't play Pikmin as much as I remember, but surely I'd recognize this green Olimar, right?
Pikmin 4 releases on Nintendo Switch on July 21. I'm willing to bet Fiddlebert will not make an appearance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

The highlight of the recent Diablo Developer Update was certainly the reveal of Diablo 4 Season of the Malignant. However, Diablo Immortal also got some big news with the unveiling of a brand new class. The Blood Knight is the first new class in the entire Diablo franchise since the release of Diablo III's Crusader in 2014.
Diablo Immortal certainly isn't for everyone. But despite launching with an extremely predatory monetization system, the mobile-focused action-RPG still went on to make over $500 million in just one year. Surprisingly, the Blood Knight will be free and accessible to everyone when it releases on July 13.

If you looked at it and went "ooh", your coo lobe was right. "Design a vehicle" games are often too fiddly and/or competition-oriented for me, and trucking games too businesslike and grounded. This threads the needle beautifully. It's challenging, but gently, prioritising an approachable design and smooth controls without sacrificing the satisfaction of solving a decent engineering puzzle. It's even pretty, so that even plain driving back and forth is pleasant and rewarding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "space dog" Oatchi rides again
Pikmin 4 is gearing up for a July 21 launch, but Nintendo started the marketing campaign in earnest in the last Nintendo Direct, which dedicated a decent chunk of time toward the new series entry. Of course, the next stage of that campaign: My Nintendo swag!
As you may recall, Nintendo celebrated the re-release Pikmin 3 in 2020 with a sticker and coaster set. Well, in a recent news post on the My Nintendo site, the publisher confirmed that there will be a sticker set coming in the future for Pikmin 4. Here's the full rundown from Nintendo:
"Add some cuteness to your smooth surfaces with these lovely 3” x 3” stickers! One features a Blue Pikmin, a Yellow Pikmin, and a Red Pikmin ready for whatever’s next. The other shows an explorer and a squad of Pikmin riding on the back of space dog Oatchi."

Given the timeframe of prior announcements, it could be anywhere between 1-2 weeks until we see the set go up on the My Nintendo storefront. Expect the price to be in line with prior sticker sets on the service, ranging from 300-500 Platinum Points.
There's also a Pikmin 4 demo promo for free Platinum
In other My Nintendo news, there's a Pikmin 4 retailer demo promo going on soon, which can net you 200 Platinum Points.
All you need to do is play the demo of the game at select retailers, then scan a QR code at the end. That's it! This particular gimmick will be running from July 7 through October 19, so you have plenty of time. Nintendo mentions Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart by name.
Update (July 7, 2023) - The Pikmin 4 stickers are now available
Good news! The stickers became available in record time. You can find them right here for 200 Platinum Points.
Remember that you can bundle multiple items together so you aren't paying standard shipping for a few stickers.

Bloomberg has reported that Sega is pulling back its plans to compete in the Web3 Thunderdome. The company was previously shoveling coal into the crypto furnace; licensing blockchain games, and creating NFTs based on its properties.
Sega hasn’t canceled all of its crypto plans, but we’re watching in real time as the corporation realizes its mistake. Bloomberg reports that Sega “will withhold its biggest franchises from third-party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content.” “We’re looking into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry, after all,” co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi told Bloomberg News. Sega will apparently be pulling back from play-to-earn games and is reassessing its Web3 approach to the company's big-budget online multiplayer-focused so-called “super games” that are planned to start releasing in 2026.
This, of course, is all in response to the ongoing decline in the crypto market that some have dubbed the "Crypto Winter." The unfortunate part of this is that it’s largely a case of big executives and billionaires buying into an obvious scam, and many of them won’t really see any consequences for the poor decision-making. Instead, it's the people below them that will get the brunt of it. Meta laid off 10,000 employees when it became apparent that the Metaverse was a Web3 black hole that it was dropping money into. What a world.
Thankfully, no layoffs have been announced for Sega, but considering the blockchain plans were announced in 2021 following a low sales forecast… I don’t want to think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the mind that brought us Silent Hill
For all you horror fans out there, Bokeh Game Studio has uploaded a video diary for the upcoming Slitterhead. This is a brand-new psychological horror game from Keiichirō Toyama, better known as the creator of the first Silent Hill.
In this latest video, the developer gives a brief behind-the-scenes look at the tests that have been done on an early build of Slitterhead. In the footage, we are treated to a few details about the work done so far, which includes some brief glimpses from the game (keep in mind that it's still very much in early development).
https://youtu.be/XYrOO0SLUAI
As well as this sneak peek of the project, we're also told that the game will feature "unique mechanics," which have apparently gone down quite well with testers so far. What these mechanics actually are is a mystery. In fact, there's still not a huge amount known about Slitterhead, including when it's likely to release. Given that it's still in the early stages, it's probably going to be a while.
A new horror awaits
Bokeh Game Studio was founded in 2020 by Toyama after his departure from Sony. He also brought onboard Junya Okura and Kazunobu Sato, both of whom he worked with on the cult horror series Siren. Slitterhead will be the new team's maiden release.
Right now is an exciting time to be a horror fan. Whether it's remakes of classics or...well, okay, there are a lot of remakes at the moment. But the ones that have come about over the last few years have been pretty good.
There are also some great games on the indie scene, such as Iron Lung, not to mention the new Amnesia game has been scaring the pants off people. So the genre is very much alive, and a lot of you will be looking forward to what Bokeh has to offer, especially given it has the director of the OG Silent Hill at the helm.

If you’re unfamiliar, these games are essentially interactive movies. The most popular example is the Dragon’s Lair games. You could also look at the various FMV games that came around in the early ‘90s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sparkin' good result.
Monolith Soft had a cracking 2022 with the release of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, one of our favourite games of the year and a culmination of everything the developer has learned. And it shows in a recent report acquired by Gamebiz.jp (via Noisy Pixel), as the developer has almost doubled its profits in the fiscal year ending March 2023.
According to the Official Gazette's financial report, the RPG developer — which also helps Nintendo with many of its big releases, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — made 800 million yen in the year starting 1st April 2022 and ending 31st March 2023. In contrast, the previous fiscal year saw the company make around 404 million yen. That's an increase of 97.8%, which is pretty staggering. In 2022, Monolith Soft also worked with Nintendo on Splatoon 3.

We were going to talk about children's games this week, but given the game for children I was going to talk about was once Stadia exclusive Gylt it seemed a time to talk about the precariousness of digital media a bit (and also make James explain Stadia).


We've all been playing a few games here and there, and most of them are current, with Nate still very enthusiastic about being a dinosaur. James comes with more beans to the hardware altar, and we all have some slightly weird suggestions for your recommendations. Plus, because Liam is actually away this week, I made a special effort to pay attention to audio levels and reduce background noise because I've seen ye all complaining about when I have to edit the podcast and I'm sick of it.

Just a few weeks ago, Capcom asked if fans would like more Resident Evil remakes. The survey's over now, but it seems the studio is wondering whether it should continue bringing back older entries in its iconic survival horror series. It's a pretty lucrative venture, after all.
Taking that a tiny step further, a recent general shareholder meeting with Capcom shows that there may be some spinoff remakes being considered. In the summary document (as spotted by GamesRadar), a question is asked about whether the company will be "providing high-end visual remakes of only the main numbered entries in the Resident Evil series?"

This is a story that hearkens back to the ye olden times of gaming. The official Nintendo customer service Twitter account is now warning people not to blow into their Switch console in any attempt to fix any issues. More specifically, it doesn't want you to utilize your own spittle in order to clear out any dust that may be lurking in the cartridge slot.
A tweet from the company says the area in which you insert your Switch game "has a terminal" which is used to read the said game. It then goes on to say that one should not clean this area out with a cotton swab, nor should a cartridge that's damaged be inserted, lest it corrupts the terminal inside the machine. This is accompanied by a simple diagram illustrating this faux pas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.
News of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was "found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). 
This sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. 
Naka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. 
Less than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). 
Naka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading.

IGN first reported the announcement yesterday after spotting tributes to Morel on LinkedIn. Ubisoft Montpellier, the primary Ubisoft studio leading development on Beyond Good and Evil 2, then released a statement about Morel's passing on LinkedIn as well: 
Morel joined Ubisoft in 2009, according to his LinkedIn, and his credits in games include Rayman Legends and The Adventures of Tintin. He was an associate creative director on Beyond Good and Evil 2 before being promoted to creative director earlier this year (via Kotaku). Before Ubisoft, Morel worked at Eden Games on Test Drive Unlimited and the Alone in the Dark series.

I don’t usually go for nails Metriodvanias, but there’s something about Gunbrella’s slick, parkour platforming and scrappy world that made me wanna give it a chance. Oh, and the deadly brolly, of course. I mean, it’s a gunbrella. What else is there to say?
The demo I played at PAX is now available to download and play on Steam, and I highly recommend it. Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.

He also stated that the brand's biggest characters won't be associated with NFTs to avoid devaluing the IP.

You might remember back in 2020 and 2021, there was a boatload of legal drama surrounding the rather brilliant shmup Devil Engine, whereby the game's artist and composer - siblings Thomas and Joseph Bailey - had claimed that developer Tristan Chapman (known on Twitter as 'Sinoc229') had been utilising their respective work in the game without permission, going so far as to request players don't purchase the game.
Despite the less-than-amicable conclusion to the drama, however, it looks like a full physical release of Devil Engine: Complete Edition is now in the works and is due to be released on October 12th, 2023 from publishers Beep Japan and Poppy Works. A physical release in the West will be announced at a later date, however pre-orders can currently be processed through either Amazon Japan or PlayAsia.

Arc System Works has announced that the 2016 3DS title, River City: Rival Showdown. is coming to PC, Switch, and PlayStation platforms.
River City: Rival Showdown was the second Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City title to be released on the 3DS, following River City: Tokyo Rumble in 2013. Both were similar titles that take the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City beat-’em-up formula started in 1986’s Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun/Renegade and cemented in 1989’s Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari/River City Ransom. Chubby arms, pained expressions, and lots of smacking take center stage in these games.

The new port of River City: Rival Showdown will include all the features of the 3DS version but will also include a brand new prequel story called Cold-Blooded Hardcore Yamada-kun. Beyond that, there will also be spiffier graphics and some quality-of-life improvements.
I’d call myself a huge fan of the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City games, but I’ve had trouble getting myself into the more modern titles. I own River City: Rival Showdown on 3DS. I just couldn’t tell you why I haven’t played more than a few minutes of it.
Oh, wait, yes, I can. It was a horrible time in my life. I wish I hadn’t remembered that.
In any case, I’ll hopefully be giving this one another chance. If you haven’t already, you should definitely check out Double Dragon & Kunio-kun: Retro Brawler Bundle. It has all the Famicom games in the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City series, but they’ve gone the extra mile and localized all the ones that were previously Japan-only. Seriously, an impressive effort.
River City: Rival Showdown will be releasing on PC, Switch, and PlayStation on October 12, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you there, God?
Crate Entertainment has revealed what it has in store for the August update of their Early Access survival city-builder, Farthest Frontier. The headline feature here is a new religion system, but it also promises paper industry and guild halls.
Farthest Frontier is coming up on a year in early access. It’s a “colony sim” or a “survival city builder.” This burgeoning sub-genre has followed in the wake of the success of 2014’s Banished. It seems a lot of developers felt tired of waiting for a sequel to Banished and have decided to create their own sequels, each tying in a different twist. The base is that you need to focus on the survival of your settlers, but from there, the concept has gone in some interesting directions.
I’ve actually played Farthest Frontier, and while it’s not as big of a twist as Timberborn’s beaver people, it’s definitely a solid game, even in its current state. It’s detailed, pretty, and has that nice mix of relaxing and stressful.
However, there’s room to expand, and religion sounds like it will be a great addition. Nothing livens up a peasant’s sad existence quite like the fear of an unhappy deity. The central mechanic of religion is finding relics that will “inspire reverence” and provide your people with perks. Personally, I prefer a good sacrifice, but this sounds good too.
There is also the introduction of the paper industry, which will allow you to create books; a luxury item for your settlers. There are also guild halls that will boost a chosen industry in your settlement, allowing you to pick your focus. In the future, Crate Entertainment is teasing tweaks to combat, quality of life, mods, and the addition of new livestock. Hopefully ducks.
Farthest Frontier is currently available on PC via Early Access. The update is planned for release in August.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where there's Smoke...
A fan-favorite is confirmed to be returning to the Mortal Kombat grinder. Today's new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1 reveals both Rain and Smoke will appear in the new entry.
Smoke is a well-liked member of the Lin Kuei, who finally gets a human re-debut in Liu Kang's new era. Here, Smoke is a fellow member of the Lin Kuei who joins with Scorpion and Sub-Zero to defend Earthrealm.
Also arriving is Rain, a High Mage of Outworld who wields water magic. He's looking a bit more robed and wizard-like, compared to his original palette-swapped appearance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66opZ1Go_ZA
Some Kameo fighters also make an appearance here, too. Scorpion pops up, of course. But the cyborg side of the Lin Kuei appears, too; Sektor and Cyrax are in as Kameos, as well as a human version of Frost.
For our two main roster fighters, both look pretty excellent. Smoke is obviously a highlight. His teleportation and quick jabs look fantastic, and that knife looks devastating in the X-ray attacks. Rain, meanwhile, is like a Waterbender that gets to actually do some damage with their aquatic magic. I really dig the big lightning ball attack that he can call down from a raincloud.
Kombat history
The Kameo fighters bring their own flavor too, and it's nice to see the cyborgs appear. I was curious about whether they would. With a new era and re-envisioned versions of characters, having the robo-fighters reappear or not felt up in the air.
After playing it at SGF 2023, though, it definitely seemed like Kameos are NetherRealm's way of including more fan-favorites from its ever-expanding universe without having to make them fully fledged fighters right away. If it keeps up the nostalgia and klassic references, I could see this being a really enjoyable experience for long-time MK fans.
Mortal Kombat 1 arrives on September 19, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There must be no games but third-person action games, said Sony. And so it was. Helldivers 2 is the next victim, trading the co-op sci-fi shooter's from-above camera view for a from-behind perspective that really screams 'hey it's every other game'.

A new post and a new trailer from developers Arrowhead explaining how Helldivers 2's combat and co-op works is, at least, an opportunity to differentiate itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From IO down to Brighton
IO Interactive has announced that they’ve got new digs. They’ve opened a studio in Brighton, United Kingdom to assist with their titles, Project 007, Project Fantasy, and HITMAN.
According to the press release, the IO Interactive Brighton team is “already in place” and “located in the heart of Brighton on the beautiful south coast of England.” Most notably, they point out that having a studio actually in the UK is very appropriate when it comes to helping with Project 007.
IO Interactive Brighton joins the current studios located in Copenhagen, Malmö, Barcelona, and Istanbul.
“We are extremely proud and excited to open our next studio in Brighton, where we see enormous potential to expand our incredible team and attract the very best talent from the exciting UK development scene,” said Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive. ”We’re eager to expand our operations to new shores and believe that IOI Brighton is an extremely appealing destination for developers of all crafts.”
The press release also mentions one of their previous titles, Freedom Fighters, and refers to it as a “franchise.” It’s probably worth noting that there was only one game in the Freedom Fighters series, and that was released back in 2003. But since IO Interactive split with Square-Enix, they’ve hinted at wanting to return to it. We can only hope.

It took a bit longer than I expected, but the Diablo 4 hardcore contest has come to an end. Blizzard revealed on Twitter that 1000 qualifying players have hit level 100 on hardcore mode and will have their names carved into history. Unfortunately, the contest has been plagued by drama before it even began, and then some. Shortly after revealing the list of 1000 winners, the tweet became flooded by players claiming they should be on the list but aren't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, we learned that Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of Silent Hill, had opened Bokeh Game Studio to develop a new horror game. The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. 
Most of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Check it out for yourself: 


As you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: 
In 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetherRealm has revealed two more playable fighters joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster: Smoke and Rain. 
These two returning characters were revealed as actual fighters on the roster – they still could be part of the Kameo roster, however – in a new gameplay trailer released today focused on the Lin Kuei faction. In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. 
Check these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: 


"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm," a press release reads. "The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery." 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. 

Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023.

Emile Morel, a developer with a long legacy including many years at Ubisoft, has died at age 40.
News first began to spread around on LinkedIn, with colleagues posting tributes to Morel on the site (via IGN). Ubisoft Montpelier, his studio, has posted an official confirmation and statement:
It is with a heavy heart that we share the sudden passing of our friend and colleague Emile Morel. We send our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and teammates all over the world.
We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the significant impact he made over the years on different games that make up the rich history of our studio.
For us, Emile was a close friend and a boundless source of positive energy. We all valued his passion and the way he told stories.
We will never forget Emile and his immense contribution to the BGE2 universe will forever endure.
True Freedom Lies Beyond.

Beyond good and evil
Morel had worked at Ubisoft for some time, with 14 years of experience at the company working on several notable titles. Morel served as a senior designer on Rayman Legends, as well as working on Test Drive Unlimited 2, 2008's Alone in the Dark, and Rayman Fiesta Run.
After the departure of several leads from Beyond Good & Evil 2, Morel took over as creative director on the project. The sequel was revealed at E3 2017 and has been in development for some time since.
We extend our thoughts and condolences to Morel's loved ones and colleagues.

I'm not saying that we should ignore the kitty cats at all, but when you're presented with the dilemma of missing a quest that's simply about rescuing a tiny creature or venturing into the unknown to save the entire world, well, one of them is a more urgent and tempting prospect. Common in RPGs, open-world games, and adventure titles, sidequests offer up a plethora of activities that see you doing everything from collecting seashells to defeating dragons. Think of a random activity, — delivering a takeaway, doing the laundry, getting a haircut — and it's probably been a sidequest before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company revealed on July 6 a new trailer for Pokémon Sleep, the tracker app it first teased in 2019. The video, “How To Play Pokémon Sleep,” is likely the closest thing to a “gameplay” trailer we’re going to get, though it doesn’t include an official release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news for anyone with eyeballs
Square-Enix released a patch today for their newest, hottest hit, Final Fantasy XVI. Patch 1.03 is largely just a quality-of-life update with some small tweaks, but it notably allows you to reduce the intensity of motion blur or turn it off entirely. Thank the Gods of Visual Clarity for that.
Motion blur is one of those modern visual effects that some people don’t like. For example, I don’t like motion blur. In racing games, maybe, but essentially not any other time. Along with chromatic aberration and depth-of-field blur, it’s one of those things that developers really should allow you to turn off. It can be stylish, but it can also just look smudgy and ugly.
Also, when I need to take screenshots, if I’m playing a game that uses an intense motion blur, m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has released the first episode of its new Overwatch 2 anime series, Genesis. 
Today's episode is the first of three, and together, the series will focus on Omnic robots and how they went from human-made creations to what they are in the world of Overwatch 2. In Episode 1, Omnica Corp Scientists finally reveal the next generation of Omnics and it doesn't take long for them to ponder whether what they have done is good for society or the start of a new crisis. 
Check out Episode 1 of Genesis: An Overwatch 2 Anime Series for yourself below: 


While waiting for the next episode, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review and then check out our exclusive hands-on preview of the upcoming PvE story content hitting Overwatch 2 this August. 
Editor's Note: The text of this article has been updated to reflect the series is an anime series.

        <updated>2023-07-06T15:58:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. 
Stadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). 


Unfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass.

A mod that lets you slay hollowed enemies as Tony Hawk is a good guess, but Dark Souls Pro Skater is almost the reverse. A clip went viral over the weekend showing praise-the-sun-guy Solaire shredding around the game’s opening Firelink Shrine. And yes, it looks as cool as it sounds. 


You can watch the clip on Twitter, but if that cursed site’s not working, you can find it on YouTube. There’s also a version that has Shrek shredding but badly, for some reason. Firelink’s ancient, mysterious ruins are transformed into a fun skatepark. Who cares where the skaters came from? Just grind, Gwyndammnit.

Remember that slightly strange Pokémon Presents showcase earlier this year where we got such memorable announcements as *checks notes* the Pokémon GO Plus + and, uhhh... a premium collection of the original 151 cards? You might remember it as the one where we finally heard that Pokémon Sleep was a real thing and would be coming our way this year. Well, after the ensuing four months of relative silence on the matter, The Pokémon Company has today shared more details about the upcoming sleep tracker app.
Revealed in the above video titled "How To Play Pokémon Sleep" (spoiler: you go to sleep), we got a better look at what the lifestyle app is all about, showcasing some of its features and explaining your main objectives by taking part. What's more, Serebii.net has reported that the app is scheduled for release in late July, so there's not long to go now before you can finally... sleep..?

It's been nearly five years since the last mainline Mega Man game (and nearly two decades since the last mainline Mega Man X game - no big deal), so it's understandable at this point that fans of the franchise are eager to hear about where the franchise might be heading next.
Capcom is clearly rather fond of the Blue Bomber itself, having released a number of comprehensive collections over the years on Switch, including this year's Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. At its latest General Meeting of Shareholders, however, the publisher was asked about its plans for the series going forwards.

Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out on several platforms (Switch included!) on July 12, and it's definitely the big dog on campus this coming week. If you don't remember Oxenfree, it's a critical darling adventure game that came out in early 2016 and swept a ton of award shows. Now, it's back! The gist is that the sequel is set five years after the original, with a new protagonist (Riley).
While we wait for Pikmin 4 in a few weeks, the rest of the eShop is crawling along slowly. There are 24 additional games coming out this week, which sounds like a lot, but it's fairly low for the 30-40-on-the-regular storefront: which is becoming increasingly crowded.

If you haven't checked out one of 2023's best Xbox games, you're missing out. Hi-Fi Rush came out of nowhere and left a lot of people impressed by its slick, comic-style action, cartoony visuals, and rhythm mechanics. It represented something a little different, made even more special by the fact that it was developed by Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo studio Tango Gameworks.
Now, the latest update has arrived, which brings two new game modes which can be accessed by an arcade cabinet in the Hideout. For starters, you can now take on a challenge that really tests your reflexes. Known as BPM Rush, this mode lets you take on endless enemies with things getting faster and faster until you eventually hit 200 BPM. That should sort the wheat from the chaff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Pokémon-a-likes continue to pop up on PC, and I just found another really cute one hiding in the tall grass of Steam demos. Kādomon: Hyper Auto Battlers naturally has you collecting colourful creatures before you force them into an animal fight pit against other probably-not-enthusiastic participants. But this one mixes in some of Slay The Spire’s roguelike structure and the result has you compulsively resisting the "just one more game" urge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that we've all escaped the clutches of The Tartarus Key, it's time for another RPS Game Club pick! This month's game has been chosen by yours truly and I'm very much in the mood to revisit a comfy, cosy puzzle game so I've chosen Unpacking. Cue the confetti!
Unpacking is a puzzle game that's all about pulling your homewares and personal items out of cardboard moving boxes and placing them in a new home. It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.

A strange ritual, in which hundreds of editors across the world suddenly lose all the time we were sure we had to write features or reviews, like water sucked away before a tidal wave. "Ooh, that’s a cheap SSD," we all begin muttering in unison. "Maybe readers would like to know about this gaming keyboard deal," the chant grows. Weird stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has formally revealed the first fighter joining the Street Fighter 6 roster post-launch, and it's Rashid, a returning fighter who first appeared in Street Fighter 5. 
Rashid hits the game on July 24, so there are still a few weeks to go until he's playable. All owners of the game's Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, and Year 1 Character Pass can play as him. You can also play Rashid for up to one hour for free using a Rental Fighter ticket, which is obtainable in the in-game Fighting Pass. 
Check out the Street Fighter 6 Rashid gameplay trailer below for a look at what to expect: 


Rashid will be playable in all three of Street Fighter 6's modes: World Tour, where he'll be added to the story mode with unique moves for your custom avatar, the Fighting Ground as the 19th playable character; and the Battle Hub, where you can earn Rashid-related gear, emotes, and more. Moves to look out for include Arabian Cyclone, Arabian Skyhigh, Super Rashid Kick, Ysaar, and Altair.
Rashid hits Street Fighter 6 on July 24. He'll be joined by upcoming fighters like A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma this year. 
While waiting for Rashid to join the roster, read Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 review to find out why we love the game so much, and then check out this upcoming Street Fighter 6 collaboration coming to Exoprimal.

Yes, Nic Cage showed up to announce he’d soon be a playable character in horror multiplayer game Dead By Daylight. And now he is, starting today. 


Nic Cage plays himself, Nic Cage, a role that he’s mastered over the years.

8BitDo, the purveyor of fine third-party controllers, has revealed the design for their next controller. This one is more than just a slight nod to the Neo Geo CD’s legendary mash-up between arcade stick and joypad.
By “more than just a slight nod,” I mean it’s pretty much exact. In fact, the company themselves say it is “a perfect recreation of the original SNK NEOGEO controller.” That’s sort of inaccurate since they added shoulder and extra function buttons, but I think they’re referring more to the design of the stick. NEOGEO gamepads had a special digital stick that had a unique “click” to it as you hit all the directional inputs. This was first used with the NEOGEO CD console, but the click wheel would also make its way to the NEOGEO pocket.

I consider myself a pretty big fan of action-RPG games. Therefore, like many others, I have been cautiously optimistic about the longevity Diablo 4 can provide with its content releases. And right now, Season 1 of Diablo 4 has the potential to bring ARPG fans together, or drive them even further apart.
When D4 finally got announced, it didn't take long to start hearing two claims from ARPG fans. It was common to hear either "Diablo 4 will kill Path of Exile!" or "Diablo 4 won't have good enough content to compete with Path of Exile!". With over 100 hours in D4 so far, and almost 1,500 hours in PoE over the years, let me tell you: the two games can certainly co-exist in the ARPG genre. While both games are ARPGs, their end-game systems—and there…]]></summary>

By 2004, the Gamecube was running out of steam. Nintendo had come out swinging with their new console, but their fists had hit very little meat. A number of certifiable classics beloved to this day came out in its first few years, but the console still managed to lose further ground to its competitors. Still, that year we got some memorable titles like Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Pikmin 2, and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.
Of those games I just named, I only love one of them, and it’s not the one we’re talking about.
In preparation for Pikmin 4, Nintendo surprise-dropped HD versions of Pikmin 1 and 2. I’ve already covered their shiny new port of the first game, and now it’s time to delve into Pikmin 2. Delve deep down. Deep into i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the day of our interview, Exo Rally Championship programmer and composer Rhys Lindsay was preparing for a race on a hostile alien planet, and feeling pretty good about his chances. He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”


Of course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.

Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. 
And having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One recent Fallout: New Vegas mod adds a murderous psychic tumbleweed called Windy to your party, further cementing the game as the best in the series. ‘Wait a second, that doesn’t make any sense,’ you might be saying about a game where people don’t use bedsheets to sleep. But the mod is only accessible with the Wild Wasteland trait turned on, which allows all manner of silly and unrealistic things to happen in-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft have started to dish out two-week suspensions to players in Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 over an XP exploit. Players were apparently joining the game’s roguelike Descent mode partway through matches via a loophole in Ubisoft Connect’s interface. The team says the bug yielded an “unfair amount of XP and SHD levels,” hence the penalties.

Therefore, I thought I'd let you know about a great price for the entry-level Arctis Nova 3, a wired version of the headset that offers the same comfortable design at a lower weight and with support for a wide range of USB devices from PC and Steam Deck (via USB-A or USB-C) to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and more. 
It's currently on sale for $70 at Amazon US, a tidy 30% discount from its original US MSRP of $100 as part of an early Prime Day deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.


It would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.

Atlus describe her as a “mysterious revolutionary with a strong sense of justice,” although it’s not yet clear what we’re revolting against, aside from vaguely-French demons. Check out the new gameplay trailer.

Yesterday, the action-platformer sequel dropped a trailer showing off a lush jungle level that's strikingly similar to the original game’s opening environment, but this time things have been high-qualified with pretty sun rays, explosions, and dodge rolls aplenty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.
There, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep.

One autumnal evening, Sally gets lost and tries to take the old mining cable car back home - only to discover herself in a weird mirror version of her home town, derelict and abandoned save for shadowy monsters, the likes of which you'd find as models in Forbidden Planet in a cabinet labelled "From The Mind Of Tim Burton".

Each one loosely follows on from the games preceding them, even though they bury past art styles, perspectives, music, and ideas.

Doomblade is both metal and kind of cute, and it's held my interest longer than the average platformer or metroidy castley oh my god do we seriously not have a better word for this yet.
The main thing marking it out, apart from its style, is that instead of stabbing monsters, you attack by hovering the cursor (actually the shimmery face of the sword's spirit) over them and clicking, which launches your little globby shadow man directly at them. You can probably already imagine that this is also a means of getting around the world.

“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.
“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an uncomfortably humid night in the bustling Shinjuku ward of Tokyo, Japan. I futilely try to circulate air in my sweat-stained shirt at an intersection surrounded by questionable bars and seedy nightclubs. A comparatively innocent landmark grabs my attention: a batting center. It’s a delightfully familiar sight. But as I imagine its visitors enjoying a fun day swinging for the fences, author Jake Adelstein pops my thought bubble by telling me that the most horrific gang violence he ever witnessed unfolded on the corner we stand on: someone cracking another person’s skull open with a baseball bat.

Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, Activision, and Ubisoft routinely publish some of the biggest titles in the game industry. But it might surprise you to learn Netflix is trying to add its name to that list.
Open your Netflix app right now. Scroll past the big new releases, the recommended movies and TV shows, past the trending now section, and you’ll finally see it: Netflix Games, offering “no ads, extra fees or in-app purchases” and “unlimited access to exclusive games,” all included with the standard subscription. A few of these titles don’t have mobile versions elsewhere, yet they sit on Netflix’s mobile app. How did that happen? Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. 
The remake is currently in "its earliest stages," Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.


Black Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.

The Unreal Engine 5 edition has now slightly adjusted its price, changed plans for the remastered expansions, and is now launching into early access sometime this October, slipping past its previous late summer window. Those still playing the orignal Survival Evolved have a small reprise, though, as the game's planned shutdown has moved from August to September 30th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exoprimal is built using Capcom’s proprietary RE Engine, which is surprising considering the other Capcom games that have used the engine are quite different. The first game to publicly use it was Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, which caused many to dub the engine the Resident Evil engine, which is not what the ‘RE’ stands for. Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”

You get my point. The future, but via a second-hand retro clothes store full of dungarees and big print. I'd hesitate to say Return To Grace, a gentle adventure about exploring an ancient complex that houses a long-dormant god-like AI, entirely meets the strict definition of "retrofuturist", but it's definitely "space but the 60s", and it looks bloody lovely.

Apparently 10 years is the answer, since a remake of Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag (aka the best one) is reportedly in the early stages of development at Ubisoft, at least a0ccording to a report from Kotaku. If true, this means it's joining The Last Of Us Part 1 as 2013’s other maybe-too-soon remake.

The post includes a message from Valve saying that developers "own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create assets." Valve have now cleared up their thought process on the subject, saying they don’t want to discourage developers from experimenting with AI tech, though they need to make sure developers have “sufficient rights” before publishing anything on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, Canadian Gary Bowser was released from a U.S. prison, after serving a sentence for his role in infamous hacking group Team-Xecuter. How the 54-year-old computer geek ended up there is a remarkable story that began way back in the early '80s. After telling his story, Gary hopes to find support for new and legal endeavors, ideally with a geek twist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Homeworld and its sequel were real-time strategy games that stuck in the memory mainly due to the atmosphere they managed to create via dialogue, music choices and striking ship designs. I had mentally labelled coming sequel Homeworld 3 as "more of the same, but better looking", without thinking much more about it.

A new development update from developers Blackbird Interactive doesn't so much prove me wrong as go into great detail about what "better looking" really means - while also making me excited about the new "flavor layer" of ship-to-ship communication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a move I pull in most gunfights in Trepang2: slidekick into an enemy, grab them out of mid-air, briefly hold them in front of me as a human shield, only to pull the pin on their vest's grenade and hurl them into a group of their pals, who do try to scatter before this meaty bomb bursts but sadly forget that they also need to avoid me and my shotgun. Often this is all in slow-motion. Trepang2 is unashamedly aiming to be a new F.E.A.R. and does a pretty great job of it for a game made by a core team of only four people (plus external artists and such). Give me a shotgun, a slidekick, and slo-mo, and I'm happy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the most enigmatic and polarizing games when it crept to Xbox and PC last fall. Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.
Despite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. 
The PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay. Check out the game’s new trailer below.]]></summary>

The Pegasus Expedition is one of my favourite kinds of game. I'm not sure if it quite comes together enough, but it's trying something so original that even its partial success is worth celebrating. You're leading a 4X-ish effort to establish a power base in an unfamiliar galaxy. But you're not doing it to conquer everyone or win victory points. You're doing it so you can go back home and save Earth from annihilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good immersive sims are hard to beat. Almost nothing matches the feeling of creatively using all of your abilities to find a scrappy and sometimes unintentionally hilarious solution. Enter Mosa Lina, a pixel platformer that calls itself a “hostile interpretation of the immersive sim, where nothing is planned, and everything works.” Unpredictability is what the game prides itself on and “hostile” is definitely not an understatement based on the embedded developer tweet below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ruinarch is based on a concept many of you have thought of at some point. What if, instead of building up villages and hunting down hostile monsters and evil overlords, you were playing as the Dark Lord?
It's been done most famously in Dungeon Keeper or Overlord, but those were quite conventional structurally. Sure, you were playing as the baddies, but still doing mostly the same things as in other games, twirling your moustache the whole time. Ruinarch feels not like one of those thematic remixes of an established structure, but an attempt to build a new subgenre. Now that it's reached a full release, it also, sadly, feels like a demonstration of how difficult that really is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only had four TV channels growing up, and thus do not knowing anything about Bob L'éponge other than what is required to understand Tumblr posts (and that he lives in a tropical fruit). What I can tell you is that the SpongeBob Squarepants DLC for PowerWash Simulator confirms that PowerWash DLC is now the only way I will consume content about pop culture I do not understand. The most elaborate Spiderverse-themed skins for Fortnite, with all the custom dances they can muster, are as shadows and dust next to methodically cleaning an orange submarine car while a fictional octopus sends you sad texts. I'm convinced PowerWash Sim could do a crossover with literally any intellectual property and make it work. Lego. Mad Men. The filmography of Nicolas Cage. Clean them all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As some of you might be aware, I went to Japan earlier this year and had a great time. Off the back of the trip, I've finally decided to get my act together and pursue a long, arduous road to some degree of fluency. It's always going to be a work-in-progress, but I think I've settled into a language learning routine which leaves me with plenty of time for Love Island in the evening. DuoLingo's owl has been punted to the curb, too, because the bird is awful.
Naturally, I've turned to a textbook: Genki I. At first I thought there was no getting past it being a bit dry - I mean they aren't meant to be thrillers, are they? Until, that was, I discovered Game Gengo, a YouTuber who takes each lesson from the textbook, breaks them down into manageable chunks, all complete with loads of examples from video games. I spend most of my evenings with the guy, and what a treat it is.

The Xbox ANZ account tweeted an image of a noughts and crosses board that spelled out Psycho with three Xs. It was a rather confusing tease to say the least, and lo and behold, there was no Psychonauts 3 announcement during the showcase. Now Double Fine boss Tim Schafer has confirmed that he’s not working on it either.

In this smart murder mystery detective game from the creator of Ace Attorney, you play the recently deceased amnesiac Sissel as he attempts to piece together his own demise. Who killed him? And why? And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning. Thus begins a frantic night of whodunnit puzzling at its finest, with director Shu Takumi showing us exactly what he's made of outside the courtroom dramas he built his name on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight's Annapurna Interactive Showcase brought us 30 minutes of fresh game announcements, putting a lovely (and hopefully final) full stop on this year's notE3 / Summer Game Fest period. While most of the announcements were updates on games we already knew about, there are a couple of cool new things in there that I'm personally quite pumped for, including a new Blade Runner game being developed internally at Annapurna Interactive, a new Keita Takahashi joint about a kid stuck in a T-pose of all things, and a new ghostly biking game from the team behind Nidhogg. I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below.

In it, we get to see exactly how its adorable creature herding works in co-op, which you'd probably hope to see, given its own Steam page also describes it as a co-op multiplayer game. But rest assured, Flock is still very much a game you can play on your own, without the need to have a pal along for the ride, the devs tell me.

The reveal trailer doesn't give too much away at this stage, but I'm getting very big Her Story and Immortality vibes from it. Come and have a gander below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive, the publisher behind games like Stray and Neon White, held a showcase today to reveal new games, and updates for previously announced ones, shine the spotlight on new developers, and more. It even unveiled its first-ever first-party game. We have all that and more in our breakdown below. 
Here’s everything announced during the 2023 Annapurna Interactive Showcase
While the showcase featured plenty of updates about games we’re already excited about, it also featured four new game reveals.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/06/29/blade-runner-2033-labyrinth-is-annapurna-interactives-first-in-house-game"/>
        <updated>2023-06-29T19:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 
Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 
Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 
Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors will be released on PlayStation, Xbox (including Xbox Game Pass), Switch, and PC on November 2, it's been revealed. 
This news comes by way of today's Annapurna Interactive Showcase, where developer Outerloop Games released a new trailer showing off more of what to expect in this RPG that's one part a skateboarding game, another part a cooking game, and always a game about confronting your exes and parents. It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: 


As you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. 
Thirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2.

In the game, you control a small beetle-like creature as you traverse through a mysterious alien world using strange orbs that they themselves are worlds you can dive into. 
Check out Cocoon in action in the trailer below: 


As you can see, Cocoon continues to look great and now we know we don't have to wait too much longer to play it.

Among the new additions: car crashes, much improved pathfinding, and car parks. I find all of these as exciting as each other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.

        <id>120758</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/06/29/baldurs-gate-3-re-rolls-initiative-advancing-pc-release-date-but-delaying-ps5"/>
        <updated>2023-06-29T15:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.
"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st," the community update reads. "Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date."
Meanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, "This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it," likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.
The community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.

We now have our first in-game look at his new project Pioneers Of Pagonia, which seems to dial up the economic management and actual building-of-towns side of the formula, rather than the RTS combat machinations. Take a look at the lush fields and construction down below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Illusion Island is an upcoming “Mickeyvania” exclusive to Switch and after being revealed over a year ago, it’s finally out next month. Dlala Studios and Disney have released a new story trailer to prepare potential players for what’s in store on the island. 
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy mysteriously arrive on the island of Monoth and soon after find that its people need their help. This kickstarts their journey as players must platform through the various obstacles, challenges, and biomes of Monoth. Each character has the same abilities (although animated quite differently), so players can select whichever hero they want to save the day. 
Check out the latest Disney Illusion Island story trailer for yourself below: 


For more about Disney Illusion Island, watch the reveal trailer from last summer and then check out this gameplay trailer from February. After that, read about the game’s lack of combat and a Metroid-style map.
Disney Illusion Island hits Switch on July 28.

It’s a somewhat odd metric to parse out because copies shipped and sold aren’t the same. For example, a shipped copy might still be sitting on a game store shelf, while a digital copy sold is money made. Nonetheless, between physical shipped copies of FFXVI and digital versions purchased by players, Square Enix says it has reached 3 million copies sold.

Remakes and remasters are more common than ever in 2023. What's most interesting is seeing how these new versions handle the issue of completely rebuilding versus simply making modern visual improvements. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a remake of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life that straddles the line between these two philosophies fairly evenly but still delivers an outdated experience in various aspects.

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the ambitious follow-up to 2017’s Breath of the Wild, finally hit Switch last month. We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. 
What’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added.

That’s according to new internal emails revealed as part of Microsoft’s ongoing court trial against the Federal Trade Commission to acquire Activision Blizzard, as reported by The Verge. In a 2020 email, Xbox head Phil Spencer writes to Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood and CEO Satya Nadella to request a “Strategy Approval to approach Sega Sammy regarding a potential acquisition of their Sega gaming studios.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dear Villagers and developer Fallen Leaf Studios have released a new trailer on IGN for Fort Solis, the upcoming sci-fi horror game starring Roger Clark and Troy Baker. 
This trailer starts with Baker discussing how he came to be involved with Fort Solis and why he’s excited about the game before he reveals it hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. 
Fort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22.

        <updated>2023-06-26T16:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. 
This surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. 
"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone," a press release reads. "Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents." 
Unlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. 
Crema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. 
For more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between the Super Mario Bros. Movie and several announcements during last week's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo's mascot is having a great 2023. Carrying on the Mario momentum, Oreo announced a limited-edition cookie collab with the iconic Nintendo franchise.
The cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.
"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well," Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. "We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!"
You can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.


The Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

The confusion began yesterday, June 25, when Bethesda's support Twitter account tweeted that all physical versions of the upcoming game would include a code instead of a disc, a message that was later deleted without clarification. You can read all about that in the original version of this post below, but that same support account responded this afternoon with a link to a June 11 blog post detailing the release details and stating...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
