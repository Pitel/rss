        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mental Salvo describes itself as having an "infinite open world" in which you can do so many things, "they're impossible to list". Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

As if the unholy swarm of trailers and game announcements from Summer Game Fest was not enough, this week the fearful megalords at Valve decided to drop their regular cavalcade of coming-soons onto their megastore. The beautiful (and terrifying) thing about Next Fest, of course, is the overwhelming number of demos that come out during the event. A small herd of video games are standing on my toes as we speak. But that's okay, we are expert curators. Here's a handy list of our nine favourite demos of the lot.

It's got everything that makes the expansion's campaign so much fun to play through and forms a key part of it towards the end, but it's fairly complex the first time around. 


You'll first play through Liminality as a narrative story mission when experiencing The Final Shape's campaign. It's definitely not the meatiest mission in the story, but it has a few mechanics that will force you to think on your feet and some extremely pressured encounters you won't have seen before. I believe this is the best strike we've ever had in the game, but it certainly takes some getting used to it when you're initially exploring it.

To farm Sevagoth, you need to play the Void Storm missions that pop up in the Veil, Pluto, or Neptune Proximas in the Empyrean/Railjack missions. Once you have completed the Call of the Tempestarii quest, his blueprint will be given to you. The rest of his parts are from the aforementioned Void Storms.


What makes this difficult is that the Veil, Pluto, and Neptune Proxima regions tend to have higher-level enemies, annoying mechanics, and additional objectives to take care of.

Fields of Mistria is essentially Stardew Valley with added magical abilities and the bonus of being able to both jump and swim. You play as an adventurer who has answered the call for someone to come and help rebuild Mistria after an earthquake has cut it off from the outside world. 


As someone who has sunk many, many hours into Stardew, I cannot help but draw huge parallels between the two games. The pixel art style is obviously similar, as are the movement style, tools, and more. However, Fields of Mistria does offer a few things that Stardew …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op would be a blast from the past for many, but it's still a feature that's highly requested by players. Being able to team up for multiplayer matches or zombies sounds like a fantastic idea for a Friday night.


Will there be Call of Duty Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op?


Activision has provided a few details about Black Ops 6 through a short Q&A section on its support website. “Split-screen gameplay (two players sharing a screen) for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5," said Activision. "To ensure performance integrity, split-screen gameplay will not be supported on Xbox One or PlayStation 4.”


Black Ops 6 will have splitscreen co-op but there's a catch.


Unfortunately, the PS4 and Xbox One versions won't support Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op, at least from day one of its launch. 


It's great to see splitscreen co-op still being supported in 2024, and the Call of Duty series has a history of implementing the feature into its games. Last year's Modern Warfare 3 has it, for example.


Splitscreen shooters on PS4 and Xbox One


Now that Activision has sunset splitscreen functionality within its PS4 and Xbox One ports of Call of Duty games, you don't want that seat next to you completely empty. Thankfully, there are still some shooters you can play with a pal with split-screen on the older consoles. One example is the Borderlands series, including the most recent Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. You can hook up two controllers and get as much loot as you can gather together. 


Tiny Tina's Wonderlands has splitscreen co-op


If you're on the Xbox One, the Halo Master Chief Collection is a good way to go. You can play through the campaigns with a buddy, and you can wreck fools online as well with some split-screen action just like the old days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[European players of Final Fantasy XIV tend to fall by the wayside when it comes to exclusive rewards, but they’re finally getting one in the shape of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the game, complete with extra goodies, available now.


The set costs £17.99 GPB / €19.99 ‎ and comes with:



A special box, complete with 10th Anniversary meteor logo


Code for Final Fantasy XIV - Starter Edition


A mousepad, complete with Final Fantasy XIV meteor logo and Moogle design


A Code for 50 in-game Buttery Mogbiscuits, which increase EXP gain by 4% for 30 minutes when eaten and were previously only available as part of a promotional collaboration with Shoryu Ramen



Players who purchase this box can also receive 30 hours of free play time, although this only applies if you’ve never had an account registered in Final Fantasy XIV before. If you’re looking to drag a friend into Eorzea and would like these items, you could always purchase this for yourself and pass on the code. 


The code is not compatible with the Steam version of Final Fantasy XIV, so if you want to use it, you’ll need to download the official game client and play that way.

For those outside of the EU, don’t worry, there is an alternative 10th Anniversary item up for grabs. Players everywhere can get a 10th Anniversary playmat, which is "perfect for your next Final Fantasy XIV trading card game," or can otherwise be used as a mousepad. It measures 23 by 13 inches, so it’s not small, and will cost you $39.99 USD.

Getting a Refracting Prismatic Key in The Refraction is one of the most challenging. 


You'll find this puzzle while exploring The Refraction, most likely on your way to start the Dual Destiny Exotic Quest. It's in the crystal cave room that resembles the old Vanguard office, with a view overlooking the location where you find Ikora in Exegesis. The puzzle is a Prismatic Chest you can't open and a lock on a door you want to get through. You've got to remove the lock to open the chest, but it requires you to use a mechanic you have never used before in the game until this point.

Verity is the fourth encounter in the Salvation's Edge Raid, following Substratum, Dissipation, and Repository. While the first three encounters taught players how to generate Resonance via plates, the fourth encounter throws that all out for a more esoteric mechanic. Guardians' observation skills are put through the wringer, as the name of Verity's game is attention to detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Ops has been known to have some of the best Zombies modes, thanks to its highly entertaining maps. The sixth iteration will continue this tradition with an all-new undead challenge. Here's what you can expect in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Zombies mode.


What to expect in Black Ops 6 Zombies


Get ready to relive the nostalgia as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 brings back the classic round-based Zombies mode, a feature that was dearly missed in the latest MW3 Zombies. Prepare to face endless hordes of zombies, with each round escalating the challenge with more formidable foes.


Terminus and Liberty Falls are the two new round-based Zombies maps. We've seen a glimpse of some locations featuring a tropical-esque map in the trailer. 




As for the timeline, Black Ops 6 Zombies takes place sometime after Black Ops Cold War, continuing the Dark Aether narrative that has been a central theme in the previous games. It isn't clear if this will also involve Modern Warfare 3's Dark Aether Rifts, but this entry may not be a part of the BO universe.


Pack-a-Punch and power-ups will likely be available throughout the map. Specifically, the GobbleGums will make their epic return, currently available for purchase in the Vault Edition. These unique abilities, such as the Burned Out GobbleGum that makes zombies burst into fire, were a hit in Black Ops 3 and are sure to add a new dimension to your gameplay in Black Ops 6's Zombies mode.

Operator skins are also available to go along with the Zombies mode. This includes the Warden of Alcatraz skin, Brutus, and the Reborn skin, Klaus. These Operators can be equipped during the Black Ops 6 Open Beta, and you can check out our guide on this to see when it starts.


Like many Zombies entries, Easter Eggs can be found throughout the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies map. These hidden gems typically provide challenges to embark on as a solo player or with a team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mods are an integral part of unlocking the deeper aspects of Warframe's sandbox. While a lot of mods are stat boosts that heavily improve a particular aspect of your gear, others can completely change the way that gear functions or even improve the experience a ton. One such mod not only adds a new system for your melee weapon but also improves that system considerably. Here's how to get the Dreamer's Wrath mod in Warframe.


Where to get the Dreamer's Wrath mod in Warframe


Image via Digital Extremes.


The Dreamer's Wrath mod is acquired through the Alchemy mission type, found on the node Cambire on Deimos. If you don't have access to this mission yet, you'll need to progress the Warframe story until you've completed the Whispers in the Walls main quest. The quest unlocks the Alchemy mission type, along with several other Entrati Labs levels. 


Once you get into it, progress through the mission until you've completed four rotations (bringing the Conversion Process to 100% four times). This gives you a Rotation C reward, which offers a 6% chance to drop Dreamer's Wrath.


Alongside Dreamer's Wrath, Rotation C of this Alchemy mission provides the following rewards at the following chances:



1,200x Endo - 20%


Mandonel Receiver - 16%


Mandonel Stock - 16%


Condition's Perfect - 12%


Master's Edge - 12%


Opportunity's Reach - 12%


Discipline's Merit - 6%



Is the Dreamer's Wrath mod worth using?


Dreamer's Wrath is a melee mod that enables Tennokai, a system that improves Heavy Attacks when timed correctly. Compared to other Tennokai mods, this mod increases the chance to trigger a Tennokai attack by 50% and critical damage of these attacks by 32%. If you want to have Tennokai on your weapon, there aren't many mods better than Dreamer's Wrath. The immense improvements to the system make it a beast in your arsenal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since there isn't a distinct map to use in Type Soul, finding various items, like the Soul Ticket and Red Elixir, can be challenging. Another destination you may not be aware of is the game's Accessory Shop, which is reasonably hidden. Here's how to get accessories in Type Soul and what type of clothing you can expect.


Where to get accessories in Type Soul


The Accessory Shop in Type Soul is nestled in Karakura town, marked with a distinctive clothing hanger sign. To reach this area, use the Senkaimon ability to transport there or The Key if you're a Quincy. Even if you're a beginner, these techniques are within your grasp via the skills menu. Upon entering this town, you'll find yourself at a random location, so keep an eye out for a brick wall near the waterside.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Given that there are two brick walls in Karakura town, the correct one will have an outlook of some city buildings. You may need to go to the other side of the bridge to find it. Watch out for other players here, as this town is a primary spot for battles. 


Start looking toward the left side of the brick wall to spot the Accessory Shop's clothing hanger sign. It should be next to some white buildings. 





Go through the shop doors to speak to Nel Tu, who will provide a list of accessories to purchase in Type Soul. It will be divided into various categories, such as Arms, Back, and Leg. Here's a sneak peek into the clothing selection:



White Collar


SSR Cloak


Black Collar


Primera Fur Black


Primera Fur


Arrancar Cape


Arrancar Cape Black


White Belt


Black Belt


Earrings


Glasses


SSR Ropes


SSR Shoulderpad



Use the game's in-game currency to purchase these items. You can make money by completing quests in your Division and participating in raids.

A derelict hunk of spacecraft, left behind and abandoned, could be the key to the Cryo you need to stay ahead of your past. But right now, you’re staring at pips, bars, meters, and dice, all of which are telling you one thing: you might be screwed.


Because right now, you’ve got a die that could make or break this gig. You’ll either crack the last security measure needed to break through or start up some new calamity to deal with as the space hulk continues to tear apart in the vacuum. So, you push.

Monopoly GO Golden Blitz event schedule


The next Golden Blitz will arrive sometime between June 13 and June 19. Although the exact date is unknown, Scopely has confirmed that one more Golden Blitz event will occur before the Making Music album ends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's one thing Capcom fans haven't been quiet about over the years, it's their desire for a new entry in the Dino Crisis series. Capcom hasn't outright dashed these hopes either, and even included it as an option in a recent survey that covered a ton of burning questions. Naturally, fans delivered, choosing Dino Crisis as the title they'd most like to see get a sequel or new game.


Before we get into a breakdown of the results, let's poke that Dino Crisis bear again. Capcom's 1999 PlayStation slice of dinosaur horror garnered 80,769 votes to be named the "Capcom game series that you would like to see get a sequel or a new game." Mega Man came in second, and Devil May Cry came in third.

Square dropped the news earlier today along with a nearly four-minute launch trailer showcasing characters, enemies, and the game's gorgeous world. There do seem to be some hints at plot turns in the trailer, so you may want to avoid it if you want to be unspoiled. Granted, what's being revealed appears to be rather light. 




The series returns in August

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus has announced via its Japanese site that they are dropping veteran voice actor Toru Furuya from the cast of Metaphor: ReFantazio. While the statement only says that they’re dropping the actor for “various reasons,” it most likely has to do with reporting by Shūkan Bunshun that alleged the actor had a four-and-a-half year affair with a much younger fan.


Toru Furuya posted a message on Twitter back in May to apologize to fans. In his statement, he confirmed the affair with the fan, who was reportedly 37 years younger than him, as well as the fact that he, at one point, struck her. He also reportedly coerced the woman into getting an abortion after she became pregnant.


Following the reporting, many companies chose to distance from the actor, with the Showroom streaming service dropping his program and his appearance at Momocon 2024 being canceled.


Toru Furuya is a prolific voice actor, with roles going back to the ‘60s. He’s lent his voice to characters such as Yamcha from Dragon Ball, Amuro Ray in Mobile Suit Gundam, and Tuxedo Mask in Sailor Moon. He also, for a time, voiced Mario in the anime movie Super Mario Bros: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!, as well as various commercials.


Atlus has stated that they’ll announce who is filling the role in July. Metaphor: ReFantazio is slated to be released on October 11, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aksys Games has announced that the next installment of their Fitness Boxing series is coming West this Fall. Previously announced for Japan, Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku is a version of Fitness Boxing that features Hatsune Miku, if that wasn’t clear.


If you’re unfamiliar, Fitness Boxing is an alleged exercise game where you perform various boxing punches in time to pop music instrumentals. If you’re unfamiliar with Hatsune Miku, she’s a Vocaloid voicebank that broke free from her software prison to become a full-fledged pop star. If you’re unfamiliar with Vocaloid, it’s a voice synthesizer so you can experience what it’s like to control a computerized voice before they control us.




It’s not a terribly weird mix when you consider that Hatsune Miku is a music… thing and Fitness Boxing is a rhythm game. However, she’s not what I think of when I think about fitness or boxing. We last saw Fitness Boxing: Fist of the North Star, and while that’s a license that isn’t focused on boxing, it is at least fighting-adjacent. Punches are often thrown.


Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku will set you up to train with Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len, and Megurine Luka, with Lin and Evan from the core Fitness Boxing series joining as instructors. I don’t know who any of these people are. It will feature 24 songs from Piapro, along with "Melt" and "The Vampire” which I’m guessing are popular.


I don’t have much familiarity with Hatsune Miku. I was considering getting Fitness Boxing 2, since I recently started taking Muay Thai kickboxing lessons. Not that I think it will help, but it might at least be fun exercise that aligns somewhat with my new interest.


Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku has a vague release date of Fall for the West on Switch. It’s already out in Japan and is supposed to come out in the rest of Asia on July 12.

If you’re not deeply immersed in geek or Japanese culture, the word might not be familiar to you. It is a category of comic books used to denote that it is stylistically Japanese. While some would argue that only comics that originate from Japan qualify as manga, it has been applied to some works created outside the country but made in a similar style.


As writer Dan Nyugen found and compiled on Twitter, some Wordle fans were incensed by the inclusion of the word. “I never heard of this word and is not well known English language,” strained one user.

When I was growing up, there wasn't much YA sci-fi on offer, so when I wanted to branch out from fantasy books into sci-fi, I had to read some pretty advanced novels that were aimed at adults, like Jurassic Park or even The Invincible. These days, though, the genre is so much more accessible to its growing audience, which is why I've showcased a few of the best books for YA readers here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to EpicDB.
Those who are well-versed in Steam will likely be familiar with SteamDB. This publicly-available, unofficial database provides all sorts of figures and information about the games available in the storefront and now, a similar tool for Epic Games exists.
At least, it existed. The newly established EpicDB (which is now offline) was intended to provide all the same information for titles on the Epic Games Store but it looks like a little too much information was put on display. Within hours of going live, users were seemingly able to see codenames and titles for a multitude of unannounced projects from publishers including SEGA, Ubisoft, Saber Interactive and many more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another HEE-HOme Run.
It’s been nearly three years now since the launch of the original Shin Megami Tensei V and as is tradition at Atlus, the obligatory enhanced re-release (complete with a new storyline centered around a new girl) has now come to all modern platforms in the form of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. Boasting a full-length, alternate storyline and a host of gameplay and balance adjustments, SMTV: V is easily the definitive version of an already excellent entry in the long-running series. If you’re at all a fan of SMT, Persona, or JRPGs in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this up at the earliest opportunity.
For this review, we’ll be focusing more on the additions and adjustments being made to the core SMT V experience with this release—if you’d like to get a more detailed evaluation of the underlying gameplay mechanics and such, we’d encourage you to read through our review of the 2021 version, which still largely applies here, as well.

Despite being a flagship franchise, Atlus has never shied away from taking risks and experimenting with Shin Megami Tensei. Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole. It only makes sense that in revisiting such a r…]]></summary>

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.” 
That sentiment was shared by Graham Parkes, who wrote Before Your Eyes and now serves as creative director and writer at Nice Dream. He a…]]></summary>

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing.

In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enis has announced that Visions of Mana launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. 
For more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.

Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year's Madden NFL 24 here.

Blumhouse Productions exploded onto the scene in 2009 as a big deal in the horror film world. The studio had been around since 2002, but Paranormal Activity put it on the map.

So when the movie studio announced a video game division in late 2023, we were pretty excited. We didn’t get a peep from Blumhouse Games until Summer Game Fest 2024, but the wait was definitely worth it. And the highlight for us? Fear the Spotlight, which is coming to Switch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.


Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”
You can watch the first teaser for Arcane Season 2 here. For more on League of Legends, check out our in-depth preview of 2XKO, the franchise's upcoming fighting game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Par-fect.
Believe it or not, Mario Golf for the N64 is now 25 years old following its Japanese release on 11th June 2024. 25 years! A quarter of a century! We need to sit down...
The game has received multiple re-releases since on the Wii, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, so if you're a paying member of the higher tier on Switch, you can give it a go right now. It stood as the first Nintendo golf game to feature Mario in the title, but went on to spawn multiple sequels, including Toadstool Tour, World Tour, and of course, Super Rush.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game's action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook's journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what's to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer's next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game's main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a Trackmania player has finally beaten the racing game's most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that "addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game," but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.
A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, everybody! Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.]]></summary>

Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed has been threatening to go to Japan for so long that I think the idea has lost its thunder, but I’ll admit to a squee of enthusiasm, during our first look at Assassin’s Creed Shadows, when deuteragonist Naoe grappled onto the ceiling to allow a castle guard to pass innocently beneath. I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When your entire franchise revolves around sneaky assassins lurking in the shadows and running up buildings, it's no surprise fans of the series have been clamoring for a ninja-themed protagonist for years. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.


It opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention. As if his ornate armor wasn't enough to set him apart, Yasuke is a huge person, and people in the street stare as he walks by. The developers ex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Divine Trials" DLC is now available to all players for free, and it brings with it revisited boss fights, puzzle and platforming challenges, new amulets and outfits, and more. Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 
Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 
Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below: 


Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown hit PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC back in January, and it's one of our favorite games of the year. Read why in Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here. After that, check out these four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the Metroidvania genre right, and then watch our guide on how to beat the game's hardest platforming challenge.

The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. 
The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. 


If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. 


Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about it by visiting our cover story hub.]]></summary>

Metal Slug made its name as a fast-paced, run-and-gun explosive arcade shooter, making it all the more surprising how well it seemingly fits into a slower, turn-based strategy format. Since Metal Slug Tactics’ reveal at the final E3 in 2021, both series fans and tactics aficionados have been waiting with bated breath to get their hands on it. I count myself among them and was anxious to play a preview build to finally see how well this marriage of genres blends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number. 
Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is "33" and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these "Expeditioners" are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.


The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and sports slick-looking turn-based action. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is coming in 2025 to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including launching day one on Game Pass), and PC.]]></summary>

With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.
Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.

It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rumours of a new Gears of War appearing at today’s Xbox Games Showcase were accurate - well, mostly. The next Gears of War won’t be a sequel like Gears of War 6, but instead looks to be a prequel to the entire series that returns to the very beginning of the bloody battle between humanity and the alien Locust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, we received an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the latest entry in Treyarch's popular, long-running subseries to one of gaming's biggest franchises. As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps. To learn more about the upcoming title, read our in-depth preview here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 
In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 
Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 


"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."
Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 
There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

The Call of Duty franchise has undergone various transformations since its departure from the World War II setting. From modern and near-future settings to distant-future adventures in space, the franchise has explored the reaches of theoretical conflicts. However, the series may well be at its best when focusing on historical time periods and events, as has largely been the case with Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series. This subseries, which debuted in 2010, focuses on historical time periods and conspiracies surrounding them, creating narratives ripe with intri…]]></summary>

She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-lost reboot of Perfect Dark made its grand return during today's Xbox Games Showcase. First announced in 2020 at The Game Awards, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic. 
The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.


Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. It is coming to Xbox Series X/S, but it still has no release window.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have published the very first trailer for EA and BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, formerly known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, at their summer Xbox Game Showcase. It accompanies the first details of this "immersive single player RPG" - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - "where you become the leader others believe in". Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Showcase gave us a new look at Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, an action/role-playing game all about taking down a host of ancient gods. The game is in its final days of development from A44 Games, the same studio that released Ashen.
The trailer shows off the action in an open world that recalls titles like God of War and Elden Ring. The team has previously said that the action draws at least some inspiration from Soulslike games.
With today’s announcement, we know we won’t have long to wait until the game is available to try for ourselves, with a release date of July 18 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
Check out the new release date announcement trailer below for a glimpse of the action.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-06-09T17:45:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fable will launch sometime next year, developer Playground Games has revealed. It did so during today's Xbox Games Showcase with a new trailer that features quick snippets of gameplay starring our heroine. 
In the trailer, we see our hero waltzing through a large medieval town while a narrator discusses an old threat returning to the world. Our hero wants to save Albion, and to do so, she needs to enlist the help of Humphry, who is the one narrarating the trailer. 
While there appears to be gameplay in the trailer, there's no U.I. and no combat – it's mostly just our hero protagonist walking and running through various fantastical locations. We do see some glimpses of combat, but it looks cinematic so it's hard to tell if it's actual combat gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself in the Fable gameplay trailer below: 


"What does it mean to be a hero," the trailer's description reads. "Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion's very existence." 
Microsoft revealed Fable was coming back in 2020, with a reveal trailer from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. We then got our next look at the game with a more narrative-focused trailer starring Richard Ayoade last year, and today's new trailer is our first look at the game since then. 
Fable launches on Xbox Series X/S (and presumably PC) in 2025.

My main takeaway? That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they're on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

Other details, like whether series creator Hideo Kojima is involved in any way (unlikely) and a release date, are still unknown. But we're still excited to commence the virtuous mission again, hopefully soon.]]></summary>

I reviewed State Of Decay the first and thought it was a cool scrappy underdog next to larger zombie-botherers such as Left 4 Dead or DayZ. State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.
The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox has revealed Doom: The Dark Ages, the third installment in developer id Software's modern Doom reboot. And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. 
Fret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. 
Check it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: 


As you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. 
Id Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. 
Interestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well.

After the trailer, Microsoft Gaming CEO reiterated that Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one later this year, although no release date was revealed. The game will also come to PlayStation as well. Spencer said this Black Ops 6 trailer is the first time a Call of Duty game has appeared in an Xbox showcase in 10 years, and that going forward, all players (across all platforms) will experience the game, betas, seasonal expansions and updates, and more at the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Battle Chef Brigade developer Trinket Studios has unveiled its next project, Battle Suit Aces. Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.
Revealed during the Future of Play Direct players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.


The game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a "star-consuming threat." 
Battle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date. You can read our review of Battle Chef Brigade here.]]></summary>

Both the hero shooter genre and mainstream Marvel media are currently in interesting places. Overwatch, the most prominent hero shooter of last decade, has experienced a sharp downtown since the late 2019 announcement of its sequel, while the Marvel Cinematic Universe, once a surefire cash cow, has seen a wider range of results since its 2019 culmination with Avengers: Endgame. Marvel Rivals exists at the intersection of these two categories, and my hands-on session gave me hope that it will be able to capture the magic of both of these genre's glory days.

Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, "yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run." So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:51:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A goat or a lamb - which makes the better sacrifice? Trick question, it's neither. The best sacrifices are old rich people. In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.

Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle. It is called the Hexahedron, and its interior constitutes a “large, continuous puzzle cluster” that the player will navigate. As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

Ah, to return to a simpler time, where kids tripped each other up in the school hallways to steal toys , before Pokémon cards came along and everyone leveled up to stabbings. Sorry, Petal Runner devs, for opening a news article about your lovely wholesome game talking about stabbings. This gorgeous, fuschia-splashed, slice-of-life RPG is, if anything, the antidote to stabbings. In terms of game fatigue, anyway. It won’t cure tetanus, at least I don’t think so.

Then Wanderstop started to get rather bleak, and I finally stopped pinching myself. See for yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grid-based puzzler Grindstone was a favourite of Katharine’s, who found it to be her go-to during regularly scheduled moments of “cat-based paralysis”. I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.

The ‘next-gen’ part probably refers to Unreal Engine 5, and fair’s fair, it’s a real looker this one. The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

It’ll hit early access this summer, courtesy of a fresh look from tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its no-holds-barred 'dynamic+' injunctions, capable of blocking sites perpetually and forcing domain seizures in the U.S., India's emergence as a global copyright enforcer is remarkable. Yet, when the major Hollywood studios teamed up with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, to obtain a strict, immediate injunction against a site considered a global piracy threat, early non-compliance wasn't harshly punished. Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether or not they actually amount to anything, rumours of a new Doom have had me diving back into Doom Eternal recently. There’s at least one level in it that feels like essay-bait, so I’m obliging. The centerpiece of Mars Core - the FPS’  best level - is a comically massive superweapon called the BFG-10000. Oh, Chekov. If only you could see what we’ve done with your wisdom. The literary subtlety to gun-big-enough-to-scar-planets pipeline will eventually subsume all of pop culture, and those of us who chose to specialise writing about headshots will alternate between grins and tears from the wreckage.

So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.

It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.

While most forks are now disabled, the main repository has managed to survive after being given the opportunity to put things right.
