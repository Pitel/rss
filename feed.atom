We haven't heard a ton about Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed lately, but the new slime-shooting, trap-laying multiplayer game will be released on October 18, 2022.
Pre-orders are opening up at retailers like Amazon — how much is it? $40 for the standard edition on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, and $70 for the collector's. The game will launch on the Epic Games Store for PC, and it will also be playable on PS4 and Xbox One.
In case you missed it, this is the latest asymmetric multiplayer title from IllFonic, the folks behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Predator: Hunting Grounds (which is back in the spotlight, if only for a bit, thanks to the new curiosity-grabbing movie Prey).

Last week, we got a massive info-dump on the next entry in Nintendo's squid-shooter, Splatoon 3. It was a ton, ranging from a new hub and idol group to lockers, practice mode, and a catalog system. It was exciting, and because of that, I thought it might be time to return to its predecessor.
So I re-downloaded Splatoon 2, booted it up, and ventured out into the plaza. And within minutes I was reminded that yes, Splatoon is still quite good.
Walls of artwork, everywhere
One thing I immediately wanted to check in on was the latest in public plaza art. Splatoon 2 let players draw and set messages for their characters, kind of like a mixture of statuses and forum signatures, that other people could see in-game.

Of all the Marvel heroes, Iron Man has to be one of the most well-loved, thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark. There have been a few Iron Man games over the years, including a 2008 release from SEGA in conjunction with the film (and a sequel in 2010), as well as a well-received VR game in 2020. Even with those titles, it still feels like Iron Man needs a big, bombastic game a la Insomniac's Spider-Man. Well, the dream of an open-world Iron Man game almost became reality, according to a MinnMax interview with Christofer Sundberg, founder of Avalanche Studios (who are best known for the Just Cause series).

MinnMax's Ben Hanson interviewed Christofer Sundberg, co-founder of Avalance, who has since left the studio to start a new company, Liquid Sword. During the interview, Hansen asked Sundberg about the fate of the Iron Man project, which Sundberg revealed as being in development for a year and a half to two years before being canceled due to what he describes as "company politics."


Sundberg reveals that Disney wanted Avalanche to rapidly expand its staff to finish the game under a shortened development timeline. However, he refused, explaining that doing so would have put a massive strain on the studio.

As soon as I heard that the escape-room puzzle adventure game Escape Academy had split-screen co-op, I was in. And even as someone who's not exactly "into" real-world escape rooms, it ended up being a fun, not-too-frustrating time with memorable scenarios like a room with rising water, or a scramble to find an antidote after being poisoned. I'd recommend Escape Academy — particularly after today's update, which includes FOV options and a much-needed change to avoid accidental hints.
If you're just here for the field-of-view slider, you can now crank the FOV from 60 all the way up to 120. That also goes for the console versions of Escape Academy — I tested it out on my PlayStation 5 copy this morning. I'll probably settle somewhere in the middle. You…]]></summary>

It's a Kirbapalooza this week, as the gorgeous Kirby's Dream Buffet — which is sort of Mario Party, sort of Fall Guys, sort of Monkey Ball, and very Kirby — sees its global release on Nintendo Switch, kicking off another ripple of Kirby celebrations for the pink puffball's 30th anniversary.
Alongside the Kirby Café in Japan launching a new Dream Buffet dessert, Kirby and the Forgotten Land will also be offering a new Present Code from today until the 17th September.

Gamescom Opening Night Live is less than a week away, which means we're steadily seeing which games are pre-announcing their show appearance. Today, showrunner Geoff Keighley and Telltale Games confirm that the latter's The Expanse series will show off a first look at gameplay during the showcase.
The Opening Night Live stream is airing on Twitch and YouTube, on August 23 at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT. The show's expected to run for two hours, with over 30 games on stage to show.

KeokeN Interactive has shared the news that its epic sci-fi adventure Deliver Us Mars will no longer meet its previously expected September 2022 release date. Speaking on Twitter, the Dutch studio rescheduled the launch of its passion project to February 2, 2023, when it will finally arrive on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
"It is important to us that this experience is the best it can be at launch. With this in mind, we’ve collectively made the difficult decision to move the release date to February 2, 2023 in order to ensure that we are able to live up to that ambition," wrote KeokeN in yesterday's statement.
"Whilst we understand this news might be disappointing, we are excited for you all to face the challenges of Mars, traverse its hostile environments, and discover the mystery of the ARKS. Your patience will allow us to deliver the best experience we can."
Those looking forward to the ethereal jaunt to The Red Planet can at least take heart in the additional news that a brand new trailer is set to premiere during the Future Games Show, which is scheduled for August 24 as part of next week's Gamescom festivities. While the last-minute delay is unfortunate, the acclaim afforded 2018 predecessor Deliver Us The Moon suggests that KeokeN will have something special to offer interstellar explorers come launch day.
Deliver Us Mars launches February 2 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store).

London last hosted a Pokémon Center in 2019, producing a similar result of queues around the block; however, the attention gained by the World Championships had us suspecting that a firmer level of organisation would be in place this time around.

thatgamecompany's dramatic and evocative adventure Sky: Children of the Light is now getting set to enchant a whole new community of players, following the news that a PlayStation port is currently in the works.
Originally released on mobile platforms back in 2019, with a Nintendo Switch port following in 2021, Sky: Children of the Light is a fantasy open-world adventure with a heavy emphasis on social connection and cooperative interaction. Players explore a large, abstract kingdom made up of multiple realms. Through engagement with other players and various spirits, the player evolves their flight ability, slowly allowing them to progress further and further beyond the borders of the hub world, "Home."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBQRCHusYyU
Much like thatgamecompany's award-winning titles Journey and Flower, Sky: Children of the Light eschews combat and heavy antagonism in favor of exploration, mystery, and puzzle-solving. A slant on cosmetic items allows players to trade the in-game currency, candles, for various customization items including emotes, accessories, and musical instruments. Sky is currently engaged in its 14th season, with thatgamecompany continuing to build upon the universe it has created with additional lore, characters, and activities.
In a brief statement, the developer expressed its excitement and desire to "extend the circle of light even further" with the new PlayStation port. Though no further details nor a release window were announced, it was noted that the port will feature full crossplay functionality with the Switch and mobile editions. Fans should keep a watchful eye on the official Sky social media channels for more info.

The June release of Dotemu and Tribute Games' excellent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge fired up our passion for the heroes in a half-shell in a way we haven't felt for a long time. With the upcoming release of Konami's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection — and with news that port wizards Digital Eclipse are at the helm of this compilation of classics — we're getting ready to drown in another wave of excitement and nostalgia come 30th August.
With so many Turtles games having come to Nintendo consoles over the years (which Stuart Gipp dutifully chronicled for us), it's tough to know exactly where to begin, especially if — shocker! — you weren't even born when the first TMNT titles many of us glued to our TV sets and arguing passionately over the relative merits of one Ninja Turtle (or Hero Turtle in the UK) over the other.

Genda GiGO Entertainment is preparing to roll down the shutters on another Tokyo arcade center. On September 25, at the close of business, the GiGO Akihabara Arcade Building 4, will wish its final players a fond farewell.
As is the case with many of Japan's dwindling arcade centers, the GiGO center has reached the end of its current lease with the building owners, with GiGO choosing to close down the arcade rather than renew its contract. Any of Center 4's remaining roles, such as its hosting of the Ichiban Kuji lottery, will instead be relocated to Arcade Center 5, which is located in the northern Akihabara district. (Thanks to PR Times for the statement and Siliconera for the translation.)

The GiGO arcade centers — all of which bore the Sega name until the start of 2022 — have stood as some of the longest-running and most iconic arcade centers in Tokyo. Back in 2020, Sega closed what was considered the most popular of its arcades, Sega Building 2, after a 17-year occupation. This was followed by the closure (and ultimately, relocation) of Sega's 28-year-old Ikebukuro arcade center.
Since then, the continuing consolidation and/or closure of Sega/GiGO's arcade centers seems an unfortunate inevitability. As of September 26, Akihabara will play host to three remaining GiGO centers.

Right now it's slated to be released in demo form at the end of August or the beginning of September, but the crew is looking for folks to contribute in multiple arenas, including texture art and mission scripters. You can see how it's progressing below.
The Hit & Run universe is making a comeback thanks to fans
Not only is this project on the horizon, but someone is also taking it upon themselves to remaster Simpsons: Hit & Run, with custom cutscene animations, no less! For years, various folks who have been involved with the original Simpsons game have talked in whispers about bringing the series back to some degree, but often speak of the pile of rights issues they'd have to wade through.
Perhaps the popularity of these fan creations could grease the wheels a bit.

We're all pretty happy to have more Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to play, right? Over the past few months, we've got two brand new waves of courses thanks to the Booster Course Pass, which kicked off with Wave 1 in March and just recently followed up with Wave 2 earlier this month. But if there's been one common complaint among fans, it's to do with how the courses look compared to the base game.
Digital Foundry has now shared its thoughts on the 16 new tracks that we currently have access to, comparing them to both the main game's 48 courses and their Mario Kart Tour originals. So far, all of the Booster Course Pass additions have either been available in Mario Kart Tour or added at a later date (Sky-High Sundae), and this is what Digital Foundry thinks is "the heart of the issue".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another one bites the dust. If you haven't noticed, a number of high-profile delays have occurred in recent weeks, with many upcoming games pushed into next year. Unfortunately, the promising sci-fi platformer Planet of Lana joins that growing hit list.
Planet of Lana was first announced at E3 2021 with a 2022 launch window. The game stars Lana, a young girl, and her adorable cat-like companion Mui on a combat-free mission to preserve a serene planet occupied by robots and other creatures from corruption. Developer Wishfully Studios wants this cinematic puzzle platformer to make a big splash, announcing it’s pushing the release to spring 2023 to do so. 
Planet of Lana will be playable at Gamescom next week, so attendees have the opportunity to see how the game is shaping up first-hand. The title is slated to launch on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.
If you're losing track of every big game to slip into 2023, this handy list should serve as a nice reminder.]]></summary>

I wasn’t sure what to expect with We Are OFK. Based on the trailer, I thought it was going to be the usual fare we get with episodic, choice-based narratives (which I love). When I started playing, I was surprised to find that We Are OFK is less of a game and more of an animated miniseries with interactive elements, including music videos. It made a lot more sense that it was recommended to me to play on “whatever [my] preferred TV watching setup is.” We Are OFK is also considered a biopic by its creators, and while I'd more categorize it as a memoir, the point is that the project is a fictional telling of the forming of a real virtual band, which sounds more confusing than it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.
We Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.

At the end of every classic Kaiju film, the titular plods back into the sea, safe in the knowledge that their foe is vanquished. They return to their underwater homes, pour themselves a coffee and watch their day's highlights on TV. It's not a bad day's work; but they are alone, stuck in a cycle of people asking "where is the monster?" and never "how is the monster?" Without local bars, mutual friends, community events or even Tinder, the kaiju dating scene is a tough world. If only there was some way that we mortal humans could help...
We imagine that a thought process similar to this went through the minds of Squiddershins when it was deciding on the topic for its latest game. The product of that process is Kaichu: The Kaiju Dating Sim, a game which encourages those tired of the dating race in the real world to imagine how tough it would be if they were 300 feet tall.

The Switch practically begs for custom storage solutions given how unique the hardware is (and its software carts!), and there's plenty available. But these mini Nintendo Switch game cases, found by Rakueru on Twitter, are something else.
If you recall, some folks came up with homebrew creations roughly four years ago, but weren't selling them directly. So these are actually from the Etsy seller Kustom3DGermany, but they're currently sold out, so make sure you favorite the store if you want them.
Here's the full list of games that you can get mini Switch game cases for:
Animal Crossing
Crash Bandicoot
Diablo
Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze
Doom
Final Fantasy VII
Final Fantasy X|X-2
Final Fantasy IX
Lego City Undercover
Luigi's Mansion 3
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
Paper Mario Origami King
Pokemon Let's GO! Eevee
Pokemon Let's GO! Pikachu
Pokemon Shield
Pokemon Sword
Resident Evil Revelations Collection
Splatoon 2

Super Mario Odyssey
Super Mario Party
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening
Sonic Team Racing
Fire Emblem Warriors
Sid Meier's Civilization VI
Megaman 11
Yoshi's Crafted World
Note that for some people, the "similar items on Etsy" listings below the aforementioned link have very strange recommendations that might be NSFW. You've been warned!
They also make mini 3DS cases if you're interested, as well as Switch mini case holders.

The Summer Game Fest Twitter account revealed that ONL will feature world premieres for Sonic Frontiers, Hogwarts Legacy, The Callisto Protocol, and Return to Monkey Island. That usually means we’ll get new trailers for each game, whether they be gameplay, story, or both. Of course, other titles will be shown as well including Dying Light 2’s Bloody Ties DLC and Telltale Games' The Expanse. 
Next Tuesday, @geoffkeighley hosts @gamescom Opening Night Live from Germany.

Return to Monkey Island, also slated to launch this year, may get a firm release date as well.

Koei Tecmo has proudly announced that its hack 'n' slash epic Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has passed one million sales and shipments since its launch on Nintendo Switch back in June.
A joint production of Koei Tecmo, Nintendo, and developer Omega Force, Three Hopes sees new hero Shez brought under the wing of the Garreg Mach Monastery. Choosing tutelage under the banner of one of Fire Emblem's "Three Houses" — The Black Eagles, The Golden Deer, or The Blue Lions — Shez and their newfound allies against the might of the Empire. Three Hopes, as the name denotes, offers three distinct but interconnected tales depending on the player's school of choice.

Once out on the battlefield, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes features the typical hack 'n' slash action that one would associate with Koei Tecmo's Warriors titles. Considered a major improvement on 2017's Fire Emblem Warriors, Three Hopes has won acclaim from both critics and the Fire Emblem fan community for its wide roster of playable characters and engaging combat, though it has also been criticized for its repetition and lack of technical growth over its Warriors brethren. For the most part, however, Three Hopes is considered a success, and an absolute must-play for Fire Emblem fans.
Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is available now on Nintendo Switch.

The game was previously released on PC, PS4, and PS5 in March, 2022.
In ANNO: Mutationem, players are cast as Ann Flores, a highly-skilled combat extraordinaire who's on a personal mission to kick ass and take names in order to find her brother. She's accompanied by equally-talented hacker side-kick Ayane, who will help her to hone her skills, unravel conspiracies, and interrogate cyborg corgis (among other witnesses and suspects, of course).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn't involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE's story would come later, in the 2014 Director's Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games' puzzler a bit more, well, shape.
Even with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director's Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I'm telling you: please don't write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2: Stay Human was released earlier this year and since then, the team has continued to pump new content into the expansive parkour RPG. However, that content so far has been related to cosmetics, in-game parkour races, or other gameplay mechanics. Techland has yet to release anything new that pushes the story of Dying Light 2 forward. 
That could change soon as Dying Light 2's first story DLC, Bloody Ties, will get the full worldwide premiere treatment at Gamescom's Opening Night Live, which is hosted by Geoff Keighley and airs August 23. To tide fans over until then, the studio has released a teaser trailer that you can watch below: 


"What dangers await?" a press release reads. "How can you beat them? What will you get in return? One thing is certain...it will be brutal." 
As you can see, the DLC seems to hint at a brutal faction within the City, perhaps one interested in gladiator-style arena combat. Only time will tell what Bloody Ties entails, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. 
For more, read Game Informer's Dying Light 2 review and then read our interview about the future of Dying Light 2.

We're all sad about the death of Miiverse, and even Splatoon 3's attempt to sort-of bring it back won't soothe the pain of not being able to sample the delights of one-bit art from across the world. But One Night Stand developer Kinmoku announced today that their next game, Videoverse, is directly inspired by Miiverse — and now we just hope that, unlike actual Miiverse, it will come to the Switch.
Videoverse is set in the days of the early internet, and anyone who remembers old-timey technology like Teletext, MSN Messenger, and the chaotic '90s internet that was pastiched in Hypnospace Outlaw will find themselves catapulted into Nostalgia Town by the game's design:

Genshin Impact wrapped this business model up in a surprisingly excellent open world RPG, that Graham called one of the best games of 2020. Tower Of Fantasy pulls from a neighbouring gacha vending machine, except that its mixture of MMO, realtime combat, and lootboxing isn't wrapped up in as consistent a package.

But the update also adds a new SteamVR Home setting that – and I quote, with emphasis Valve’s - "showcases CT scans of actual dead bugs we found lying on the ground outside our office." See?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding is one of 2019’s best games (in my personal opinion), and it’s one I hope everyone gets the chance to try. Sure, you might not like it, but if it hits, it hits hard. 
PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 players know that, as the game was PlayStation exclusive at launch. It hit PC in 2020, but you had to buy it outright like any other PC game. Now, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass members might get the chance to try this Norman Reedus-led adventure across America with their subscription if a new, somewhat cryptic tweet from the official PC Game Pass account is anything to go by. 
Check it out for yourself below: 
sometimes we just like a good landscape picture #NewProfilePic
August 16, 2022
As you can see, PC Game Pass draws attention to the fact that it’s changed its profile pic to that of a familiar landscape. If you look at the profile pic, you’ll see what appears to be a landscape shot from Death Stranding. Now, it could be a different game but like, come on, that’s Death Stranding, right? 
All of this is to say that it seems like a formerly PlayStation-exclusive game – mind you, one developed by independent studio Kojima Productions that was funded by Sony Interactive Entertainment – is coming to PC Game Pass, a subscription service that’s a part of the Xbox ecosystem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That horizontal Switch dock setup has everyone asking questions
Masahiro Sakurai isn't doing Smash Ultimate DLC streams at the moment or working on another entry (that we know of), but he's still taking to Twitter constantly to talk about the hobby. His latest set of tweets involves his updated Sakurai gaming setup, which has decidedly gone vertical.
In a series of photos, he shows off his made-to-order shelves, which house numerous gaming consoles. Visibly, we can see an Xbox Series X, PS5, Switch, PS4, PS3, Wii U (!), Famicom (NES), Genesis, and SNES. The top plate and back are removed to push out heat, and he leaves the door open when playing. Adorably, he has a few controllers labeled with tiny little stickers, like "Xbox X" or "2" (presumably for player two). Those same labels adorn the power cables that plug into the wall (and the power supplies can be turned off individually).
An updated look at the Masahiro Sakurai gaming setup:
https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1559806360329392128
The most curious element is easily the horizontally-docked Switch. He even had to post a response tweet because of it! Here's what he said: "There was a reaction to the Switch dock horizontal placement...it's not recommended by the manufacturer, so do it at your own risk. This is just my personal experience, but I had no problems using it until I cleared Xenoblade Chronicles 3." Well, if Sakurai says it's okay! To be frank I never even really considered it, but it looks awesome on certain shelves.
If you're curious, PushDustIn chronicled Sakurai's previous setup in 2019 here. You can compare and contrast!

Not much has been revealed about it since then, other than a report from 2021 that detailed the show as a “gonzo, crazy, funny adventure.” However, images from the production’s set have begun to leak online, as reported by Eurogamer, and the show looks true and accurate to the famed video game series.

As you can see, the vault looks pretty spot-on, as do other details like the Vault-Tec logo. Even the vault suits look amazing, although, as the person who snapped that image mentioned, they are a little different from what we’re used to in the games. Nonetheless, my excitement for this series has grown considerably since seeing these images. Hopefully, this same attention to detail has been put into the writing. 
There is no release date for this series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Twitter account for Microsoft’s PC Game Pass service decided to change their profile picture, and coyly drew attention to its familiar looking mist-covered rocky backdrop with a tweet. "Sometimes we just like a good landscape picture," they said enigmatically. If you’re familiar with the Game Pass Twitter accounts, they like to do the flippant social media thing and tease followers. Well, this latest attempt has people speculating that the Sony-trademarked Death Stranding is about to hit PC Game Pass.

Publisher Secret Mode has announced that its side-scrolling adventure title Little Orpheus will launch on the Switch next month on September 13th.
The launch comes after the game was delayed indefinitely back in March of this year due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. At the time, the publisher stated that "some of the themes and content may be upsetting to players" due to potentially offensive references to the Soviet Union. However, after scouring through the game in the months since, it has determined that the game — developed by The Chinese Room of Dear Esther and Everybody's Gone To The Rapture fame — can launch without any changes to its content.

Originally due out this September, the game has now been delayed to November 22, 2022. Fortunately for those excited about the rootin’ tootin’ action of slaying vampires and killing other various (terrifying) creatures, this delay only pushes the game back by about two months. As for why, publisher Focus Entertainment released a statement on Twitter explaining that it’s the result of the team wanting the game to be the best it can be at launch. 
Here’s the studio’s statement, in full:

August 16, 2022
Evil West first premiered at The Game Awards 2020, and it immediately caught my attention. It gave me big Darkwatch vibes, a game I loved on PlayStation 2, and the first gameplay we saw at The Game Awards 2021 last December confirmed those vibes. If you’re looking for more of the game, you’re in luck because, in June, the studio released more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. 
Are you excited about Evil West? Let me know in the comments below! Also, if you played Darkwatch, that game was dope, right?]]></summary>

Mere weeks from the Loyal Samoyed controversy, Activision Blizzard is at the center of another plagiarism controversy pertaining to its military shooter franchise, Call of Duty. And once again, the accusations are pointing toward a brand new, but familiar-looking, character skin.
As reported by Polygon, the new plagiarism allegations are aimed at Call of Duty: Vanguard DLC skin "Doomsayer," a frighteningly imposing figure bedecked in black, full-body tactical armor, a grim reaper-style hood, and one of those wanky digital facemasks then were popular for a hot minute at comic-book conventions. The programmable faceplate sports a grimacing skull, a common design for the billion-dollar franchise.

Devolver Digital has always had an eye for some delightfully odd gaming experiences. Play as an ape escaping its captors while freeform jazz blasts in the background. Rob pretentious rich people as a con man in 18th century France. Eviscerate houses full of goons as a drug-addicted ninja with PTSD. The latest in this long line of the publisher's memorable releases, Cult of the Lamb, places you in the role of an adorable fluffy lamb harboring the soul of a sinister ageless deity. It’s intense, it’s cute, it’s stressful, and it’s absolutely something that you need to try out.
You begin your journey by being sacrificed by a woodland cult which is killing the poor creature because a prophecy stated that a lamb would be the vessel by which The One Who Waits would make its glorious return. The four resident Old Ones really weren’t fans of The One Who Waits, so they imprisoned it in another dimension to consolidate their power over the woodland creatures.

The achievement encompasses sales across physical and digital formats, though it's currently not known what the sales split is across the various territories. What's noteworthy, however, is the milestone has seemingly been reached much quicker than the game's predessecor, Fire Emblem Warriors, which reached 1 million units shipped roughly 7 months after its launch in September 2017. Three Hopes, on the other hand, launched a little less than 2 months ago in June 2022 (with no 3DS version, either!).

The selection for this month is a solid selection of indie gems, both new and old. Coffee Talk arrives today, letting you play barista to a host of creatures in alt-Seattle. Opus: Echo of Starsong arrives later on, bringing a vibrant art style and deep narrative to the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You only need one button
Ninja or Die is a peculiar name for a game, but I took a look at the ninja-slaying roguelite on Steam and I'm intrigued by... all of this. It's so fast and flashy, I can hardly keep up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94IVbgfT0p0
I've watched the trailer for Ninja or Die a few times now, and I'm still piecing it together; slow-mo helps, but I doubt it will fully click until we've tried playing it.
Nao Games and Marvelous Europe are hoping to blend "hardcore action" with "simple controls," and I'm curious to see how that will pan out once the training wheels are off. Specifically, Ninja or Die uses one-button controls. "Jump to where you point, eviscerate the enemy by dashing through them, and hold to attack with greater power."
The setup is that you're a secret agent in a "ninja-eat-ninja world" with bosses to bring down and hordes of smaller creeps to cut through. As a roguelite experience, death is a part of the deal and you'll accumulate perma-upgrades as well as alternate characters. You can power up your stats back at the village or "pay the back-alley doctor."
[caption id="attachment_340023" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Those pesky Big Kite Ninjas.[/caption]
As opposed to some recent roguelites, Ninja or Die seems to emphasize high scores and replayability over a loop-based format that's servicing a larger story. On that note, levels are "a mix" of procedural and hand-crafted, and there's an Infinite Watchtower to run.
The pieces might not all add up in the end, but the strangeness appeals to me. I just hope that when I'm the one leaping around Japan like a madman, I have a better sense of my busy surroundings. From the outside looking in, readability is a concern.
As luck would have it, there's a browser-based demo to get a feel for it.
Another one for the wait-and-see wishlist? I think so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. 
On Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.
ArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. 


“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”
Guild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.
Do you still play Guild Wars 2? Will you be picking it up on Steam to dive in for the first time? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

Thus far the result is a slew of reskin mods which let you replace Spidey with other characters and play while looking like Kingpin, Miles Morales, Mary Jane, or - as pictured above - Stan Lee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to make sure all those fancy skins transfer over
Overwatch 2 is just a few months away. We've known that Overwatch 2 will have cross-progression for a while, and today Blizzard is explaining just how all of it will work.
Cross-progression means that all progression and in-game cosmetics in Overwatch 2 will span across different systems. While previously having, say, a fancy Tracer skin on PlayStation 4 didn't mean you could access it on PC, the new system will merge and allow you to use the skin on both.
Starting today on August 16, players with a linked console account will be allowed to identify and confirm the accounts they want to merge. Once approved, the accounts will be prepared to merge on Overwatch 2's release. You'll need a Battle.net account no matter what, and all progress from the linked accounts will be stored on the Battle.net account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aB-H8QFXA0
As Blizzard notes with red text and emphasis, there is just one opportunity to merge accounts. Make sure you check which accounts are being merged when you do so.
The Blizzard explainer goes into further detail, including addressing a few specific circumstances some players might run into during the merge process. All of this should serve to provide a central platform, similar to games like Fortnite, where cosmetics purchased in one place will be available on the others as well.
One giant closet of cosmetics
As Overwatch 2 moves the game from loot boxes to passes and a shop, having that access is a good thing. It's doubly so, since Overwatch 2 will also be taking the place of Overwatch on its launch; like a massive title update for the multiplayer side. The single-player part of Overwatch 2, meanwhile, is expected to arrive sometime later on in the future.
Overwatch 2 will go live and free-to-play on October 4 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

The shrunken backyard antics of Grounded shine bright in co-op, as it's fun to build a base together that everyone can enjoy, and, y'know, spiders are just less intimidating when you've got backup. In the home stretch before the 1.0 release of Grounded on September 27, Obsidian announced a Shared Worlds feature to make multiplayer less of a hassle.
Here's the idea: You'll be able to create a Shared World that lives in the cloud and lets other players hop in even when you aren't around to host it. In other words, less time getting everyone's schedule on the same page, and more time smashing bugs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio is ramping up even more
Team Asobi seems to have big plans on the horizon. In the wake of launching its latest game, Astro's Playroom, as a PlayStation 5 pack-in title, its next project will be its biggest one yet.
In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, creative and studio director Nicolas Doucet talks about some of what Asobi's been up to post-Playroom. Team Asobi is looking to keep tooling around with the DualSense, a key part of Astro's Playroom. And it's also looking to expand in scope, too.
Doucet says Asobi's next game will follow in the footsteps of its previous games, will be a full-blown commercial title, and will be the "biggest to date" for the studio.
The team at Asobi has been steadily expanding, going from 35 to 60 members. Doucet expects that number to reach around 100. And the makeup is largely Japanese, which Doucet says the team wants to reflect in the games they make.
"We want to make sure that when people play our games that there is a feeling, and you can't quite put your finger on it, that it's made in Japan," said Doucet. You can find the full interview with GIbiz here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu5VXrEqgco
Astro's evolution
Team Asobi has been on a steady rise for some time. Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered one of the better PlayStation VR games around. And Astro's Playroom was a delightful pack-in console launch game. The platformer harbored tons of nostalgia for the history of PlayStation and its hardware.
Doucet and the team at Asobi have a clear penchant for working with the nuances of Sony's hardware. The studio lead says there's an extra team on the side at Asobi, always working on the technology and R&D. Where Asobi goes with the DualSense and its next big project, its biggest yet, will be exciting to see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.
The action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.

If it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.
The new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.]]></summary>

With Overwatch 2 set to release on Oct. 4, which is also when the game will replace the original Overwatch, now’s a great time to get all your cosmetics, loot boxes, and more in order. It’s also a great time to merge some accounts so that you can, for example, jump between playing on PC and PlayStation freely. Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. 
“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.
“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.”

Helmed and co-written by Fede Álvarez in his directorial debut, Evil Dead reimagines the unholy tale of the absolute nightmare that besieges a group of friends staying at an isolated log cabin. With the goal of supporting Mia as she attempts to go "cold turkey" on her heroi…]]></summary>

In their respective home countries of Spain and Italy, technical problems meant that legal subscribers missed matches at the start of the new season. Fortunately, a new Serie A anti-piracy campaign advertised in stadiums was 100% successful in reaching IPTV pirates.

[Update: Unity's board of directors has unanimously voted to reject AppLovin's $17.5 billion merger proposal. Calling the deal "not in the best interests of Unity shareholders," Unity is now expected to continue with its previous plans to merge with mobile software firm IronSource. As noted in the original article below, backing out of the IronSource deal was a key condition of the AppLovin proposal.
"We remain committed to and enthusiastic about Unity’s agreement with IronSource and the substantial benefits it will create for our shareholders and Unity creators," said Unity CEO John Riccitiello of the decision. "The board continues to believe that the IronSource transaction is compelling and will deliver an opportunity to generate long-term value." — Reuters]

VSFighting, perhaps the UK's most prestigious fighting game tournament, will make its grand return this week for the first time in three years. Players from across the UK, Europe, and wider international communities will gather together once again in a bid to lay claim to bragging rights in some of today's (and even some of yesterday's) hottest scrappers.
The annual throwdown, which has run yearly since its inception in 2010, has been on hiatus since 2019 — impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdown rulings. The coming weekend will see the 10th iteration of the tournament, once again hosted by West Midlands FGC Electronic Dojo, return to the Millennium Point complex in Birmingham for three days of sweet 'n' salty action.

Currently, Epic has implemented two big items into the mix:
Nimbus Cloud (an on-demand glider that lets you shoot into the air to glide with a cooldown timer, similar to other past items)
Kamehameha (an ability that's essentially an explosive beam, governed by a maximum of three charges)
You can find these items either through special vendors (Bulma at Kame House on the far east of the map in the island formation), "Dragon Ball" vending machines (marked on the map), or through capsules, which appear on the map like supply drops.

Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King was one of the early Switch success stories that showed how vital the system would be for indie developers. After being largely ignored on PC, the game dropped on the Switch eShop in December 2017 and sold more copies on the platform in one day than in the roughly nine months it had been available on Steam. The move actually saved the fledgling indie studio, and five years later, Castle Pixel is bringing players back to the world of Lily, Chrys, and Grandpa with Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince.

According to Gamespot, two bundles touting skins inspired by popular characters will be available for purchase. The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more.

Some items buff items touching them, while others benefit from empty spaces, or some insist upon being in a certain grid row, and some even move around by themselves. The buildcrafting gets fiendishly fun as your critter delves deeper into dungeons in search of a giant hunk of cheese.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Razer Huntsman Mini Analog is one of a vanishingly small number of keyboards with analogue switches, meaning each key knows exactly how far down it's being pressed. That unlocks the door to some unique capabilities, from adjusting the sensitivity of the keyboard on the fly to using the WASD keys as a thumbstick replacement in racing games. It's also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

More specifically, the Red Planet sequel to Deliver Us The Moon will no longer be released on September 27 and will instead hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 2, 2023. That's a delay of roughly four-ish months. As for why, KeokeN Interactive released a statement alongside the news, citing that the game needs more time to be the best it can possibly be.

More specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature "incredible new content" from Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a "sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media." 
JUST ANNOUNCED: Watch the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE on Friday, September 9 – live from #D23Expo 2022! https://t.co/uZcDYdUZKA pic.twitter.com/RJ67ooTR2F
August 15, 2022
You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindhack, an upcoming visual novel adventure, opens in a jail cell, as a criminal named Unid is brought before you by a pair of armed security guards. Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

        <updated>2022-08-15T13:47:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima, is being developed into a feature film with John Wick director Chad Stehelski set to direct it. The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

Where it differs is that there are also a few glimpses of the Island Sanctuary, FFXIV's new solo farming content. 

Watch it below ahead of the newly announced release date: August 23rd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. 
If you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

In it, you play a small stubby astronaut who dreams of hitting it big as an intergalactic property developer. Man, they really took the phrase 'colony sim' to its literal extreme, didn't they? Are we sure that isn't Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I'm saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn't... astronommical. Sorry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

August 11, 2022
As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a year riddled with delays, Metal Slug Tactics is the latest game to slip into next year. Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot 'em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.
The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

August 11, 2022
Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

Documents obtained by TorrentFreak suggest another incoming credibility boost - via HBO's lawyers in California.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.]]></summary>

You can't deal with losing it now. Oh god, let it stay there. Not now. Please, not now. But it happened (of course it did!). And you know what? You're okay. It wasn't the end of the world.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port's development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise. Let’s take a look, then, at how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered performs on PC – as well as the best settings to keep it swingin’ real smooth like.

As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we've decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It's an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a "comedy open-world RPG" where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You'll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, "Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022." Check it out for yourself below:

August 11, 2022
As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let's be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

And speaking of Switch, today's overview trailer reveals that Kirby's Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That's exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby's Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby's different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby's Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too). For more information about Kirby's Dream Buffet, be sure to check out this story. After that, read this Kirby series retrospective that dives deep into the character's origins and more.

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventu…]]></summary>

But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it's far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it's been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld's usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I'm excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.]]></summary>

The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs.

Here's the video:

One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom's robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize.

I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system. I only wish its base building provided …]]></summary>

Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in June during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

Betrayal At Club Low is the name, and an RPG infiltrating a former coffin factory-turned-nightclub is its game. This time, Cosmo D says he's inspired by one-shot indie RPGs as we roll dice, bake pizzas, and try to help an undercover agent escape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it's fun to listen to Fullerton's takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below.

        <updated>2022-08-09T18:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter's great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything. He finds them so fascinating that they're the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.

Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes.

Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven't discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
