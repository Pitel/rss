In fact, I really like the class system and how it operates, and Obsidian has used a similar setup in their other titles. You can pick between Fighter, Ranger, and Wizard, and all of them have their unique playstyles (including abilities). Naturally, every class has its strengths and weaknesses, so let's take a look at how the classes rank compared to each other.


Avowed Class tier list


I have used two tiers to classify the three available classes. The S-tier represents the very best class you can currently avail in Avowed, while the A-tier classes are marginally off the top. An A-tier class is still good, and they're still strong and worthy of your consideration if you want to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Various video game industry professionals have confirmed the passing of Victor Antonov, Half-Life 2's art director and the mastermind behind some of gaming's most harrowing cityscapes.


Antonov was born in Bulgaria and later moved to the US, where he received training at the Art Center College of Design in California, which he described as one of the harshest schools in existence. Antonov joined Valve in 2000 as the art director of Half-Life 2 and states that its development process and working with Gabe Newell was the best learning experience he ever had.


Half-Life 2 featured a huge shift to a more realistic neo-steampunk world design from the more gamey hallways of the original Half-Life, and a lot of that was owed to Antonov. He's the architect of the inhospitable City 17, the contrastingly beautiful seascape of Half-Life 2's Lost Coast DLC, and the co-creator of City 17's most iconic element, the Combine Citadel.




Many former colleagues have taken to social media to celebrate the man's fantastic contribution to video games. Dishonored's director, Raphael Colantonio, shared the regret of having never expressed how much admiration he had for Antonov, who was also the architect behind the beautifully dystopian Dunwall.




After leaving Valve for Arkane to make Dishonored, Antonov worked as an additional art director for Wolfenstein: The New Order and stayed at Bethesda to serve as a consultant on titles such as Fallout 4, Dishonored 2, DOOM (2016), and Prey.




On top of his brilliant and visionary contributions to gaming, Viktor Antonov will be remembered by the people he has worked with as a unique and remarkable human being.

Gears in Tower of Hell are very powerful, and the price is quite high, so think carefully when selecting them. The Hook and Hourglass are the most effective Gears to climb with, as they have very good utility in all situations. Gears like the Speed Coil have limited use since most obstacles require precision and not speed.

Then, Shattered Space came out and fell flat on its face, and I decided to wait it out as Bethesda continued improving things. Alas, silence.


It's early 2025, and Bethesda's been awfully mum about Starfield. Though Todd Howard did state ahead of Shattered Space's release that more DLCs would be coming in 2025 and onwards, the fact of the matter is that the studio's hype machine just kind of died down. Whether that's because Shattered Space didn't review well at all, or because there's simply nothing else to show off, the end result is much the same.

Sure, the world is a scary place, and facing it can seem like an overwhelming prospect, but there are books out there specifically designed to help you through even the darkest moments. Self-help books are always popular, but some are more impactful than others.

But if you're on this article, there's a good chance you have at least a passing interest in literature. Of course, all this peaceful reading can get in the way of some meaty gaming. Which is why I've compiled a list of short novels you can pick up and put down in between levels. Hell, you might even finish some of these before you get to the closing credits.

At the same time, however, Valve's vision for the Steam Deck's future is practically identical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Valentine's Event has returned to Blox Fruits, and you can earn Hearts to maximize the amount of rewards you can unlock.


Hearts represent the main form of currency you can get during the event, which can then be used at the in-game ship. Different items are periodically made available at the shop, and they will all require the event currency to unlock. Let's take a look at how you can earn them to spend on the in-game shop.


Best ways to get Hearts in Blox Fruits


It's pretty easy to earn Hearts in the game. To do so, you'll have to defeat NPCs close to your player level. Of course, you can defeat NPCs at any location to earn the resource, but the aim should be to farm it efficiently. For that, go to any endgame spot that has loads of enemies.


Secondly, you'll have to defeat NPCs who are within 100 levels of your own. This is the only pointer you need to keep in mind while defeating the enemies. You can also invite your friends to improve your chances of the amount of rewards you get from farming the NPCs.


Best ways to spend Hearts in Blox Fruits





Once you have earned Hearts, you'll be able to spend them in the Event shop. When you open the shop, you'll find different items available for various amounts. This includes a few really valuable items that usually cost more Hearts to get. There are a few event-exclusive items as well, like Heart Shades and Cupid's oat.


Here are the locations where you'll find the event shop.



Near the fountain in Middle Town (First Sea)


Cafe (Second Sea)


Inside a building near Castle On The Sea (Third Sea)



That's pretty much it all when it comes to gaining Hearts. Make sure to check out our guide on getting all the dojo belts in Blox Fruits.

Under pressure from dozens of powerful rightsholders, Real-Debrid's position looked precarious to put it mildly; not precarious enough for the service to throw in the towel, however. Three months later, a 16% drop in traffic is painful but non-fatal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Ashfall update in Fisch has added some interesting content, which includes solving a puzzle to open the secret Bunker at Birch Clay.


This spot was initially locked in the game, but the Volcano Eruption event has activated it. You can now visit the place and open the Bunker to head inside. To do so, you'll have to find a way to open the door.


How to get to the secret Bunker in Fisch


The first job is to reach the location where the Bunker is located. This part will be a lot easier if you already have a GPS device with you. Just go to the following coordinates, and you'll be at the correct location (XYZ: 1700, 143, -2400). Once you reach the location, you'll come across the white birch tree behind the arch.


Here, you'll find the secret Bunker, which you can open by just interacting with it. I am not sure if this was how the developers intended it to work. It seems that the main task is just to locate the Bunker, as you don't have to do anything more. Once you open the door, a dark tunnel will be revealed. Use the tunnel to travel all the way underground.





Once you head inside, you won't find anything with which you can interact with. It has a couple of lockers on either side of the room. There's a white-colored table as well, and you'll find a couple of photo framers. I believe that this location will be required as part of a future event to some degree, but so far, we don't have a precise idea.


Of course, you can complete the Dr. Finneus quest inside the game, which will require you to complete a hard task. Doing so will help you unlock an exclusive in-game title, along with a free boat themed around the Ashfall island.

Best attributes for a Ranger


You start out with 10 skill points you can assign to your character, since you are just starting out we would recommend focusing on a classic Ranger build, at least for the moment. It is possible to take your build in a different direction later on.


Since at the start, you can assign a maximum of three points per Attribute, we would recommend focusing on Dexterity and Perception, in particular. Later on, you can also invest in raising your maximum health points and resistance, by focusing on Constitution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To a certain crowd, survival and crafting are almost synonymous with each other. For a long while, possibly due to Minecraft’s success, in-depth crafting systems were always accompanied by some survival elements. However, that is no longer the case.


Some of the most complex and compelling crafting games ever made, like Factorio and its first expansion, feature almost no combat and survival at all. That said, it’s also true that nothing makes brewing a good cup of coffee as intense as the post-apocalypse or Half-Life-inspired alien invaders. If you’re looking for this oddly specific thrill, you want a survival crafting game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ashfall update in Fisch has introduced the Dr. Finneus quest in the game, and you can complete it to get a free boat for your efforts.


The Ashfall update is a mini-update, which comes ahead of the Mariana's Veil Core update. That said, you shouldn't sleep on the new content, and what better way to celebrate than to unlock a new boat? Let's take a look at how you can complete the quest, along with the new boat on offer.


Fisch Dr. Finneus quest guide


In case you're still unaware of it, the Ashfall location is situated near Roslit Bay. The event can only be accessed when the Roslit Bay volcano erupts. Once you reach the island, wait till the volcano erupts. If you have a GPS device, travel to the following coordinates (XYZ: -1450, 135, 750).


After the volcano erupts, go to the Central Bay area. Finneus can be found at the Volcano Research boat, and you'll have to talk with him. He will assign you a very simple task: complete the Ashfall Bestiary.


There are nine new types of creatures to catch if you want to complete the quest. All nine species are exclusive to the Ashfall region. Make sure to check out our complete guide about the preferred setup and weather conditions for all of them. This will help you to finish the bestiary quicker.





Once you complete your Ashfall Bestiary, head over to Dr. Finneus and talk with him. He will thank you for your efforts and offer you two rewards.



Volcanic Research Boat


Volcanic Helper Title



Here are the stats for the new boat.



Speed: 135 S/ps


Steering: 45


Acceleration: 0.3 S/ps



In terms of speed and acceleration, Fisch has better boats. That said, you don't have to spend any Robux or credits to buy it, and it can be a great choice for relative beginner players. Additionally, you'll get a new notification about a Mysterious Rock once you complete the Dr. Finneus quest.

Sadly, you will not be able to find all of these weapons in every round of Dead Rails you start, so making good use of the starting weapons is crucial if you want to make it far.

This is the final minor update we will get prior to the Mariana's Viel update, which is coming soon. Unlike last week, we have new fish to catch this time around, and to do so, you'll have to travel to Ashfall. This location can be found near the Roslit Bay area, and let's take a look at which new creatures can be caught.

Here's the full list of all nine new fish that have been added as part of the new Bestiary. Let's take a look at what time, season, and bait is preferable to catch them from the Ashfall region. The region is relatively easy to reach and find, and it gets simpler if you have the GPS device.

Ashfall location in Fisch


If you have a GPS, go to the coordinates (XYZ: -1435, 125, 460). This location actually falls under Roslit Bay, right at the point where the ocean breaks into the volcano. To catch the new creatures, you can choose any spot that's situated in the Ashfall region.


If you are looking to complete other bestiaries in Fisch, make sure to check out our full list for the Atlantis update that happened earlier in January 2025. It's also going to be interesting to find out how many new creatures are released during the next core update.

There’s no question that Nintendo makes some of the best video games in the world thanks to its incredibly skilled and passionate in-house and partner developers. But how often does the company let those developers speak freely about the games they make?
Last year we got the opportunity to chat with the legendary artist Takaya Imamura, famous for Star Fox, Captain Falcon and the many machines in F-Zero, and even Majora’s Mask itself. He was with Nintendo for over 30 years working on countless games until leaving the company in 2021 to pursue something different. So, naturally, we said 'Yes!' and flew thousands of miles to sit down with the man himself.

The complicating factor is that Cinta isn’t entirely gone: she is a voice in Rama’s head, chatting to him throughout the game's 28-day storyline as though sitting next to the player on the other side of the screen.

We were more than a little surprised when Hideki Kamiya and Capcom popped up at The Game Awards to announce an Okami sequel. Surprised, but excited. The title is still in early development and we know very little about it, but in a recent interview with IGN, some of its creatives began to explain what we can expect from the sequel and how it'll fit with the series' previous entries.
Throughout the interview with Kamiya, Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, and Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata, the trio refer to the upcoming sequel as "a continuation of the story that we saw in the original game". But, as any Okami fan will be able to tell you, we've already seen a follow-up (of sorts) in the 2011 DS follow-up, Okamiden.

In the interests of a more productive outcome, here are some lovely/interesting/terrifying little PC games that I could have started and finished while waiting for the closed beta to sort itself out, and that you might enjoy regardless of whether you’ve just spaffed away a perfectly good afternoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's something uncanny about dipping "classic" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.

Before Nintendo Switch Online, there was Virtual Console. Available on the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U, the Virtual Console was effectively a line of purchasable retro games available via the Wii Shop Channel and eShop.
Unlike Nintendo Switch Online, which offers up a range of playable games for an annual or monthly cost, Virtual Console allowed you pay for games ad-hoc, enabling you to download whichever title you wanted and keep it indefinitely. While we certainly love what Nintendo has been doing with Switch Online over the years, it's no secret that lots of fans would rather the firm revert back to the Virtual Console model.

We are quickly closing in on Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma's 30th May release date and, with love in the air this Valentine's Day, publisher Marvelous! has shared a pair of new trailers to introduce the game's romance candidates.
Broken into 'Meet the Bachelors' and 'Meet the Bachelorettes,' the trailers showcase all 16 (yes, sixteen) romance options for the upcoming Rune Factory RPG. As you'd hope, every candidate seems to pack a dramatic backstory and lofty ambitions, with their titles spanning the full range of ridiculousness from the relatively tame 'Wandering Hero' to 'Prestigious God of Light and the Heavens" — damn, we know which one we'd rather add to our LinkedIn.

At the end of last year, Falcom announced that it was working on a Switch remaster of the 2012 PS Vita title Ys Memoire: Memories of Celceta (in Japan, at least). Well, what do you know, that very remaster now has a release date of 22nd May 2025 (thanks, Gematsu).
Yes, this one isn't confirmed for a Western release at the time of writing, but seeing how Oath in Felghana ended up getting localised around two years after its Japanese release, we'd wager that it will get an international launch at some point in the future.

Formerly known as System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, this remaster will be a modernised version of Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios' 1999 survival horror sequel and was originally announced in 2019 following Nightdive's re-releases in the mid-2010s. Yes, it seems odd that you'd rename something as the '25th Anniversary Remaster' after you missed the 25th anniversary last year...but hey, good game=good game, we guess!

This review was originally published in May 2014. We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GBA library.

Although Wario's core platforming series has been overshadowed for years by the surrealist microgames of WarioWare, his excellent platformers have the sort of devoted following that inspires 600-page eBooks. It's easy to see why: Wario Land 4 takes the basic 2D platforming concepts of Mario and turns them on their head in an irreverent, boisterous adventure unafraid to take risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And Animal Well wins 'Best Direction'.
The 28th annual DICE Awards ceremony has recently taken place in Las Vegas, and though Astro Bot robbed Nintendo of any potential wins (perhaps deservedly, to be honest – it's a bloomin' good game), there were a few notable nods toward a couple of outstanding indie titles available on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign will get "additional playable characters and bosses" via DLC, according to an entry on the game's Steam page. This isn't massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla Elden Ring. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, Dark Souls trilogy, Sekiro and Bloodborne reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.

After a handful of delays, Level-5 has today announced the new new release date for Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, which we can now expect to put down roots on Switch on 21st May 2025.
This highly anticipated life-sim has felt like a long time coming. Initially announced in the 2023 February Direct, The Girl Who Steals Time was billed for a release later that year before being pushed to Summer 2024. This date then moved to October '24, before a further delay moved things to an April 2025 window. Phew.

The colours alter from daytime greyness through winey shades of sunset into pale lavender moonlight. There are little details to notice and zoom on: a fleeting embroidery of rain, the seep of flames in the kitchen and guest rooms, a fidgeting of moths in the archives. Ah, nice.

Happily, Avowed does at least launch in much better shape, and with some genuinely fetching fantasy visuals that may even justify flicking on ray tracing. The PC version does, however, still seem to have a few loose wires, which are worth watching out for even if you can tidy some up with the right settings.

The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we're back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian's latest RPG Avowed. We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!
Nic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?
James: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.
Otherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.
Nic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to "come hither" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.
It's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?

Developed by South Korean studio Shift Up and published by Sony, it's about fighting monsters on post-apocalyptic Earth by means of combos, parries and gauge-based super moves. It's got an open world full of NPC quest-givers and creatures designed by Hee-Cheol Jang, the mad scientist behind the menageries of Okja and The Host. It's also got a protagonist we can summarise as Bayonetta played straight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avowed is almost good, but there's something so resigned and workmanlike to its quest design and storytelling that it often feels like dog-eared chorelist of Obsidian must-haves, ticked off so aimlessly that the result is a bit like having an RPG described to you by someone late for a bus.
And that should be that, really. I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.
But, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.
Ignore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.

Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of "fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true," claiming his former company was "targeted" by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.

I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. Asteroid 2024 YR4 loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.


If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool Asteroid Launcher, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French football clubs held emergency talks after broadcaster DAZN withheld millions of euros in TV rights payments due this month. The dispute concerns DAZN's claims that Ligue 1 football league body LFP failed to suppress piracy and fell short in other areas too. Hopes of an amicable solution faded when DAZN paid 50% of the sum owed for February and put the other €35 million into an escrow account.  LFP responded by launching legal action in Paris.

Film Captain America: Nový svět (který má v úvodních titulcích pouze "Brave New World" a žádného Captaina) je pravděpodobně začátkem nové filmové megasérie, která nám v příštích filmech pravděpodobně představí "nové" Avengers, nové X-Men a pravděpodobně také nové multiverzní nebezpečí. Píšu několikrát "pravděpodobně", protože musím přiznat, že se v aktuálním Marvel vesmíru neorientuji tolik, jako jsem se v minulých desetiletích orientoval ve filmových X-Men a Hulkovi (protože jsem je překládal).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hunt: Showdown and Crysis developers Crytek are dismissing an estimated 15 percent of their workforce - around 60 people out of 400 – in the face of “the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years”. This comes after they paused development of mechsuit FPS sequel Crysis 4 last year, with staff shifting over to Showdown’s live service reboot Hunt: Showdown 1896. Crytek now say they need to cut back in order to remain “financially sustainable”.

Remedy's exceptionally good horror game Alan Wake 2 is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.
As of September last year, the musical-with-guns had "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. "October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2," says the report.

They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as "completely abrupt and impersonal". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO "fake", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.
Kotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.
That petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.

I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.

Also, the urge to browse the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods, to see what players of the RPG were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.

Gotech was previously hit with a widely publicized $101m judgment following a Nagravision copyright lawsuit. Yet, not only was the amount never paid, the judgment was fully vacated. In what can only be described as a bizarre finale,  GoTech now promotes Nagra as its partner.

As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve's handling of such things hasn't really changed over the past few years, but I can't pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can't bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.

Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game's advanced access period.

As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

Some trivia from a person who's been in a relationship for decades: Valentine's Day comes less than a month after "Blue Monday", the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week's new PC games likely won't help, assuming you aren't especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well.

That never happened for me with music critic Neil Kulkarni, though I must have read his work given the music magazines he wrote for. That changed a couple of weeks ago when I went to Kieron's (RPS in peace) newsletter in search of his piece in rememberance of J Nash (included in a prior Papers), in which he linked to his similar piece on Kulkarni, who passed last year. I read the examples of Kulkarni's work that Kieron linked, and then the Kulkarni articles the man himself linked, and several hours and several layers deep, I thought: oh no, Neil Kulkarni was one of my guys.

The true scale of site blocking action in Europe, let alone the world, is effectively proprietary information to which the public has zero access. It may be the ideal time for global site blocking to implement global transparency by default.

Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Shogun Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. 

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water. "I don't know if that means I should recommend Mark Ffrench's games Proverbs and Mega Mosaic to you, or warn you to steer clear and avoid flowing away forever," responded commenter SeekerX.

You see where this is going. Friends, I played Proverbs for 36 hours over Christmas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not the destination, they say, it's the pickled eggs we slurped along the way. In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here's a clip on Atelier and that fucking bag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they're currently working on. The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't end up covering as many classic point and click adventures as I'd like on RPS. That's a real shame, because every time I play a good one, I'm reminded how much magic the genre still has. Developer Blyts (Kelvin And The Infamous Machine) was kind enough to send me over a key for Slender Threads, which is out this Friday. My opinion as a complete non-expert on the genre? Yep, this one's absolutely worth a look.

It's the sort of boast most demon swordsman like to trot out, in my experience. And yet! I have to admit that this Gogandantess lad has a real flourish to him. He's going places, I reckon. Chief among those places being PC at some point in 2025, and he's bringing the rest of Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny with him. Catch him showing off in the below trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhorse's medieval muck-o-rama Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launches today. It's an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra's tendency to throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns. Also, a relatively bug-free one. 


In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several hours in, it’s become apparent that I lack the patience for much of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s much-publicised historical accuracies, like needing to bathe yourself every six minutes or how 15th century Bohemians can take several consecutive sword swings to the neck without dying. Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry's Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry's short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as "Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.

"The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag Disco Elysium's protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friendly skateboarding game OlliOlli World and its rollerskating gun friend Rollerdrome have been delisted on Steam for unknown reasons. If you go to the store page for OlliOlli World, you'll currently see the classic delisted message: "Notice: OlliOlli World is no longer available on the Steam store." The same thing appears on the Rollerdrome page. No, we're not sure why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ye to the walls, pikefolk of PC gaming. We've had a languid and fattening winter with a quiet game arriving here and there to peddle its wares. But the calm times are coming to an end. The big releases now march towards us in droves. But they do not know what lies waiting for them in the moat. The slick scales of the Maw surface in the moonlight, groaning, waiting, sick with hunger for fresh releases. The battle is yet to start, but we will upturn the chumbucket of news into the water below. Feed it, for heavens sake. FEED THE MAW!

Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer.

        <updated>2025-01-31T17:48:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou "message" než "když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
