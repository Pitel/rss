The case was backed by IP address evidence and a financial investigation, but things didn't go exactly to plan. A court of appeal decision handed down Thursday couldn't alleviate the disappointment.

The official game page for the new Endless Ocean has also gone live, with digital and physical pre-orders now available. This game is part of Nintendo's voucher program (available in select regions) as well, so if you have a voucher spare, you'll be able to get this game with it!

Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.

"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. "Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.

There’s no denying that Mercy is one of the most popular heroes in Overwatch. In fact, on console, she’s the top pick. And it’s for that reason she’s developed a fanbase that’s absolutely ravenous for new skins. But will Mercy get the Mythic skin for Season 10?


As much as support mains and Mercy lovers might want to see our angelic, overworked doctor at the end of a battle pass, it’s unlikely that Mercy will have a Mythic skin in Season 10. And we can chalk that up to the fact that Moira just had a…]]></summary>

The in-universe casino is home to plenty of painstaking MMO grinds and some of them gate beloved mounts, minions, and titles. The Gold Saucer's currency, MGP, stands between you and those prizes.


Ultimately, it doesn't have to be the most miserable, grindy experience, and you can make the best use of your time with a few of my favorite FFXIV MGP farming tips. My guiding advice here: prioritize any MGP event, seek every MGP Platinum Card you can, and do Challenge Log weeklies. Additionally, prioritize limited-time rewards like those from the FF16 crossover event, or the FF15 Regalia.

The manga first started its legendary run in 2001 in the Weekly Shonen Jump magazine before branching out into the first anime adaptation from Pierrot in 2004. Here are all of the Bleach story arcs in order, without any spoilers. 


All Bleach story arcs, explained


There is a total of around 14 different story arcs in the Bleach manga and anime series. This number only gets a bit complicated due to the various parts that make up some of the arcs, plus the differences between the manga and anime. The anime adaptation has a couple of exclusive filler arcs to it not featured in the original manga. 


Here are all of the Bleach story arcs you need to know about in order:

Dragon's Dogma 2 is unabashedly a silly game. I've never seen NPCs, ranging from random beggars to blue-blooded elites, so eager to approach my 6'5" cat-man and start throwing hands.

What's really interesting and authentic about Tales of Kenzera: Zau is that it includes both English and Swahili language versions at launch for you to play through on day one.

How to make Island in Infinite Craft


To make an Island in Infinite Craft, use the following combinations to get there.



Earth + Earth = Mountain


Mountain + Water = Lake


Lake + Lake = Ocean


Earth + Ocean = Island



It’s really that simple to create an Island in this game. 


With this now in your inventory, you can start getting creative and even create other countries, things from other regions in the world, or even political words.

Words to combine with Island in Infinite Craft


So, Island is just a start. Here are some combinations to get you started with this word:



Island + Volcano = Hawaii


Island + Rainbow = Paradise


Island + Dinosaur = Jurassic Park


Island + Love = Turtle


Island + War = Pirate


Island + Harrison Ford = Castaway


Island + Snake = Medusa



These are just a few I messed around with to see what combinations you can get. However, the real fun begins when you combine Earth with Island to get Continent.



Continent + Sushi = Japan


Continent + Mountain = Asia


Continent + Swamp = Africa


Continent + Sheep = Australia


Continent + Love = Europe


Continent + President = America



These are just another select few that you can get after creating Continent. Using Island as a stepping stone, you can now get into all sorts of cultural words. For example, you can get Anime from Japan, Trump (with a poop emoji) through America, and so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The early stages of a new weapon can be a bit rough due to the limitations of Gunsmith items. Although you'll claim these tools later on, it can sometimes take a while with the more advanced levels. So, to quicken the pace, here's how to use the Unlock All Attachments glitch in MW3 and Warzone. 


Unlock All Attachments Without Leveling Up Glitch in MW3 and Warzone, explained


To unlock all attachments without leveling up in Warzone and MW3, customize a gun in a Private match. The weapon must be unlocked first in Multiplayer or Warzone, as the Base version is required. For example, if you haven't completed three Daily Challenges for the TAQ Evolvere, you won't be able to utilize the glitch for this gun's attachments. 


Once you have a weapon in mind, go to the Private Match section in either the Warzone or MW3 Playlist. Now, select the Weapons section and customize the gun with any attachments. Private Matches provide access to the entire catalog, regardless of whether it is locked in the Public Playlists. Press 'Save a Custom Mod,' which is shown in the bottom-left corner. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Exit the Private Match and select a public game in Warzone or MW3. Go to the Weapons section, and the saved custom mod should now be available in the Gunsmith section. This allows you to access all attachments without leveling up, even if the Base version doesn't include these tools. I tried it out with my previous locked items and had no problems when diving into a match. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


The glitch for unlocking all attachments has appeared throughout Call of Duty's timeline. However, it does seem to get patched after some time. With MW3 and Warzone Season 3's launch, the glitch has come up again now that the game has been updated. The trick could eventually be patched, so just bear that in mind for the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palworld is a game where you don’t often have to think about your actual save game file. If, for any reason, you need to back it up or move it, it can be tough to find. It’s buried in the user documents behind some vaguely named folders. Let’s just move on to the next paragraph, where I can be more specific.


Palworld save games location for Steam


On PC, if you want to reach your save data, just paste this path into Windows Explorer's address bar: %localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames and it should take you straight to it. 


If it doesn’t take you there because, for example, you haven’t rebuilt your user profiles after several OS upgrades, then you should be able to follow this path there: C:\Users\insertusernamehere\AppData\Local\Pal\Saved\SaveGames. “C:” can be whatever drive letter is holding your OS.


Note that you cannot just browse to the saved games through the game’s Steam properties. The saved game is not contained within the Steam folder; it’s in your user files.


Also note that the AppData folder is sometimes hidden by windows. While the %localappdata% string should still take you there, you may need to go to the view tab on the ribbon and check the box next to “hidden files.”


Each saved game is a folder that is named a long string of numbers. If you’re backing up your saves (for example, if you're installing mods), that’s what you’re going to want to copy elsewhere.


Palworld save games location for Gamepass


The method to finding the Gamepass version’s save files is different is different. For that one you’ll want to use %localappdata%\Packages\PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\SystemAppData\wgs


Otherwise, navigate to C:\Users\insertusernamehere\AppData\Local\Packages\PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\SystemAppData\wgs


Again, you may need to enable “hidden files” in the ribbon to actually get this far. However, in the wgs folder you should find your saves. You can then copy them elsewhere.

I hate fishing mini-games. I’ve made no secret of it, and anyone who knows will tell you that if I can avoid any fantasy fishing, I absolutely will. This is a bit of a problem, considering the fact that I tend to favor ‘cosy’ games, which invariably have some form of fishing mechanic. Even while playing Final Fantasy XIV, I’ve had no choice but to level Fisher and take part in Ocean Fishing, but I’ve never done it without complaining the entire time. 


My biggest complaint is just the sheer monotony of the task. Pick a spot,  press a button, and voila…]]></summary>

Savage Level describes Flint as a double-A game that takes inspiration from one of piracy's most famed fictional stories: Treasure Island.

In Dark and Darker Mobile, players are thrown into a low fantasy world and tasked with exploring dungeons deep underground, in search of treasure. Once they find it, they must decide whether to keep searching or make a quick escape with what they've got, though the best treasure is always the deepest-in. Dungeon delves can also see you joined by other players who can either help or hinder you, adding yet another layer to the tension between spoils and survival.

Where to find diamond in Minecraft


Minecraft uses a coordinates system for indicating where you are in any given world. This system shows the player’s location on the X, Y, and Z-axes at all times. For the purpose of getting diamonds, you want to focus on the Y-axis, which is the second number when it comes to your in-game location. This number changes as you go up and down throughout the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar Blade director Kim Hyung Tae has announced that developer ShiftUp's upcoming action game, Stellar Blade, will get a New Game+ mode sometime after launch. Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. 
This news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. 


"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package," Tae told Ruliweb. "The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon." 
Given that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. 
Stellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wimpod makes its first-ever Shiny debut in Pokémon Go, giving this Bug and Water Type a sparkling new take. However, this version is incredibly rare to find, as we've seen with most creatures in this category. We're here to help you narrow down the search by showing you how to get Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go.


Where to find Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go


Shiny Wimpods spawn more frequently in the wilds during the Sizeable Surprises event. The event lasts until April 9, 2024, at 8 p.m. local time, so you must watch out for it before then. Keep farming as many Wimpods as possible, and you may be lucky enough to stumble upon the Shiny version. 


The event-themed Field Research tasks may also provide a Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go. Complete these limited-time objectives to encounter this version. Specifically, the 'Catch three Wimpod' task can unlock the Shiny Wimpod's spawn. Use PokéStops to trigger these Field Research quests, as they won't appear automatically. Although you may be inclined to test the waters in Raids, Shiny Wimpods do not appear in these challenges.

If you miss your chance during Sizeable Surprises, don't worry; there's another opportunity shortly after. Shiny Wimpods can appear during the Bug Out event, which starts on April 12 at 10 a.m. and ends on April 17 at 8 p.m. local time. Complete any event-themed Field Research tasks during this celebration to spawn this type. 


To evolve the Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go, use 400 Wimpod Candy. This ingredient requires plenty of Wimpod captures, but luckily, these events consistently spawn this creature.

ConcernedApe seems to love packing mysteries and easter eggs into Stardew Valley, with the most recent addition being Meowmere, which was added in update 1.6. But the secrets don’t stop there, some of these go way back to the beginning of the game, or have evolved over time.

How to cure bloodshot Pal eyes in Palworld


Low Pal SAN stats cause bloodshot eyes in Palworld. If your Pal has been working for a while without breaks, has no access to hot springs, or is stuck at the bottom of a ledge, it will slowly gain status debuffs. The best way to cure this is to bring your Pal into your Palbox and let it recuperate or toss it into a hot spring to raise its SAN.

It's one of several new item additions to multiplayer horror game and can be a pretty fun tool for filming your videos for Spooktube. Here is how to use the Projector in Content Warning and why it exists in the first place.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Where is the Projector?


The Projector kind of blends in and can be tricky to find if you don't know where to look. When you first step out of the house, look for the Sunflowers in the back straight ahead. Head forward until you reach the Sunflowers and then look to your left and you will see both the Projector and the Projector screen.


For now, it seems as though the Projector and screen are static, meaning you can't change where they are and will always have to return to this location when you want to use the Projector.


Screenshot by Destructoid


What can you do with the Projector?


As you approach the actual Projector, hit E to turn it on. It will now display a slide or image on the Projector's green screen in front of you. There are two knobs on the top of the Projector that you can also interact with to cycle through all the different backgrounds to display on the screen. Interacting with the right knob will show you the next scene while interacting with the left knob goes to the previous screen. You can cycle through all the scenes to find some pretty cool ones like city landscapes, backdrops, images of space, a breaking news screen, and much more.


The Projector exists for you and your friends to record some cool footage on your Video Camera before descending to the Old World or after returning. You can use the screen in the background to create backdrops for your footage which will spruce it up and get you more views when you upload it to Spooktube!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Success in AFK Journey really comes down to your party. Not merely the characters you have fill it, but their roles as well. As a gacha game, your available heroes in AFK Journey is going to come down largely to luck. You’ll hopefully be able to, at the very least, fill certain roles, so we’ll stop there.


Now, before we get started, I’m going to help you leg up that basically everyone recommends. Get yourself Thoran. When I was starting out, that’s the hero that kept on popping up on the list. And to be honest, when I slotted him into my party and put him on the frontline, I improved considerably.


Screenshot by Destructoid


With that in mind, and even if you don’t have Thoran, the ideal party follows RPG rules: 



DPS, Tank, and Healer 



The other two are wild cards. This isn’t a hard rule in terms of party comp, but it’s the most effective one.


Healers can be the hardest to spot to fill, since not every Support hero has strong healing spells. You’ll need to actually look at what spells they have to ensure they have ones for effective healing. Hewynn, for example, can heal the whole group in one spell.


For DPS, your Warriors are the most all-around, but my personal preference is mages. Cecia has been my favorite for a while now, as one of her spells spawns an additional unit to both take and deal further damage. Often, I see Odie recommended as an archer role, which, again, I slotted into my party, and things immediately improved.


As for your tank: Thoran. If you don’t have Thoran, any hero with the Tank role can generally fill this spot. The more you rely on DPS, the more important a tank is.


For your wildcards, Scarlita is an excellent choice for shields. Another mage is often my preference because I love mages. With that in mind, maybe just pick the heroes you connect with most. However, if you want further recommendations of who belongs in your party, check out our AFK Journey tier list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many social media platforms have been discovered in Infinite Craft's ever-growing library. This guide will focus on how to make YouTube, one of the most well-known forms of media. 


Infinite Craft YouTube combination


Geysir and Internet are the key ingredients to making YouTube in Infinite Craft. There are a few ways to unlock these elements, but we'll use the quickest method for the sake of time. So, let's start with how to make Internet in Infinite Craft.



Fire + Water = Steam


Steam + Fire = Engine


Engine + Steam = Train


Engine + Engine = Rocket


Rocket + Train = Bullet Train


Rocket + Rocket = Satellite


Bullet Train + Satellite = Internet



Now that we have Internet, it's time to create a Geysir:



Earth + Fire = Lava


Lava + Earth = Stone


Water + Fire = Steam


Stone + Steam = Geysir



Combine Geysir and Internet to make YouTube on Infinite Craft. To see a full coverage of the entire recipe, here's what it should look like:

I'm not quite sure how Internet and Geysir create YouTube on Infinite Craft. However, this unique combination is quite possibly the quickest way to reach this recipe. Like many creations, there are a ton of ways to utilize YouTube. For an instant shot at fame, use Internet and YouTube to unlock Viral. You can also combine it with Game to create the YouTuber Pewdiepie. But, if you want the complete experience, use Money and YouTube to make Ads.

I, for one, applaud the developer's efforts to realistically depict someone who can barely run for three seconds (I am so out of shape, I'm non-euclidean).


What else makes it such an intriguing horror game is the pretty accurate array of tools to help you identify spectral beings. One of those is a good old-fashioned thermometer, as some Phas ghosties turn their room into popsicles with freezing temps. 


We're all aware – whether we're believers or not – that ghostly activity is typically linked with a sudden drop in temperatures; sometimes referred to as "cold spots." Phasmo embraces that idea, so we're going to take a quick look at the game's Thermometers and how each tier can …]]></summary>

Genuinely, I've been humiliated on this count in RPS morning meetings, with certain "colleagues" whose names rhyme with "Malice Knell" making references I don't understand and laughing at my expression of hurt and confusion. My grasp of reality TV basically ends with the finale of the very first season of Big Brother, feat. Nasty Nick. But you could argue that you don't need to watch reality TV to understand and enjoy reality TV, because the basic reality TV thrill of forming weird parasocial attachments to people who are role-playing as themselves is now the golden rule of digital society generally.


"'Reality' stuff is huge now, and it's not just reality TV," says Nicole He, designer of The Crush House - an enticing, absurdist and engrossingly unpleasant new sim from Reigns and Card Shark developers Nerial. "It's any kind of celebrity or influencer or streamer or something like that - there are so many parasocial relationships in that way, and I think that really started with reality TV, and then [continued] in the era of social media. It's one of those topics that we don't talk about in an explicit way, necessarily, but it's something that you hopefully think about as you're playing the game."

We also talk about the science that suggests people process visual information at wildly different speeds (I know I shouldn't have said that some people just 'see more fasterer' or whatever reductive thing I said, please don't email me), Nate teaches me about some weird cryptids, and we recommend some sweet non-video game stuff, as per usual.

Dubbed v0.2.0.6, the Steam version of this update for PC players is already live; the Xbox version will be released when it's ready, according to Pocketpair. 
As for what to expect, today's update is one of Palworld's biggest. But chief among the additions is the game's first raid boss, a heavily anticipated aspect of the survival game's endgame. Let's break it all down:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uniqlo stores currently offer Capcom-inspired clothes that feature the likes of Street Fighter 6, Resident Evil 4, and more, alongside other items of apparel inspired by Konami's Metal Gear Solid series. Now, Uniqlo has revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the next game to get the t-shirt treatment.
The clothes will launch in Japan this month – Uniqlo is based in Japan – before a release in the West happens at some point in the future, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. As for when exactly to expect these shirts to hit the states, though, that remains unknown. 
The Tears of the Kingdom line consists of six shirts, and you can check each out in the gallery below: 

On the Japanese website for Uniqlo, each of these shirts is listed for 1,500 Yen, which converts to less than $10 a shirt. However, the price could be raised when these shirts come to Uniqlo stores in the states.

        <updated>2024-04-04T12:13:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh new batch of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II previews have dropped today, which is how we learned Ninja Theory co-founder and Hellblade director-writer Anteem Antoniades is no longer at the studio. It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. 
Speaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. 


Regardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because "the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing." Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

It was the afternoon of day four at GDC, my adrenaline reserves were spent, and there I was, in a warm, shuttered hotel room, with two men gently bombarding me with French-accented details of synergies, stackable trinkets and i-frames (I'm aware that the scenario I've just described is probably somebody's kink - let's move swiftly on).


Windblown itself is an airy, bright fusillade of Saturday morning cartoon vibes, a series of breakneck arena fights waged on procedurally generated island chains floating against a whirlpool sky. It's all shaping up very nicely, and if I'd been playing the demo, I'm sure it would have woken me up better than any emergency deluge of instant coffee. But watching somebody else tear through this stratospheric world simply overloaded my depleted senses, and I came perilously close to nodding off.

This news comes from a new Polygon preview of Ninja Theory's upcoming release, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, which hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Polygon noticed during a hands-on preview of Hellblade II at Ninja Theory's Cambridge, U.K.-based studio that there was no trace of Antoniades. A spokesperson for Xbox confirmed later that Antoniades was no longer working at Ninja Theory.


"On my visit, there was no sign or mention of Ninja Theory's flamboyant founder and Hellblade writer-director Tameem Antoniades," Polygon writes in its Hellblade II preview. "An Xbox spokesperson later confirmed to Polygon that he is no longer with the studio. Antoniades was involved in Hellblade 2 in the early stages, but the game now has a trio of creative leads: environment art director Dan Attwell, visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill, and audio director David Garcia." 
Beyond the Hellblade series, Antoniades also worked on Ninja Theory's Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, and DmC: Devil May Cry. 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

The statement, which also mentions nefarious goings on involving the very much banned RMT (real money trading), details the recent fixes released to combat these issues, as well as the identification and banning of accounts found to have broken the game’s terms of service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not saying that Zuzu, the star of melancholic 2D adventure Skaramazuzu, is definitely inspired by that Adventure Time bit where the deer takes off its hooves like gloves. But I am saying that if it were, it’d have my full support, because the freak deer deserves to live on forever, even as a shadow wandering a gothic purgatorial landscape in an unrelated game. 
We got a trailer for this one a few weeks back, and the game itself just dropped on Steam yesterday. It’s got that specific blend of Hollow Knight: Silksong -esque maudlin and whimsy that I personally love, skirting around the edges of both without slipping too readily into Tim Burton territory. The artstyle is crisp and wintery, the writing is goofy, and everything that moves looks like it evolved from the same dead tree branch. Feast your hooves on the trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair have released a new Palworld update, Steam version v0.2.0.6, which introduces the monster-catching survival game's first Raid Boss, a gloating Gothy squid-lady by the name of Bellanoir. She'll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the "extreme" version of the boss. Bellanoir can't be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.


This is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you'll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.

When you think of the most 'iconic' video game character of all time, who pops into your head? Could it be Link? Perhaps Pac-Man? What about Sonic? Chances are that Mario would be your number one, right? Well, you'd be wrong.
According to recent poll results from BAFTA on the 'Most Iconic Video Game Characters of All Time', Mario only managed to bag the silver medal. Instead, it was Tomb Raider's Lara Croft who wound up dominating the competition to snatch the number one spot after over 4,000 people cast their votes.

For the English Premier League, a £43m deal with Match TV was suspended but Russians wasted no time exploring other options. Pirate IPTV services, web-based streaming portals, and streams on betting apps filled the void. HD presentations on the social networking site VK also hit the spot, complete with homegrown commentary teams and custom graphics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the popular free-to-play Star Wars collectible turn-based strategy RPG mobile game, is coming to PC with cross-save functionality and improved performance. Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, "We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC." The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.
Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately "there is no controller support at this time"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, "The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time."
Beta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: "For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta."

Updated with Rebel Transmute, a brutally difficult take on the Metroid side of the formula. Enjoy!

The word 'Metroidvania' might rub some core gamers the wrong way, but it's a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map. As you explore and find secrets throughout the environment, these games empower the player in a way that makes them extremely addictive.

While Ubisoft Forward and Summer Game Fest aren't technically connected, they typically take place during the same time frame in LA, and this year is no different. With Summer Game Fest's livestream set for June 7, with the invite-only media and influencer event for hands-on gameplay with upcoming games set for June 8 through June 10, it seems press, influencers, and fans will cap off the summer's gaming streams with Ubisoft Forward. 
It’s back ✨

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today Tom Betts - founder of Nullpointer and former lead programmer at The Signal From Tolva developers Big Robot - emailed me about his new game The Horror At Highrook. In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.
This is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.

It’s also, I’ll admit, overdue some consideration on RPS. Between the lack of cheap graphics cards among the desktop RTX 40 series, the year-and-a-bit that DLSS 3 has had to grow its compatible games library, and the Steam Deck reminding everyone that portable, low-end gaming can still be pleasurable, now seems like the RTX 4050’s time to shine.

The victors of that particular forum skirmish were probably DICE's Battlefield games, with their woozy Frostbitten cinematography and dependable multiplayer tactic of having a whole team focus fire on a single capture point, gradually reducing it to stumps of foundation. But leftier souls may have preferred Volition's (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.
Well, Guerrilla's lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames's latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024. Here's the 1.0 trailer.

Many Stories, and it's a love letter to one of the best parts of Japan: convenience stores. No seriously, Japan's convenience stores, whether it's a local mom 'n pop place, Lawson's (best chicken), Family Mart (best desserts), or 7-Eleven (best egg salad sandos), entering one of these is a treat. 
As someone who just got back from a vacation in Japan, I'm heavily missing these stores, conveniently located everywhere throughout major cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and elsewhere. Perhaps that's why InKonbini's reveal trailer has me so excited to play this team's first game; but the game itself looks great, too.

Originally only coming to PC, we can exclusively reveal that Kamaeru will also be hopping onto Nintendo Switch in 2024 — at the same time as the PC release. With beautiful watercolour visuals and a cute little premise, the game looks pretty irresistible if you like your faming sims, or a just a big frog lover.

Any conversation about great roguelites is incomplete without mentioning Dead Cells, the Castlevania-inspired game from developer Motion Twin. With its variety of biomes, massive armory of unlockable weapons, and breakneck combat, it's cemented itself as one of the best roguelites of all time. But after seven years of support, its development team is moving onto a new project that has the potential to be just as exciting: Windblown, an isometric roguelite with bright graphics and three-player co-op.


The game was revealed with a beautifully animated announcement trailer at last year's Game Awards ceremony, and while it showed brief snippets of gameplay, it left a lot to be desired. T…]]></summary>

In case you didn't know, a Minecraft movie is currently in production by Legendary Pictures, Mojang, and Vertigo Entertainment, with a current release date set for 4th April, 2025.
Directed by Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Masterminds), the movie will star the likes of Jason Mamoa, Danielle Brooks, and Jennifer Coolidge, while reuniting Hess with Jack Black after their work together on the 2006 comedy Nacho Libre. Information on Minecraft's plot is rather thin on the ground at the moment, but we do at least know that the movie will remain relatively faithful to the game's visual aesthetics.

Surprise record-setters like Palworld, which I don't especially like, Helldivers 2, which I rather enjoy, and now Content Warning, which I'm still figuring out. If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral "SpookTube" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. 
Each video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of "cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation" and "cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views". Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here's how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success.

Now, Episode 4 is out for viewing on Disney Plus, and it's clear what the team behind the series was alluding to: The 1992 Konami-developed beat 'em up arcade cabinet game, X-Men. 
We won't spoil the episode here, but in the teaser clip released yesterday, we see Jubilee and Roberto taking on Sentinel enemies in clear sidescroller beat 'em up fashion, and it looks awesome. Check it out for yourself below: 


If you enjoyed this clip, catching up on X-Men '97 is easy as there are only four episodes out so far. And even if you're not interested in this series, today's new episode is worth watching if you've ever gone hands-on with Konami's classic X-Men arcade cabinet.

While we've missed a handful on Nintendo platforms over the years (notably the lovely-looking 2008 reboot), the vast majority of entries are playable on Nintendo's consoles — a couple of them with multiple different ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake is "alive and well," according to Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch. He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. 
Last month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. 


Now, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. 
"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this," Karch told the publication. "It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations." 
That's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. 
For more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays. After that, check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes.

Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”
ZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast and curious.
Atari has today announced that its arcade-inspired racing game NeoSprint will be speeding off the early access start line and heading to Switch later this year.
This single-screen racer borrows a lot from Atari's Sprint arcade series with its top-down perspective (here a little more isometric, but you get the picture) and a focus on multiplayer. But Atari and developer Headless Chicken Games have added a handful of modern touches too, to keep things up to date.

That’s according to Insider Gaming, who were told by sources that ‘The Rogue Prince of Persia’, as the game is rumoured to be named, will first release in Steam early access. It’s reckoned to have been in development for the last four years or so, and supposedly came about after a talk between Evil Empire and Ubisoft at GDC 2019.

Credit to Arma developer's Bohemia Interactive, however. Their April 1st announcement was that the latest update for Arma Reforger was Tiny Wars, a game mode in which you controlled tiny toy Army Men as they waged war around a proportionally huge home. As ever, this isn't really a joke, but it also wasn't exactly a lie, because you can actually play Tiny Wars for real now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MechWarrior is a video game series that has been going strong since 1989, and was even a tabletop wargame before that. Clans, however, is the first time in a long time the video games have leaned into the universe's fiction in a big way. The single-player (or cooperative) campaign features a full narrative complete with cutscenes and characters, which is quite different from the recent entries which have primarily been focused on competitive online action.
Join Charles Harte and me as we take a look at gameplay for Clans, which is coming this year to consoles and PC.

It's worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they're limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere. The other fast-travel option is an expensive item called a ferrystone, whi…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-04-02T18:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, Embracer Group announced it was selling Gearbox Software to Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two for $460 million. Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.
In a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. 
"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience," says Gearbox as part of its statement. "The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games."
While Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  
Embracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal.

Brynn wields a magical cloak called the Mantle, which grants her power to manipulate the elements by channeling magic. A reactive world means she can explore by harnessing weather events such as a flash freeze to augment ice abilities and create bridges to open new paths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Keepsake's co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.
It's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like an aggressively competitive thane at a reindeer-piss guzzling contest, 2D tac-and-slash roguelite Sons Of Valhalla never lets up the pace for even a moment. Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.
Viking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, how was everyone’s long weekend? I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.
Alongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.

PO’ed, in which you play a Pissed Off space chef crash-landed on an alien world, was not the very first game I owned for my PS1, but it was certainly one of, and it left a very strong impression. Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens. If you’re as lost as I imagine anyone hearing of this for the first time might rightly be, here’s that trailer.

Did you know that European magpies are great mimics? Second only to the Northern Mockingbird, apparently, though many ornithologists contend that the Brown Thrasher is sorely overlooked. You certainly hear their vocal range when they squabble - I reckon somebody should train up a ChatGPT AI on their calls and no, stop it, I'm doing an anecdote!
Those new PC game releases, without any further ado about birds: Minish Cap-esque shmup Minishoot Adventures (2nd April); Cuban fantasy metroidvania Saviorless (2nd April); culinary defence game Kitchen Crisis (3rd April); Dorfromantikal world builder Planetiles (3rd April); rhythmic robo-dystopian roguelike Beat Slayer (4th April); 90s biker's delight BMX Streets (5th April).

It has a fascinating and unique style set in a well-realized future where a portion of humanity has relocated to an underwater planet. It's a bit like Interstellar, but if things had gone how they were supposed to. Ahead of the game's release on April 16 (on Game Pass as well as other platforms), Charles Harte and I decided to take a look at an early portion of the game, discuss the developers' intentions for the narrative and gameplay, and detail how the game was made.
For a whole lot more on Harold Halibut, you can read this feature where I interviewed game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it's hot — enjoy!

CD Projekt Red are no stranger to releasing buggy games, but they're less keen on microtransactions - at least for singleplayer games. In an interview with a Polish investor site, CDPR's chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said that they "do not see a place for microtransactions in the case of singleplayer games", but they wouldn't rule it out for multiplayer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

This VR mech-fighting game has you pilot a giant mechanical gorilla, pummelling robots and human-controlled mechs with arms the length of lorries in grungy, trap-filled arenas. The combat alone is chest-thumpingly good, but Underdogs couples it with a fantastically evocative cyberpunk setting, and a smartly implemented rogue-like structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windowkill is the most inventive arcade shooter I've played for years.
It's twin-stick shooting in a tiny window that temporarily expands in that direction when you shoot its edges. You have to actively manage and maintain the play space itself for that to even be an option. Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you'll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.
It's a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.
I think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think its reasonable to say that the term ‘fetch quest’ is well passed the point of being a neutral descriptor and has moved firmly into the realm of full pejorative. You won't see many games tout ‘epic fetch quests’ on their Steam Page, and you’re much more likely to hear the term lodged between the words ‘not a bloody’ and ‘again’, like two slices of exasperation-enriched bread stuffed with a shit-tier filling. Cucumber, perhaps. Not so, at least not for me, when it comes to Dragon's Dogma 2. The action RPG game has more or less solved the fetch quest problem. All it took, it turns out, was some interesting world design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.
Nine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. 


The 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. 
Nine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.]]></summary>

What seems clear, however, is that in one form or another, these types of actions seem unlikely to go away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group has divested Gearbox Entertainment from its stable of video game studios, with Take-Two Interactive purchasing the company for $460 million. This sale is part of Embracer’s massive, ongoing restructuring designed to cut costs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The sale comes three years after Embracer acquired Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. 
This move means Embracer no longer owns Gearbox’s development entities, such as Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec, nor franchises such as Borderlands/Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem. These assets will be acquired by Take-Two, which owns Rockstar Games and 2K, among other labels. Closing of the tr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A regular rogue's gallery of independent game developers - including the makers of Dead Cells, Slay The Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Spiritfarer, Terraria and V Rising - have clubbed together to run their own videogame showcase: the Triple-I Initiative. Initially screening on 10th April, it'll be a 45-minute, unhosted, back-to-back series of trailers, reveals and surprise game or demo releases, designed (as per the press release) "to highlight fan-favorite games and hype up established indie classics as well as new IPs". It could become a yearly thing, but that'll obviously depend on how well the first showcase goes down.


According to a few of the organisers, the IIIIs - as they shall now and forever be known - reflect a high level of anxiety even among more established indie teams about finding an audience, together with a feeling that they aren't being served by existing showcases like the Geoffies, with their blockbuster headliners, celebrity cameos and extended Kojima soliloquies.

Ever the afterthought, Generals has shimmered between abandonware and temporarily available in some obscure place with no fanfare (I think? I honestly lost track) for years, but it's now available in a bundle on Steam as part of whatever needlessly awkward thing EA are doing this month. There's suddenly an opportunity to get into why its design and atmosphere make it probably my favourite of the whole collection, and why I wish I could say that without adding that it indulges in a lot of boring early-00s racism.

This isn't a formal announcement as much as a businessblast to hype shareholders, so it didn't have anything specific to say about what Gearbox are up to with their wildly popular and deeply unfunny looter shooter series. It had seemed curious that the much-delayed Borderlands movie was coming out five years after the latest main series game and with no new one in sight.

Sometimes, all it takes to get started on a great game is to come up with a compelling mechanic, and Pepper Grinder is a prime example. The titular grinder is as powerful as it is versatile, able to drill through the ground and power all sorts of wacky devices. The difficulty curve can be choppy, and ends more quickly than it should, but that core mechanic builds a sturdy foundation that kept me entertained from start to finish. 
That core mechanic is, of course, the Grinder, a conical drilling device protagonist Pepper uses to burrow through terrain, spin switches, and defeat ene…]]></summary>

We at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast think this is a good thing, in broad terms, and we discuss why (but also hope Joel is allowed holidays), as well as the response the community of players has had, which is also very interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pepper Grinder is one of those games that has so many great moments in it that recounting them would almost feel unfair to anyone hoping to play it. There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is. Rather than outstay its welcome, Pepper Grinder shows up, performs its party trick, then gets the hell out of the way, leaving you to bask in the warm glow of a good game well done.

We've had a couple of successful outings over the years with the likes of Death's Door and Hollow Knight and company, but anything with pure FromSoft blood running through its veins has always left me cold. Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the 'git gud' camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It's all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you're finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It's all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that's just launched on Steam, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go if you're feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.

Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It's a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I've started a new character who'll never learn skills or get a good gun. She's quite bad, and that's quite fun.

Once a tentpole franchise in the popular run-and-gun subgenre of action games, Contra has experienced a stark downturn in recent decades. Konami's (mostly) side-scrolling shooter franchise has often gone long stretches without a release, and the games that have come out in recent years range from middling to downright bad. With Contra: Operation Galuga, Konami taps renowned retro-style developer WayForward, best known for its work on the Shantae series, to bring the once-renowned series back to its roo…]]></summary>

Earthblade was first announced in April 2021 before getting its first trailer at The Game Awards in 2022. The fantasy "explor-action" platformer stars Névoa, a child of fate who returns to uncover the mysteries of a fractured Earth. The game appears to be inspired by the Metroidvania subgenre, with the studio stating it features "seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley, one of our favourite RPGs despite coming out almost a decade ago, still has an attentive steward in the form of developer Eric Barone. After the recent 1.6 mega-update to the game, which added a whole bunch of stuff, Barone (better known in his developer form as ConcernedApe) Xeeted out a list of fixes in the now-available 1.6.3 update. This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing 'excess trash' to be fished.
Importantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don't have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie's. This is lovely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer have announced that they're selling Borderlands developers Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive, owners of 2K Games and GTA 6 developers Rockstar, for $460 million in Take-Two shares. Three Gearbox Software studios - the flagship studio in Texas, together with Gearbox Montréal and Gearbox Quebec - will change hands as part of the deal. Take-Two will also acquire the Borderlands and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands franchises, together with Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem.


Embracer will keep and rename Gearbox Publishing San Francisco, previously known as Perfect World Entertainment. They're also hanging onto Cryptic Studios, who went through a round of layoffs in November, together with their MMOs Neverwinter Online and Star Trek Online. They're also clinging onto Borderlands 3 support studio Lost Boys Interactive, who went through a round of layoffs in January, plus 3D scanning and reconstruction outfit Captured Dimensions. Last but not least, they'll keep the publishing rights to the Remnant series, Hyper Light Breaker and "other notable unannounced game releases".

        <updated>2024-03-27T21:47:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2020, indie studio Yellow Brick Games was formed by a collection of industry veterans with experience on triple-A franchises such as Dragon Age, Assassins’ Creed, and Mass Effect. After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.
The studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. 


The studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.

Yellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a "people first" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, "deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine."
"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not every March-released, fantastical action-RPG will fall to bits on the Steam Deck. Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition succeeds where Dragon’s Dogma 2 spluttered, quietly yet capably adapting to handheld hardware. Keeping performance up requires a fair bit of fine-tuning the graphics settings, and a girthsome install size might trouble the internal drives of smaller models, but otherwise, Forbidden West is just as portable-friendly as Horizon Zero Dawn. And that’s still one of the best Steam Deck games around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went into Open Roads pretty cold, knowing only that it was a story-driven road trip game with some element of mystery to it. The mystery is really just a backdrop, though - a device to better bring forth the themes of family and secrets. Most specifically it's about mother-daughter relationships, as we join single mum Opal and her sixteen-year-old daughter Tess on a short (from our point of view) but bittersweet road trip when, going through Opal's mother's home post-funeral, they discover she may have had an affair decades before. Can you ever really know the people you love? Does it matter? If you left your daughter's early-00s flip phone back at the motel, would you turn around and lose four hours, or hope it's still there on the way back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of decades ago there was a period when all videogames and especially all Unreal Engine videogames had to be brown and grey and dingy. "The Gears of Warrification of graphics," we used to call it, huddled up in the chest-high trenches with our Xbox 360 controllers. Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. 


Developers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.

It’s not a competition, mind, but they’d surely be a strong contender if it were. Despite dropping the Omega update just last month, and unveiling fantasy survival game Light No Fire at last year’s Geoffies, the team are back once more with the Orbital update. It looks to be a sizeable one too, with ship customisation and a “complete space station overhaul” among the new features. You can read the full patch notes here. I hope it includes a note about how much sleep they’re all getting, because I’m starting to worry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Herbert Spencer coined the phrase "survival of the fittest" to describe Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory, I'm pretty sure he didn't envisage the rise of a species of videogame, the survival sim, which would one day itself suffer an unsustainable population explosion during the layoff-ridden years of 2023 and 2024. What does it take to survive as a survival sim, in these days when every other game seems to be a survival sim? What separates the fit from the extinct? If you're Palworld, the answer is gleefully borrowing and travestying monster concepts from a celebrated Nintendo series. If you're Enshrouded, it's all about having a really neat building system. And if you're Dune: Awakening, the next game from Conan Exiles developer Funcom, the trick may lie with sandworms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the good works of Calvin Klein, these genes come pre-distressed. Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.
This look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.

Google tells me the main consensus is that stones are just smaller rocks, which sounds like a flimsy distinction to base a catchphrase on. I’m not sure when this would come up, unless maybe you were a biblical heretic trying to dunk on the people bludgeoning you to death by correcting them in some last gasp pettiness, but it still bothers me. Anyway, colony survival game First Dwarf cares not for rock, only stone, along with the wood you’ll use as the building blocks of your colonies. This is me burying the lede deeper than the mines of Moria, of course, because First Dwarf also has a tiny talking dragon companion that sits on the shoulder of the giant dwarven mech you use to swing a hammer at horrible toxic shitlizards. The dragon learnt your language by sneaking herself in a library. Do go on, game.

Said game is apparently a change of genre from Failbetter's previous, exceedingly narrative-driven open world titles and free-to-play RPGs. It'll also be a little less oppressive, aiming for a feeling of "fireside menace" - that is, "an awareness of the world's dangers, but also warmth and comfort", which certainly feels like an appropriate mood for a time of mass layoffs and game cancellations, to say nothing of recent conspiracy-fuelled harassment campaigns.

Go-gettin', arrow-shootin' warrior Aloy managed to delay the end of the world in Horizon Zero Dawn, but the death train is still chugging along to all life on Earth station via a (currently resonant) eco-disaster. In Horizon Forbidden West it's because the AI created to heal the planet from the prior extinction event caused by humans isn't working properly. Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy's job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions. But nobody turned off the making robots button, which means this action RPG in a massive open-world still involves fighting rocket-launcher T-rexes. It'll shock no one that this makes for a very good video game.

The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven't played it, have I, so I'll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.
Not least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now.

On April 18th, The Crew Motorfest will arrive on Steam after several months available via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft's own launcher, providing a new venue to buy the third entry in the series. Or perhaps that should be "rent".

Nine repositories claim to contain everything from the front end, data models, storage and filesystem, through to the platform's API and internal documentation. Presented with a manifesto of sorts, the unknown leaker claims that Piracy Shield "isn't just a failed attempt to combat online piracy," it's a "dangerous gateway" to censorship "disguised as a solution to piracy."

It wasn’t until 2021, however, that we got our first proper look at Stellar Blade during a PlayStation showcase, where it was shown with its former title, Project Eve.
For those not paying close attention to Korean video game news, it felt like it came out of nowhere. In the trailer, a beautiful woman is seen fighting a hybrid monster robot. She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along. As she careens through space further and further away from the station, it is revealed that a much …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it's no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.
Thirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.
The relevant section says, "Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure."
There's really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there's no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft's private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find myself increasingly turned off these days by simulations that boast of endless butterfly effects. I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to "a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it's 1000 metres in extent". Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?


Still, I'm very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it's the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based "immersive experiences" and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it's a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it's inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet "secret cities" given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn't make the last bus out of town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news for people who don’t cringe violently every time they encounter the phrase “Narrative Legos”! We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it's an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different," says Levine. 


Judas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness.

While the game itself is enjoyable to most, it launched with microtransactions that provide in-game currency, as well as a litany of technical issues for some players. Today, Capcom outlined some of its plans to update the game in the "near future," but specifically notes that improvements to frame rate will come in later patches. That said, these quick fixes are still useful.
In addition to general text and bug fixes, there are a few significant quality-of-life improvements. For starters, the Pawn Guild now sells a lot more "Art of Metamorphosis" items, which is how you can change the appearance of a character or pawn after they've already been created.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
