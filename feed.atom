If you’re escaping a dystopian prison system where you can pay to upgrade to invisible handcuffs, your escape may as well have a jamming soundtrack. But you'll have to bring your own, because the world in Keylocker hates that stuff. Like in Footloose, music is an illegal activity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't forget to bring a towel
THQ Nordic has revealed that work has begun on a brand new South Park game. The currently untitled release was teased at the end of Friday's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2022 live stream.
Outside of the above sentence, there is literally nothing to be said regarding the release. The couldn't be simpler teaser merely consisted of a flash of the South Park Digital Studios logo, complete with a sample of rad dad Randy Marsh screaming "HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT!".
Y'know, from that episode where he did a giant turd... or something.
No gameplay footage, platforms, nor a release window were revealed, and we do not know whether the new game will continue in the point-and-click, turn-based battle tradition of THQ Nordic's previous releases South Park: The Stick of Truth (2014) and its sequel South Park: The Fractured but Whole (2017). At this point, perhaps the only thing we can guarantee is that Stan and the boys' newest adventure will probably give global censors plenty of troubled nights.
The new South Park game is currently in development at South Park Digital Studios for THQ Nordic. You can check out a VoD edition of the full THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2022 presentation right here.

Last week saw Xenoblade Chronicles 3 take a tumble from its top spot after a record-breaking opening to fall into the 10th position on the UK charts, and this week has been no easier for Monolith Soft's massive JRPG.
Slipping out of the top 10 completely, Xenoblade's departure has left a gap which has interestingly been filled by Sega and Two Point Studios' Two Point Campus. After a strong opening week across all consoles, Two Point Campus takes the number two spot on the UK charts this week — thanks in large part to the stellar Switch release which accounts for a huge 64% of the game's sales. Here's a look at the split across all consoles:

The trailer, which contains far more "skit" than it does "gameplay" sees veteran announcer Tony Schiavone settle on the couch with the inimitable Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D, (I hope y'all did the little hand gesture), as the duo (pretend to) battle it out in All Elite Wrestling's console debut. We don't really get to see much of the game in action, frankly, but we do see Baker apply the lockjaw to her beau Adam Cole. before laying in a beating with a selection of weapons, including bins and fire extinguishers.

Revealed for Switch back in July, publisher Finji is bringing Northway Games' I Was a Teenage Exocolonist to Nintendo's console (and others) on 25th August. A narrative RPG with card-based battles, it sees you growing up in an off-world colony, with all the hardship that brings in addition to the more familiar and typical difficulties associated with navigating your teenage years into adulthood.
It's a coming-of-age "sci-fi life sim" with card-based bits, then, but one which doesn't shy away from mature themes and seems to gently reflect some of the existential crises we're increasingly facing in the real world, albeit in a cosier, less unremittingly bleak manner than the many and various survival game press releases that drop into our inbox on a weekly basis.

With Splatoon 3, however, it seems Nintendo may have taken a bigger step in the direction of diversity and representation. As part of its recent Direct Presentation, it was revealed that a new trio called 'Deep Cut' would be handling the in-game news items, replacing the 'Squid Sisters' from Splatoon 1 and Pearl and Marina from the last game. The group consists of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, with the former proving to be a popular talking point amongst fans, many of whom believe that Shiver may be Nintendo's first major non-binary character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindhack, an upcoming visual novel adventure, opens in a jail cell, as a criminal named Unid is brought before you by a pair of armed security guards. Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

Genshin Impact 3.0 is nearly here, and miHoYo just spilled all the details, including the release date!
What's in Genshin Impact 3.0?
As a major expansion of sorts, 3.0 will add the new Sumeru region into the mix, and will likely force players into new conflicts with the Fatui. Here are the core tenets of what you're getting day one, plus all the updates that will follow in the 3.0 line:
A Dendro moveset unlock for the Traveler
Tighnari (new Dendro character)
Collei (new Dendro character)
Dori (new Electro character)
The Sumeru region
New items
An extension of the Archon (main) story quest
When does Genshin Impact 3.0 launch?
We got that info too! Studio miHoYo has confirmed that it will launch on August 24. We'll also get updates on September 28, November 2, and December 7, so the cadence is a little earlier than usual (one week earlier, each).
As a reminder, Genshin Impact 2.0 (which brought the Inazuma region to the table) came out on July 20, 2021, so we're just over a year out since the last major "expansion-sized" update.
What are the Genshin Impact 3.0 freebie codes?
Note that these codes are expiring this morning, but have been posted for posterity.
8ANCKTWYVRD5: 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore | 100 Primogems
KT7DKSFGCRWD: 50,000 Mora | 100 Primogems
EA7VKTFHU9VR: Hero’s Witx5 | 100 Primogems
Remember in the future that you can redeem your codes in-game, or right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

After nine long years in development, developer DeskWorks has created what can only be described as a perfect embodiment of when imagination takes over with RPG Time: The Legend Of Wright. Spilling colour, nostalgia, and a little bit of childlike glee onto the pages of a notebook, this is a heartwarming tale of two friends at the end of a school day and a humorous take on a heroic adventure.
The story is set out by Kenta, a ten-year-old aspiring game developer with unmatched ingenuity. The construction of Cardboardia, alongside a cast of unforgettable characters, resides on the desk in a classroom, and each element of the game adopts a lovingly handmade appearance. Comprised of puppets, cardboard cutouts, and some pretty incredible origami, Kenta is keen to share the tale of Wright with the player from the moment you boot up the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus finally launched into 1.0 after weeks of beta testing, and while the launch was quite smooth, Player First Games opted to delay Season 1. 
However, that brief delay is behind us as Season 1 begins today and you can check out the patch notes detailing every character buff, nerf, and more here. Alongside today’s patch notes, though, came a small leak from Player First Games and MultiVersus itself. Twitter user _FireMonkey booted up MultiVersus and saw a Season 1 startup loading screen a bit too early, as reported by Eurogamer. That’s because this startup screen featured two characters not yet revealed for the roster: Stripe, the antagonist from Gremlins, and Black Adam. 
Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see in the screenshot above, it seems Black Adam and Stripe will be joining the roster sometime in Season 1. Black Adam makes sense – Warner Bros. and DC (and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson for that matter) are in full marketing mode for Black Adam. Stripe, however, is more of a curveball. It’s an awesome inclusion, but also a somewhat random one.
For more, read Game Informer’s MultiVersus review, and then check out this story about the upcoming release of Morty from Rick and Morty. Read about every character buff, nerf, and more in Season 1 after that.

An Xbox dashboard advert appears to have jumped the gun a little early, and has apparently leaked two new characters who are in line to join the chaotic crossover brawler MultiVersus. The ad, which quickly became widespread on social media, points to the two newcomers being DC anti-hero Black Adam and Stripe, the malevolent antagonist of Joe Dante's 1984 horror-comedy, Gremlins.
https://twitter.com/IronWolfNet_/status/1559045986156089344?s=20&t=s8OORNqs-xQfHhE6_en-Ag
Debuting way back in 1945, and under the license of Fawcett Comics, Black Adam was an arch enemy of Shazam! (then still "Captain Marvel"). Originally an ancient Egyptian predecessor of Shazam, DC Comics has readapted Black Adam time and again as a frequent villain, sometime anti-hero, and othertime straight hero. Perhaps one of the single most alliance-jumping characters in comic book history, Black Adam will soon make his big-screen debut in a new movie, portrayed by Dwayne Johnson.
Stripe is the closest Gremlins has to an antagonist, given the character's nature as the self-appointed alpha of the mischievous monsters. A clone of good guy Mogwai Gizmo, birthed after the latter was splashed with water, Stripe leads his brethren on a Christmas rampage through the town of Kingston Falls, afforded a disgusting new form after tricking owner Billy Peltzer into feeding him after midnight.
You're already singing the theme tune, aren't you?
MultiVersus open beta is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can check out the official season one patch notes, complete with their respective nerfs and buffs, on the official website.

That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

As a part of Kirby's 30th anniversary celebrations, Nintendo Dream magazine recently sat down with the games' director, Shinya Kumazaki, for an all-inhaling conversation about the character's Switch outings. In this interview (thanks to Nintendo Everything for the English translation excerpt), Kumazaki stated that they conceived of Star Allies as 'laying the groundwork' for future Kirby titles:

I remember being intrigued while watching my old roommate play through Hybrid Heaven. In my younger days, I had rented it and written it off for a reason I think is perfectly valid: all the environments look the same. Watching him play through it didn’t prove otherwise. Hybrid Heaven is metallic corridors from eyebrows to toe-hairs. But something about the way he was enjoying it was infectious.
After he completed it, he told me that “he probably wouldn’t have tolerated it without save states.” That is not glowing praise, but the experience was enough to keep Hybrid Heaven rolling around in my head for years until I finally found it for a reasonable price. By now, the game has been built up in my mind that I almost had to play through the entire thing. Good or bad.

In case you didn't know, tomorrow (Monday, August 15th) marks the 35th Anniversary of Metroid's NES launch in North America. That's insane, right? 35 years! Do you feel old yet?
In the years and decades since its debut in 1987 ('86 in Japan), the Metroid franchise has gone on to become one of Nintendo's tentpole franchises, with games releasing on near enough every console bar the N64 and Wii U (Virutal Console doesn't count!). Despite earning somewhat lukewarm commerical success when compared to the likes of Super Mario and Animal Crossing, Metroid has more than earned its place in the hearts of Nintendo gamers worldwide; heck, you only need to look at some of the reactions to Nintendo's announcement of Metroid Prime 4 to appreciate just how impactful the franchise has become.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NeverEnding Story.
If “Kureshin × Bokunatsu” a) makes sense and b) sounds appealing to you, and if c) you haven’t already bought this game in the year since it was released in Japan, then we can keep this review nice and tight: buy this game! For those not residing in that modest nub of the Venn diagram, let’s see if you’ve moved there by the end of the page.
So let’s start with the “making sense” bit. “Kureshin” is the Japanese shortened name for Crayon Shin-chan, a manga series and anime sitcom about a two-kids-and-a-dog Japanese family, focused on Shinnossuke (Shin-chan), their impish five-year-old. It’s been running since 1990 and uses a distinctively wonky art style, a long way from the wet-eyed haircuts grimacing against strobing parallax some exported anime brings to mind. Shin-chan spends his time infuriating his parents, causing arguments, leaping into wild make-believe, repenting and making up, in a neat loop of boisterous hyperactivity and happy sentimentality.

If there is one thing my Apple Arcade subscription has taught me over the past few years, it’s that games designed around gacha mechanics don’t necessarily have to be the type of whale-hunting monstrosities that result in terrible YouTube “influencers” bragging about how they can’t play anybody online anymore because they spent $100,000 in it. Games like World of Demons and Star Trek: Legends are enjoyable gacha games in part because you don’t have menus popping up constantly goading you into dropping cash in them. With that monetary incentive removed from these titles, players are free to enjoy the actual gameplay without worrying they’ll miss out on something huge if they don’t buy a loot box or start a game-specific subscription service.

Narrative games may be a small niche within the gaming industry as a whole, but there’s an even smaller subsection of the genre that a lot of gamers don’t know about: interactive fiction also known as IF. With the exception of some UI upgrades or a musical score, the vast majority of IF is just simple text on a screen that the player clicks through. It exists in the space between my two favorite things: literature and video games. Technically interactive fiction got its start in the late 1970s with text adventures like Zork, but now the world of text-based games has taken on a whole new life.
I’ve always dabbled in the world of IF, but when I came across this thread on Twitter, it reminded me that the community surrounding this genre is mo…]]></summary>

Nintendo has been slowly but surely fleshing out its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service with new DLC content for games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and also by bolstering its retro libraries with plenty of classic titles.
Knowing this could be a tad overwhelming for some players at this point, it's now uploaded a guide on how exactly to redeem and download paid DLC when your Switch Online membership is active. Apart from the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Booster Course Pass, you can see it's also highlighted Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion as well as the N64 app.

Right from the get-go, there was a wide variety of reactions to Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. The copious "chaos!" exclamations in the reveal were definitely a driving factor in that divide, but as I dug into the game at launch, I found a lot to like, including some of the bolder and somewhat out-there choices with the narrative.
We sat down recently with director Daisuke Inoue and producer Jin Fujiwara to really take in the game's impact thus far, and where it might be going now that the DLC campaign is underway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie has been permitted to seek overseas cooperation under the Hague Convention to obtain evidence on a Destiny 2 cheat seller. The developer filed a copyright lawsuit against the alleged operator of Lavicheats in 2021 but almost a year later progress is slow. In addition to conducting discovery in the US, Bungie has an eye on the UK but whether that will bear fruit is another question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hopefully it lives up to the series' potential
Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most beloved TV series of all time (and for good reason), and it's about damn time it got another video game adaptation. This week Square Enix and Navigator Games announced that they're collaborating on an Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game for Android and iOS, which is launching in Canada, South Africa, and Sweden this month ahead of a wider release.
The game, titled Avatar: Generations, will be a free-to-play RPG that will include squad-based battles and in-game adventure sequences (whatever that means), according to GameSpot. Players will be able to explore an open world, as well as relive iconic story moments from the show as well. We can also expect to see all of our favorite characters like Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, Zuko, Appa, and Momo. Future updates will give players access to Avatar Kyoshi, Korra, Roku, and explore all four of the nations.

Square Enix and Navigator put up an official website for the Avatar: Generations, although it's basically empty as of now, so it's worth coming back to in a bit when they release more information. There's also no hint as to when the full release of Generations might be, but considering it's a mobile launch, odds are it won't take as long as the typical game releases we're used to.
I'm honestly shocked that the games industry hasn't given ATLA more love up until this point, considering how big and enthusiastic the fanbase is. I'm sure most of us would prefer a full AAA treatment over an Avatar mobile game, but it's a good place to start.
There have certainly been some good mobile games based on bigger franchises in the past few years — Fallout Shelter being chief among them. Hopefully if Generations does well, some of the bigger studios will catch on to the potential that this franchise has to make some really kickass games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut.

The Two Point County Cinematic Universe (TPCCU) excites me. Two Point Studios launched Two Point Hospital with the intent of building a landscape where all their future games would happen. Two Point Campus is the next step. It’s not a sequel, but the aesthetics, the characters, and even the UI call back to their first title. It reminds me of Maxis in the ‘90s before and directly after EA got their evil all over them. A lot of the games sprung up around SimCity, and while not all of them were as directly related as the ones from Two Point Studios, some were tied together, even if it was just in a reference.
I’ve been eagerly waiting for the next step in the Two Point experience. Actually, I’ve been waiting for the next few steps.…]]></summary>

The heat's back, and we're desperately trying to stay indoors here at Nintendo Life. We've got a round-up of everything that was shown off in the Splatoon 3 Nintendo Direct! Also, were feeling a bit peckish after Kirby's Dream Buffet got a release date. And there's a beautiful hand-drawn Metroidvania featuring cats coming to Switch later this month!
Speaking of Splatoon 3, some of us on the team were a bit worried about the upcoming sequel, but this Direct may have alleviated our worries. We spoke to the team behind indie hit Cult of the Lamb and poked fun at the 'evil Animal Crossing' comparisons. And, apparently, liking Krookodile makes this writer a big crocodile fan (not denying it) — but what does your favourite Pokémon say about you?

Hey guys! Some big Twitch stream requests recently have been Cult of the Lamb, Lamentum, a few horror sequels, and horror-adjacent games like Martha is Dead.
I decided to go with Martha today because if we're lucky, we can get through most if not all of it, whereas the other ones will take at least two streams. I'm still interested in Cult of the Lamb, though, so we'll likely see that soon.

Some of you described Martha is Dead as a gripping and atmospheric psychological thriller, which is exactly a part of what we like here, so I'll see you tonight to check it out!

The next game from the creators of Owlboy is as conceptually wacky as it is gorgeous. D-Pad Studio has formally announced Vikings On Trampolines, an up-to-four-player game with co-op adventuring, battling, and boss fighting. Whatever you do, don't stop bouncing.

The start to a new year at Hogwarts will be slightly delayed. Open-world magic RPG Hogwarts Legacy has hit a new delay, and is now aiming for a February 10, 2023 launch.
It's the latest 2022 game to get hit with a delay into next year, and it comes with an addendum too. While the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions of Hogwarts Legacy are set for February 10, 2023, the Nintendo Switch version has no date. News about the Switch's date will be revealed soon, the Hogwarts team says.

It's the latest delay for Avalanche Software's game, which had already been pushed out of 2021 and into this year. We did get a gameplay deep dive earlier this year, where we saw a bit of what wizards and witches can get up to in the wizarding world. But it looks like players will be waiting a bit longer to get their owl.
Back to school
The delay isn't totally out of the ordinary, as several major 2022 games have been moving out and into later dates. Earlier this week, Firaxis and 2K confirmed that Marvel's Midnight Suns has been delayed out of its October date, only specifying that it will launch sometime before the end of March '23.
Even Metal Slug Tactics is taking a little extra time. Only a few, like God of War Ragnarok, are standing firm in this coming holiday window.
A little extra time will hopefully at least be good for the team, in helping them deliver the experience they want to. I'm admittedly not too keen on Hogwarts Legacy, especially as it's based on a series whose author seems determined to keep chipping away at any goodwill the books garnered. WB Games did note in 2020 that Rowling isn't directly involved in the game. But hey. There's always Witchbrook.

Street Fighter 6 may still be at least six months away, but you wouldn't know from the way Capcom has been rolling out the trailers, theme songs, show demos, and character reveals since the fighter's official announcement. And for many people, (yer boy Moyse included), the legendary developer has done an amazing job at keeping the hype engines running on overdrive.
Every trailer, every roster reveal, and every playtest report, only heightens my anticipation for SF6. As regular readers will know, I've been playing fighting games since 1990.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

Ever wanted to find a home on a distant planet? Well, Space for Sale will let you explore a planet and build one for others, even with a pal. Just be ready for a little risk and danger.
Space for Sale is a new building and management sim game from Mirage Game Studios, the makers of Little Big Workshop. Revealed at today's THQ Nordic showcase, the goal of Space for Sale is to land on distant planets, spot good plots for new estates, and flip them for massive profit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36zqJyOBCqA
Of course, the local wildlife is not too keen on you turning their natural habitat into a trendy downtown district. As you build up, it looks like you'll need to also keep an eye out for danger. The local flora and fauna can be tamed and researched though, eventually leading to breakthroughs on how to thrive in these biomes.
Building a new neighborhood
Space for Sale will let you explore procedurally generated landscapes, discovering natural resources to harvest and turn into estates. Establishing power lines and construction areas is important, as is satisfying the customers.
Drop-in, drop-out multiplayer will also make it easy for a friend to hop and help construct that new living area alongside you. Everything's a bit easier to do with more hands, right?

Honestly, Space for Sale looks like a really fun time. I dig the mix of survival elements and home design, and having to build a nice little home in a world that actively wants you gone. Space for Sale seems ripe for co-op hijinx and plenty of goofs in trying to make some homes on a dangerous planet.
No firm date has been set yet, but Space for Sale is coming soon to PC. You can find the Steam store page here.

Partway through today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, which is low-key giving me old silly Konami E3 vibes, we got an updated look at Gothic 1 Remake. The 2001 role-playing game is coming back on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and whether you're in or not will likely depend on your connection to the original back in the day — or maybe a fascination with of-their-time games returning with glossed-up remasters or remakes.
Here's a cinematic trailer to (re)introduce the mining colony and the Minecrawlers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf4Wd29mRqw
Players will "manage the fate of a lifetime convicted prisoner who must survive in a world of wild animals, creatures, and convicts of dangerous reputation."
Game developer Alkimia Interactive promises a "modernized combat system" for Gothic 1 Remake, though it hopes to retain an overall "faithful" vibe. That's a tricky balancing act for any revival, especially one with a cult following. 20 years can be an eternity in gaming.
In December 2019, THQ Nordic released a Gothic Playable Teaser on Steam, which generated no shortage of fan feedback to take into consideration. As a first introduction, it arguably missed the mark. But as a public test, I think it served its purpose.
Despite this latest promotional push, Gothic 1 Remake doesn't have a release date. It's still tagged with a vague "coming soon" on Steam, and will also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S — when it's ready. The slow but steady burn continues.
THQ Nordic sure has an interesting collection of games these days.

A horror series is getting a new lease on life under THQ Nordic. Alone in the Dark, a "reimagination" of the '90s cult-classic survival horror game, is in development.
The game was revealed today as part of the THQ Nordic showcase, showing off the setting, gameplay, and more. Pieces Interactive is heading up development, as part of THQ Nordic under the Embracer Group umbrella.
Alone in the Dark will return to the Derceto Manor, with an original story that will still feature some characters and themes from the '90s trilogy.
Players can once again play as either Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood. Levels and cutscenes will change, depending on which character you're controlling at that moment in time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acch6-3QEWs
Pieces Interactive will try to capture a gothic American South look, mixed in with noir, the Roaring '20s, and Lovecraftian horror. Mikael Hedberg, the writer behind Soma and Amnesia, is on board to pen the story for Alone in the Dark.
You are not alone (in the dark)
Details about the new game leaked out early today, ahead of the official reveal. While some of the wind was taken out of the sails there, it does seem like people are eager to see what Alone in the Dark will do with this second wind.

Remakes and reimaginings have gone pretty well for the survival horror genre as well. At least, they have for Resident Evil, which has been seeing steady remakes of many of its numbered games, with Resident Evil 4 due up next.
Alone in the Dark, meanwhile, has toiled in the shadows for a while. It hasn't seen a new entry since 2015's Alone in the Dark: Illumination, which was not very well-received. Even the entry before it didn't go quite so well.
A return to the roots of the series might be what Alone in the Dark needs. We'll see if Pieces and THQ can deliver it.

If you feeling a little lacking in Hyperdimension Neptunia goodness, then you'll be pleased to hear that Idea Factory has announced recent spin-off Sisters VS Sisters will be getting a western localization in 2023. The most recent chapter in the Neptunia series launched in Japan back in April of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwExZrrgrk
Hyperdimension Neptunia: Sisters VS Sisters sees the land of Gameindustri besieged by an oppressive new force, known as the "Trendi Outbreaks." Guided by the release of a powerful new mobile phone, known as the "rPhone" — all the subtlety of a fucking brick through a window — it is up to NepGear and her friends to restore peace and order to both Planeptune and GameIndustri at large. But with many of the kingdom's more powerful goddesses away on another assignment, do NepGear and her pals have what it takes to save the day alone?
Sisters VS Sisters will see the player lead a team of Neptunia superstars into battle against the Trendi Phenomenon. Defeat enemies, level up and evolve your heroes, learn new moves, combos, and chain attacks, and take on an array of sub-missions discovered through the popular social media website "Chirper." Of course, fans can also look forward to a lot of fun comedic dialogue, a heavy emphasis on character accessorization, unlockable characters, and the obligatory photo mode.
Hyperdimension Neptunia: Sisters VS Sisters launches in 2023 on PlayStation and PC platforms.

Two Fallout 76 bonus events are nearly upon us, thanks to a convention, and a series of unfortunate events that led to extra maintenance.
Double XP is happening because of QuakeCon weekend
So from August 18 through August 22, you can net double XP for Fallout 76 in celebration of QuakeCon, which I totally forgot is happening soon. As per usual, the bonus works for any game mode.
As a reminder, QuakeCon is not live in person this year — instead, it's happening digitally. Bethesda has planned "new streaming programming, online meetups, giveaways, charity opportunities, the virtual BYOC, and more." It also promises that it's "committed" to an in-person event in 2023.
Double SCORE (season pass XP) is also live now until August 16 at 12PM PT
In a slightly more complicated situation, Fallout 76 encountered some issues earlier this week in terms of maintenance. Bethesda notes that it "ran quite a bit longer than we had originally anticipated," and as a result, they're doing the classic "you get a bonus, and you get a bonus" thing to make up for it.
So, everyone can earn double SCORE, which essentially amounts to season pass leveling XP. The promo is live now, and will run through August 16 at 12PM ET.
It's a nice string of Fallout 76 bonus events for those of you who play regularly as you'll essentially be able to hop from one event to the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

In a month's time, the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan will open its doors to welcome the country's biggest annual gaming event, Tokyo Game Show (TGS). As is the style of the event, a wide variety of developers and publishers will be in attendance to spotlight their new and upcoming hardware and software releases to press and players.
Getting a little ahead of the game, developer Capcom has offered up a teaser of some of the titles that it will be bringing to TGS 2022. Available to play on-site will be upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6, strategy compendium Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, recent adventure expansion Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, and Capcom's still-in-development din smasher Exoprimal, which will launch at some point in 2023.
In addition to the floor demos, Capcom has two digital presentations planned for the weekend. September 15 will see Capcom featured as part of the "Tokyo Game Show 2022 Capcom Online Program," which will feature news and updates pertaining to all of the TGS-featured games. September 16 will feature a special Street Fighter 6-centric presentation. While details remain under wraps, I would not be surprised if we do not get further character and gameplay reveals for the highly anticipated sequel.
Tokyo Game Show 2022 will take place September 15-18 in Chiba, Japan. We will be sure to report all of the hottest news and reveals from the event right here on Destructoid.

After encountering hundreds of Yiga clan members in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I never really thought twice about them. Well, justlookingfordragon did!
Amazingly, the entire exercise is framed as a self-imposed mission, as many Breath of the Wild activities often are. In this case, they opted to take photos of the Yiga clan imposters they find out on their travels, then track them down based on those photos. As they point out, "none of the Yiga impersonate 'important' characters: most are just wandering people with a couple lines of random dialogue." This actually kind of fits with the theme of just blinding in by taking an ordinary person's identity.

Zelda: Breath of the Wild Yiga clan mystery solved
It turns out justlookingfordragons also seemingly figured out better ways to spot the Yiga imposters. They actually only double as Hylians or Hylian-adjacent races (which might be something you already noticed, but is nice to get confirmation on after all this research), and never take the identity of a child or an older resident (or any other race).
They even provided a helpful map (above) for spotting stationary Breath of the Wild Yiga clan members — and you can save and load using a campfire to reset them. If you're remotely interested in how the Yiga clan operates, the breakdown is worth the full read. Hopefully they return in the sequel!

Veteran Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi has announced that they have left the Resident Evil and Street Fighter developer to take a new role at the Chinese conglomerate NetEase. Kobayashi shared the news with friends, fans, and followers on Twitter earlier today, which just so happens to be the producer's 50th birthday.
"I would like to share something very special with everyone," began Kobayashi. "After serving 27 years with gratitude, I have departed from Capcom on March 31st and will officially be joining NetEase Games as a producer. I will strive to continuously create more enjoyable entertainment experiences for everyone at this new company, in this new era. Thank you for your continued support."
https://twitter.com/HiroKobaP/status/1557895229021118464?s=20&t=JvBOIN8mOUhnj9NNktzWaQ
In the near-three decades spent with Capcom, Kobayashi has worked alongside some of the company's most successful and recognizable brands. Kobayashi started out as a key coder for the groundbreaking survival horror title Resident Evil, with the following years seeing him rise through Capcom's ranks as a planner, associate producer, and eventually executive producer on titles such as Dino Crisis, killer7, Devil May Cry, and the Sengoku Basara franchise.
Kobayashi's move to NetEase Games can be seen as another step in the studio's desire to become a bigger play both within the games industry and on the global stage. NetEase already works as a China-based partner to Activision Blizzard, and recently announced the opening of its first U.S.-based studio, Jackalope Games. NetEase Games has been searching for notable staff members over the past year, which included courting Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi. Nagoshi now operates his own studio as a NetEase subsidiary.

A new Pokemon special titled Arceus Chronicles is set to debut very soon, as The Pokemon Company already has a platform and date: September 23, 2022 on Netflix. Before that though, fans who are attending the 2022 Pokemon World Championships in London will be able to see it at a screening event at 6PM BST on August 19.
Here's the synopsis:
"A visit to the Sinnoh region turns into a high-stakes adventure when Ash, Pikachu, and friends join forces with powerful Pokemon to confront a looming threat! When Ash, Goh, and Dawn receive a mysterious message from the Mythical Pokemon Arceus, they meet up with Brock and head to Mount Coronet to investigate. There, they find a rampaging Heatran and the commanders of Team Galactic, who are determined to find their missing leader by opening a gate between dimensions."

I kind of love the idea of mining a previous region/generation for more story, just like the Pokemon Legends game did before. Given the immense success of Legends, I think there are more of those types of games in the pipeline as we speak. As for the animated tie-in, while I haven't kept up on every single episode of the long, long, long-running Pokemon series proper, I do generally watch all the films and specials — particularly the ones that are on YouTube for free. You can watch the trailer below and decide for yourself if you want to partake!

I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Metroidvania" is a terrible phrase that gets in the way of its own definition and I hate it.


It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dracovish distribution mystery gift code is "GANJ0UAG0882"
A Dracovish distribution is currently underway for Pokemon Sword and Shield, as the game clings to life before Scarlet and Violet come and take all the special event fun away.
The code comes compliments of the Pokemon TV show promo in Japan, where the code was announced during a broadcast. It's the first code that highlights Ash's team, and more codes will come later for Dragonite (August 26), Gengar (September 2), Sirfetch'd (September 9), and Lucario (September 16). It's a neat little promo that also hits a little close to the anime, which is cool. The code is "GANJ0UAG0882," and you'll enter it via the mystery gift system.
With that in mind, I hope Nintendo and Game Freak step things up with Scarlet and Violet. These sorts of themed distribution events are really easy to do and should happen way more often. Ideally, none of them will require anyone to step foot in a GameStop! Currently, we're 1/1 on that, with the aforementioned Pikachu event serving as a basic incentive to just pick the game up before the end of February.
With a lot of the innovations from Pokemon Legends already in everyone's collective mindset, Scarlet and Violet have a lot to prove; especially when it comes to open-world exploration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below: 
Welcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD
August 11, 2022
As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-11T17:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.]]></summary>

This normally costs £18, so that's a nice little savings - and of course it's far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

It's capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it's dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a "comedy open-world RPG" where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You'll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, "Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022." Check it out for yourself below:

August 11, 2022
As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let's be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Kirby's Dream Buffet that showcases many of the minigames we'll be partaking in when the game hits Switch. 
And speaking of Switch, today's overview trailer reveals that Kirby's Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That's exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby's Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby's different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby's Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too). For more information about Kirby's Dream Buffet, be sure to check out this story. After that, read this Kirby series retrospective that dives deep into the character's origins and more.

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventu…]]></summary>

Now, it's not a stunner as far as looks go, and it's not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it's far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it's been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld's usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I'm excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.]]></summary>

The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet for ourselves. 
Here's the video: 


If you're looking for more information on the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1Up cabinet, read our news story about the announcement. Here's a snippet:
One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom's robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize.

I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken's offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a "Yup, that's me!" kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey's dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

        <updated>2022-08-10T12:13:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in June during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it's fun to listen to Fullerton's takes as both a game maker and a college professor.

As efforts to gather intelligence and seize domains continue, the studios have also been dealing with PrimeWire replacement 'HydraWire'.

        <updated>2022-08-09T18:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter's great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we'll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine's Day and the second arriving in April.

August 9, 2022
The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega's mascot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you'll soon find out, it's anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that's harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn't). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega's iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called "Bean Hill Zone" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a "Bean Hill Zone" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.
Those aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that.

August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

After seeing discounts on AMD's first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we're now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia's RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it's been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

        <updated>2022-08-08T15:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take "some time" before the system is finished. 
While that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.]]></summary>

We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie's highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. 
More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:
Tune in on August 10 at 6 a.m. PT for a livestreamed #Splatoon3 Direct presentation. Join us in the Splatlands for roughly 30 minutes of updates! pic.twitter.com/iFfaU3V6vM
August 8, 2022
As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

        <id>118915</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/08/snk-reveals-a-new-fatal-fury-game-the-first-in-more-than-20-years-is-now-in-development"/>
        <updated>2022-08-08T13:05:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn't even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.
Then in 2020, something changed. With many of my normal social activities put on hold, I found myself with more free time at home tha…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-05T18:41:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. 
Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. 
“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” 
All of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:


Santa Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.
The two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. 
The patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom's robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi. 
As it has done with most of its recent cabinets, Arcade1Up offers more than just the game on the marquee. You can see the full list of eight classic Marvel games included in this cabinet below.
Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Marvel vs. Capcom
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter
X-Men vs. Street Fighter
Marvel Super Heroes
X-Men: Children of the Atom
X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse
Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been largely unavailable since 2013, with home digital versions getting delisted or physical copies skyrocketing in price. Arcade1Up's Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet opens up for pre-orders starting September 8, with orders shipping a few weeks later in early October. The package includes a matching custom riser, light-up marquee, a headphone jack, and exclusive side-panel art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love Final Fantasy. I’ve played nearly every numbered entry and have beaten most of them. I adore Final Fantasy Tactics. I watched both terrible feature films. My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.
MMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. 
I’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!
Watch on Twitch!
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

It's a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don't think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It's a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity.
