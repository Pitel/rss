        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic have dropped a bunch of details as to planned improvements for the Epic Games Store in the on-going race to out-Steam Steam - the Coca-Cola to Epic's Pepsi Max. Amongst other things, we can expect more robust search features, support for third-party subscriptions, better EGS launcher performance, a download manager with improved controls, and a new "for you" personalisation tab - all of that rolling out across 2024 and 2025.


Naturally, Epic will be continuing with their free games program through "2023 and beyond", and they've also put together a couple of special publishing offers for developers, Epic First Run and Now on Epic, which are designed to lure more studios from the amoeba-like embrace of Valve's gaming empire.

Sonic's new 2D adventure, Sonic Superstars, is finally here. The game has released on multiple platforms today, so the choice of where to play is all yours — what a treat! Some of you may already be tucking into the blue blur's latest (and we can't say that we blame you), but if you have been waiting to see how the console versions stack up against each other, then gosh, do we have the video for you.
The good folks over on the YouTube channel GameXplain have put together a graphics comparison for the Switch and the PS5 so you can check out the visual discrepancies between the two. The video provides both a wipe and side-by-side comparison, so you can really get a feel for how the game runs (heh heh) on both consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developed by Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio, and released on September 18, Lies of a P is a soulslike that has managed to stand out in its oversaturated genre by offering a unique take on Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio. Developers have revealed that the game has already sold a million copies globally. 




This achievement comes with relatively good critical acclaim, and it currently has "Very Positive" user reviews on Steam. Commenting on the milestone in a press release, Neowiz CEO Seungchul Kim stated that "this incredible milestone for Lies of P proves the potential of Korean console games on the global stage."


Both South Korean studios should be very proud of their success, though it did not come easily, and Kim reveals that "the Lies of P project was a challenging endeavor for Neowiz and Round8 Studio." There were also a few minor controversies along the way, including the removal of an anti-cop sign in the game. 


Developers are just beginning to enjoy the fruits of their labor, as the game has also received some notable award show nominations. This includes a "Best Visual Design" nomination at this year's Golden Joystick Awards ceremony.

After 24 years of leadership, Hines is retiring and will begin an "exciting new chapter" of his life to explore other interests and passions. He says it wasn't a decision that "came easily or quickly" but after the "incredible launch" of the company's new IP and game Starfield, he felt the time was right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s almost time for Alan Wake 2, but if you haven’t played the original (or if you’d like to replay it before you jump into the sequel) you can get Alan Wake, as well as seven other spooky games, for $13. 


This deal is part of Humble Bundle’s “Fright of Your Life” bundle. The proceeds of this month's bundle go to support International Medical Corps and Direct Relief. If you pay at least $13, you can add STASIS: Bone Totem, Bendy and the Ink Machine, Bendy and the Dark Revival, Alan Wake Collector’s Edition, Hidden Deep, Tormented Souls, Pathologic 2, and Moons of Madness to your library on Steam.


Plus, it's the Alan Wake Collector’s Edition. This version includes not only the base game but also a pair of special episodes called “The Signal” and “The Writer." There's also developer commentary, an illustrated PDF book, and a soundtrack with nearly an hour of fully mastered audio tracks composed by Petri Alanko, Old Gods of Asgard, and Poets of the Fall. 


It’s just in time for the sequel, Alan Wake 2, on October 27 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via the Epic Games Store. The game's director, Sam Lake, also recently confirmed his plans for free DLC at this year's EGX. That is to say, catch up now before your Alan Wake to-do list grows too long. 


In addition to experiencing (for the first time, no less) the Pacific Northwest adventures of Alan Wake, being able to add both games in the Bendy and the Ink Machine duology to my library makes this bundle one I don’t want to pass up. I still haven’t been able to play Bendy and the Dark Revival, so this might be my best opportunity.

There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. 
Case in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.

This specific campaign takes place over four weeks and will reward viewers with various Oricalchum cosmetics. Each week a separate cosmetic is obtainable, with viewers having to watch four hours total of anyone in the Diablo 4 category on Twitch in order to obtain the drop.

Diablo 4 Season 2 Twitch Drop Schedule


Here is the complete schedule for the Diablo 4 Season 2 Twitch Drop campaign over the next four weeks:


Week 1: Twitch Drops for Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer



Start Time: October 17, 10 a.m. PDT


End Time: October 24, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Cosmetic: Oricalchum Blade Item Cosmetic



Week 2: Twitch Drops for Barbarian and Druid



Start Time: October 24, 12 p.m. PDT


End Time: October 31, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Reward: Oricalchum Mallet Item Cosmetic



Week 3: Twitch Drops for Barbarian and Necromancer



Start Time: October 31, 12 p.m. PDT


End Time: November 6, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Reward: Oricalchum Greatsword Item Cosmetic



Week 4: Twitch Drops for Druid



Start Time: November 6, 12 p.m. PST


End Time: November 13, 12 p.m. PST


Reward: Oricalchum Quarterstaff Item Cosmetic



Overall the Orichalcum cosmetics look pretty clean. They aren't flashy or anything, but I kind of prefer that way. Instead, they looked sturdy and intricately laden with Orichalcum, I guess to help slay vampires, which is the theme of the season.


Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, begins on October 17 on all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The third and more than likely final season of the World of Warcraft: Dragonflight expansion is almost here. Guardians of the Dream will release on November 7 and bring with it an all-new zone—The Emerald Dream—a new faction, updates to Dragonriding, new character customizations, and a new public event. And just one week later the new raid, Amirdrassil, will open up for players to challenge. Inside the raid players will find new class tier sets as well as a new legendary weapon called Fyr'alath the Dream Render. Finally, alongside the raid, a brand new Mythic + Seasonal rotation will begin as well as a new PvP season with a new PvP Brawl Mode called Battleground Blitz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escape From Tarkov is one of the most complex first-person shooters on the market right now, and it has successfully been holding onto this title for years now. This complexity appeals to many players: from its excessively detailed weapon modification systems to its janky but engaging combat loop, Tarkov delivers the sort of experience that virtually no other FPS has delivered. They've certainly tried, mind. The game's appealing complexity, however, goes hand-in-hand with its always-online progression systems, where you're always engaging with other players. This, of course, means you're always at the risk of losing everything you're carrying, which is bound to put many people off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a fan of the Naruto anime, chances are there are a handful of songs that live rent-free in your head. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden have been home to some of the most iconic opening themes, and they're on the way to the next game. Bandai Namco announced new DLC for Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections adding five fan-favorite songs along with some in-game items. 


Here's a sample, so go ahead and start belting out your best anime theme song karaoke. 




The new in-game items include the Ninja Info Card Skin and two substitution items: Microphone and Orange Headphones. The five featured themes include:



“GO!!!” by FLOW


“Haruka Kanata” by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION


“Blue Bird” by Ikimonogakari


“Silhouette” by KANA-BOON


“Kaze” by Yamazaru



Reliving Naruto history


All of the songs are essentials from the Naruto series, with FLOW's "GO!!!" providing the fourth opening theme song for the original. ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's "Haruka Kanata" was the second for Naruto, and Ikimonogakari's "Blue Bird" was the third for Naruto Shippuden. KANA-BOON's "Silhouette" served as Naruto Shippuden's 16th OP, and Yamazaru's "Kaze" directly followed that act. The series has a ton of themes, and this lineup runs the gamut with some heavy hitters.


The appropriately named The Nostalgic Anime Song & Item DLC will be available for all platforms. It's also coming to the limited time Sound Ultimate Bundle, which is a Steam exclusive set that includes the game, season pass, and more. You'll be able to play along with these themes when Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections hits consoles and PC on November 17.

After snooping through files, Corrêa explained how they pieced together that Motorsport's configuration still used low-definition textures even when set to Ultra. Corrêa also shows they fixed the rendition of wheels at extreme speeds, along with other issues discovered combing configuration files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. 
Taking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the debut trailer is anything to go by, chaos is on the menu for Starnaut. Developer Crim announced the spacey adventure for PC, with Early Access to kick off in February 2024. The roguelike action game has you playing as an astronaut on a solo space expedition that lands them in the multiverse. From there you'll be blasting "endless incoming enemies" that can be deceptively cute and drop what seems to be an equally endless number of coins. 


Check out a sample of the running, blasting, and frequently exploding gameplay in the debut trailer.




Blaster master


The straightforward story sets up a world in which people launched Omega Rockets containing their memories and history before doomsday struck. The rockets ended up landing in the multiverse, though, so it's up to Starnaut to find out if humanity can come back from the brink if all the rockets are returned. More importantly, doing so gives Starnaut an excuse to run around, fire off countless volleys, and collect coins for weapon and suit upgrades.


It all looks like utter madness. There are massive tentacles, floating panda bears, and a bunch of rockets ready to launch. Get all the Omega Rockets flying and launch along with the last one and you'll take home the win, it seems. "Those enemies are not only hungry for you but YOUR KNUCKLE SANDWICH!!!," the description reads. That's a powerful bullet point, right there. 


If the name Crim sounds familiar, that's because it's Sawaki Takeyasu's company. The director behind 2011's El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron previously bought that game's rights in 2013, and an HD remaster launched in 2021. Takeyasu is now enthusiastically tweeting about Starnaut, so we'll have to see how it shapes up as we get closer to Early Access.

Before we can critique, we must first establish what is and what isn’t kusoge. That is to say, a crap game. Even though I am the foremost and sole member at the institute, it can be quite a challenge, as was the case with the Carmageddon series.


Carmageddon has a lot of the facets of kusoge. Each game invariably controls like garbage. Its vehicle physics is detestable. And the mechanics are very loosely tied together and wobbly. However, as I was doing the legwork to establish the series as kusoge, I realized that, while they are concept-first games, they are fun to play under their own merits.


However, there are (at least) two exceptions in the series. The first is Carmageddon 64, which is not only t…]]></summary>

The game signals the return to Mario’s roots from a core gameplay perspective, but it’s more connected to Mario’s past than most people initially realized. While many remember the creative level design, expressive art style, and discovery of the game-changing Wonder Flowers, the most memorable moment came at the end of the announcement trailer, as everyone’s favorite plumber grabbed a never-before-seen item and transformed into an elephant. That moment told everyone that Super Mario Bros. Wonder, despite taking the series back to its 2D origins, is trying bold, new things unlike anything the franchise has seen before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher tinyBuild and developer Scythe Dev Team, the developers behind popular creepy restaurant simulator Happy's Humble Burger Farm have revealed their new title, Return to Northbury Grove. Those interested in some spooky goodness don't have to wait long because the new title is out...well...now. Players can download the free Action Adventure title for free on Steam.




VR Only


It appears VR is required to experience Return to Northbury Grove, as the notice on the Steam page indicates a VR headset is required. For now, it looks like OpenXR, Oculus XR, SteamVr, and WMR are the supported platforms.


In Return to Northburgy Grove, players take on the role of Liam Murphy, an aspiring actor determined to land the role of a lifetime at the infamous Rock the Warehouse music festival. When he gets there though, the concert grounds are desolate and Liam gets kidnapped and thrown into the basement of the Spector Forest Slasher's kill-house.


In classic Scythe Dev Team fashion, the visuals and audio are chilling, to say the least. According to the Steam Page, choices matter and can impact your survival in real time. Adaptive AI makes no two playthroughs the same.


I'm not quite on the VR train just yet, but this is certainly the kind of game meant for VR. It's like a slasher horror movie except in VR. After playing HHBF I know that Scythe knows how to nail a creepy atmosphere, so I'm sure it's a journey.


Return to Northbury Grove is available now for free on Steam.

As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.
While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart serie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.


Moral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.

Speaking of surprises, the biggest Switch-only game this week is Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, which has managed to hop its way back into fifth place on the charts after benefitting from a hefty Amazon discount for Prime Day — nice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.5 launched with the final tier of its Myths of the Realm Alliance Raid earlier this month, and it's still packing secrets to discover. The new 24-man raid apparently has a little easter egg for players familiar with the MMO's fishing lore, and it involves shooting your shot with one of the realm's 12 gods, Llymlaen.


In the Thaleia Raid, if you catch her at just the right time, using the '/blowkiss' emote on Llymlaen causes her to stop and scold you. "Oi, cut it out, you!" she chides, before hitting you with True Damage and taking you down to one HP. 




The Japanese FFXIV fan site Umadori first chronicled player encounters with Llymlaen last week. The attack she uses is Navigator's Dagger, a fish found in La Noscea, where, you guessed it, Llymlaen is the patron god. The in-game description notes these long, blade-like fish are the "knives thrown by Llymlaen at Her enemies." The bigger version of that fish, Navigator's Brand, adds, "Fishers believe that this wavekin was the blade that Llymlaen threw at Oschon in Her fury at having Her naked form espied."


Anyway, in the name of science, I tested the FFXIV easter egg myself. I'm happy to report Llymlaen kicked my ass. Sorry for the uh, messy screenshot. I was a little too antsy about getting the watcher of the seas to stab me to death, so quality wasn't top of mind.


Screenshot by Destructoid


I couldn't tell you the exact moment I caught her, but I did spam the 'blowkiss' emote with the chatlog option turned off — didn't want to spam the chat. But at some point, I did get her to turn to me, stun my poor Warrior of Light, and take her down to one HP. I was stunned for so long I died, but worth it. I got the kiss and the clear, and now I'm off to try this on Halone.

The memos and emails in question are from now-defunct US gun company Remington Arms, which was once part of the conglomerate Freedom Group. They've been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.

Made by the same team behind 2018's Project Hospital, Silence Of The Siren is an homage to Heroes Of Might And Magic where several different alien races are fighting to control a distant alien planet.

Now, with players spending more and more time in the game, they're figuring out that there are ways to deliberately trigger the appearance of certain points of interest, potentially underlining this problem.


Notably, Starfield player and Reddit user sterrre appears to have figured out a way to deliberately spawn Spaceship Debris landing zones on planets: one that is both obvious and interesting, if you think about it, but somehow managed to fly under the radar up until now. Ac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 24 years at Bethesda, industry veteran Pete Hines has announced his retirement. He explains that he came to this decision after a long and successful career that culminated with the launch of Starfield, and he feels that it is the right time to bow out. 


In his announcement post, he thanked fans for all their support over the years. It's not quite clear yet whether he is fully exiting the industry, as he says that he will now spend his time "exploring interests and passions," in addition to stating that "this is certainly not goodbye by any means." 




In response, Bethesda sent Hines a heartwarming Tweet prescribing him plenty of goodies, including lots of gaming, card collecting, and devoting his love and care to foster puppies. It has not yet been revealed who will take his place as Head of Publishing for Bethesda Softworks. 


Bethesda will march forward without Hines, with Todd Howard still serving as the studio's executive producer. The studio has a lot on its plate for the future. Starfield DLC is on the way, and Todd has also revealed that The Elder Scrolls 6 is in the works and there are plans for Fallout 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Analogue has announced the next in their line-up of FPGA-powered console recreations. This time, they’ll be revisiting a personal favorite of mine, the Nintendo 64, with the Analogue 3D.


Analogue is playing it pretty coy with the Analogue 3D. The only thing I have in terms of news is some shadowy images of the hardware and controller and the promise that it will be 100% compatible through the use of FPGA hardware emulation.


This is sort of big news because the N64 has been notoriously hard to emulate accurately. Even Nintendo’s own attempts at software emulation through the Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online haven’t been perfect. Through the use of FPGA they can emulate the hardware, rather than the software environment, ensuring maximum compatibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Analogue Pocket is a retro handheld marvel, capable of playing your favorite Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its beautiful screen with modern sensibilities and technology – simply put, it's the best way to play a Game Boy game, assuming you can get your hands on the always-sold-out device. Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. 
Analogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:
An image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: 
Analogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have "4 original-style controller ports," presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed "us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes," and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. 
Analogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). 

While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Skyrim modding community continues to be a haven of creativity for those that like messing with Bethesda's formula. Want to carry corpses around like you're Garret from Thief? Now you can. Want NPCs to break wind? Thy will be done. What about healing your followers mid-battle? That's also a possibility.


Thanks to veteran modder JaySerpa over on Nexus Mods, there's a way to assist downed companions with a press of a button. Providing you have some potions, you can heal friendly NPCs, rather than waiting for them to recover automatically.




They even come with some lines of dialog for when you help them, as demonstrated in the video above. JaySerpa says the idea for their "Press E to Heal Followers" mod came straight from Starfield, which has a similar feature.


It just won't die


Say what you will about Skyrim, it's the gift that keeps on giving. At least as far as custom content is concerned. Given that we're approaching 12 years since the game first released, it's actually quite impressive that it's stood the test of time.


Okay, it's definitely aged at this point, but that's where modders like JaySerpa come to the rescue. Over the years, we've seen everything from graphical overhauls to bug fixes to new ways of being immersed incorporated into TES5 by the fan base.


We'll never know whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will be able to enjoy such longevity. We still don't know when it's coming out, but so long as the Skyrim community keeps releasing mods, Bethesda's 2011 epic won't be going anywhere for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morteshka, the developer behind The Mooseman and The Black Book, has shown off their latest horror concoction, One-Eyed Likho, in a new trailer.


Do not adjust your monitor. The 4:3 aspect ratio is a feature of this first-person walking sim horror. One-Eyed Likho is based on the Slavic folklore creature of the same name. The developer describes it as “Likho is an embodiment of evil fate and misfortune in Slavic mythology.”




Not only is One-Eyed Likho in 4:3, but it’s also in greyscale. The latter isn’t entirely uncommon, but the former is pretty rare these days when it comes to 3D titles. But beyond those visual quirks, the game looks rather interesting. There’s some good horror imagery and good use of the game’s darkness. There’s a lot of arson depicted, which is always a plus in my book. Morteshka describes it as “burn mechanics,” which I can get behind. The protagonist also burns their fingers if they hold a lit match for too long, which is something I’ve always wanted to see.


I don’t often intentionally seek out walking simulator games, but I usually enjoy the ones that I play. As a cinematic splinter of the adventure genre, they’re an effective way of telling a narrative. Also, they seem to recognize that you can’t just solve every problem with a gun or even a length of metal pipe, which is something we should all learn.


One-Eyed Likho is currently set to release sometime in 2024. There will be a demo for it from October 26 to November 2, 2023.

The interview isn't all sour, however, as he also discusses the lessons the studio learned and the changes that occurred. 


When asked whether the studio knew things weren't looking good before the game's launch, Walder argues that during game development, "no one can predict everything that's going to happen until it actually happens." Hence, it's only with hindsight that you can determine what went wrong.

There are vacuum tubes mounted on one wall, doors to either side, and a ladder leading further down into darkness.
You click one of the doors and the perspective switches over slide-projector style to a second room with identical proportions. There are pipes emerging from the floor, here, and some kind of antique radio on a pedastel in the centre. Hang on, I know this place. I know this formless sense of dread. I know these machinations. The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate. This is Submachine, a 14-part escape puzzle series from Mateusz Skutnik, which Skutnik has now compiled, polished-up and re-released as Submachine: Legacy.

From their mascot platformer days, you could consider me a fan, and when they started to shift into more serious narratives with Resistance, I was along for the ride. But it wasn't until Marvel's Spider-Man in 2018 that I perked up and realized what they could do. With the standalone Miles Morales game and now the full Spider-Man sequel, they're really proving that they're one of the biggest forces in game development right now.


Yep! Even though there are a few lingering series issues present here, they didn't screw up the follow-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fact that Minecraft recently surpassed 300 million sales shows that Mojang's sandbox IP is still a force to be reckoned with. Much of its appeal comes from the ability to create nearly anything you want. In some cases, different worlds from different franchises get the blocky treatment.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, environmental artist and self-professed Bloodborne fan Potomy has released a new project for Minecraft inspired by FromSoftware's gothic game. A few screenshots show the level of detail that's gone into the recreation. However, if you want a better idea of how it looks, the below video gives you a nice taster.




The only downside to it is, if you want to download the map, you'll need to subscribe to Potomy's Patreon page. It'll set you back $41/£36, so you need to be a pretty big fan of both games if you want to justify paying for it.


Imagine fighting a blocky Cleric Beast


Released in 2015, Bloodborne was exclusively a PS4 title. There hasn't really been any attempt to port the game to other systems, but datamining suggests a PC build is somewhere in the ether. It's a bit of a shame you can't get the game on anything other than the previous-gen PlayStation, especially considering its popularity.


As for Minecraft, it continues to be one of the biggest rag-to-riches stories in video game history. From its small beginnings made by a single person to one of the most successful IPs in gaming, it's still going strong after all these years.


In fact, come 2024, Minecraft will officially be 15 years old (unless you count the alpha release from 2009). In terms of longevity, even the likes of Skyrim can only dream of such a legacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Alan Wake 2 can certainly fall under the horror category, it's hard to know whether the game will be scary or not. However, what we can say for certain is that there will be some additional content coming post-release, some of which will be free.


Director Sam Lake confirmed at EGX (in a Twitter post retweeted by Lake himself) that Alan Wake 2 will be getting some "free DLC drops" which are said to be "pretty significant." At this stage, there's no information about what this new content will be.




However, in the short clip attached to the tweet, Lake goes on to say that the team will be able to go "more into detail pretty soon after the game is out," and that all this DLC "will be free for everyone" who has the game.


A turn-up for the books


It also looks as though Alan Wake 2 will also get some paid DLC. Again, not much is known about this yet. The sequel itself has yet to come out, but it's nice to know that there's more on the horizon.


It's been 13 years since the original installment came out on Xbox 360. While it may not have been much of a horror game-changer, it certainly left an impression on fans of the genre.


Now, with the second entry releasing on October 27, the long wait is finally nearly over. Also, if you're looking to get a new graphics card soon, you might be interested to learn that Alan Wake 2 is free with purchases of select Nvidia GPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wild Gentlemen has announced that they're releasing Zipp’s Café, a prologue game to their upcoming Chicken Police: Into the Hive. it's said to "cost as much as a small coffee" when it releases on November 15. I don't drink coffee, so I don't know how much that is.


Zipp’s Café casts you as the eponymous Zipp, proprietor of the Hop Dog. Zipp made an appearance in Chicken Police: Paint it Red as someone who reluctantly helps protagonists Marty and Sonny, even after some previous unpleasantries. The game has you running the Hop Dog and serving a variety of regulars while getting the scoop on Clawville. It's plain that this is largely a worldbuilding game, but it includes three "full" mini-games, which are dishwashing, coffee making, and cooking. The Hop Dog has the best coffee in all of Clawville, but no one knows why.




There's a lot of unexplored lore in the noir-styled Chicken Police series. The world is equal parts gritty and vibrant, but it's obvious that The Wild Gentlemen have poured a lot of love into sketching out the details. I imagine that Zipp’s Café is a fun dive for them, as it helps establish more backstory in preparation for Chicken Police: Into the Hive.


Oh, and to top it off, the press release teases that it will tie into "other unannounced projects too." Pulp novels!? Are the unannounced projects going to be pulp novels!? Considering how much I loved Chicken Police: Paint it Red, I am very eager to dive into more of the universe.


Zipp’s Café is coming to PC on November 15, 2023 for the price of "a small coffee."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft update 1.21 has been revealed, and well, looks like Mojang have been reading my posts demanding the addition of a proper maze generator, those sneaky devils. As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.
The headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.

After being announced for Switch earlier this year, publisher and developer Illfonic has now revealed the Switch eShop page for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed - Ecto Edition which confirms that the creepy co-op ghost-hunter will be heading our way later this week on 19th October.
The game originally launched on PlayStation, Xbox and PC last year, and will see you playing as either Ghostbuster or, well, Ghost, in a series of 'hide and seek'-style games. It's a 4-vs-1 set-up where a group of Proton Pack-wielding protagonists team up to catch an illusive ghoul — think of the Luigi's Mansion minigame in Nintendo Land and you won't be a million miles away.

Endless Dungeon is a very splashy, confidently clever roguelike about spannering turrets, hosing bullets, and popping bugs like angry little pimples.

A tasty one-more-go-er, perfectly suited to serving up in these dreary autumn months. There.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Burning rubber.
Hot Wheels, man. We remember those. In the '90s almost every Saturday morning ad break featured a Hot Wheels commercial braying out superlative adjectives over thrashy rock solos. Invariably, two pearly-toothed, spiky-haired kids would grin as their miniature cars jostled for pole position, giving each other a thumbs-up after a totally tubular crash. All we ever wanted was a simple orange loop — because the loop was the coolest gravity-defying thing ever — but we never got one because the Super Nintendo was a life priority. We did manage to try one once, though, and pinged that car down the straight at full speed, ripping up the lip, only for it to soar off and go clattering across the ground. While you can still spectacularly succumb to gravity in Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged, if you blast the accelerator for all its worth you’ll coast that loop through an elating 360 degrees.
Here, the world of collectible racing cars has been virtually recreated in a splendidly inventive fashion. What’s striking about Unleashed 2 is the creativity that’s been put into its various modes, featuring clever ideas that don't just lean on existing tropes, but dig into the fascinating meta of miniature racing within giant, real-world environments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to video game sales, there are very few titles that operate on the same stratosphere as Minecraft. The timeless sandbox game has shown its dominance yet again with an announcement from Mojang revealing that it has sold 300 million copies, helping it retain its position as one of the bestselling games of all time. 




The announcement came during the Minecraft Live event held on October 15. Helen Chiang, who is the head of Mojang Studios, stated that the milestone was something "no one could have dreamed of when we were all placing our first blocks." She also showed appreciation for the community, stating that it "has built Minecraft into what it is today and what it will become in the future." 


Mojang shared some interesting stats on Minecraft's official site. Between September 2023 and October 2023 alone, on average per day, there have been 15 million skeletons slayed, 8.8 million pickaxes crafted, and 6.7 million diamonds discovered.

Minecraft's success story


It's been a long road for Minecraft to reach the heights it has. The game was birthed in 2009 by Notch and it gained a large following of avid fans that allowed the game to grow so popular that it was purchased, along with Mojang, by Microsoft for an amazing $2.5 billion in 2014. 


Since then, Minecraft has only grown thanks to a steady stream of new content, including the recent Trails and Tales update. There have also been numerous spin-offs released such as Minecraft Legends which launched in April this year. 


Fans have plenty to look forward to. As the Minecraft Live event revealed, the armadillo is the winner of the 2023 Mob Vote. Minecraft is also turning 15 in 2024, and there is plenty in store to celebrate.

Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit I've been a bit sceptical of Loco Motive since it was first announced a little while ago. Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the imminent release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Sony has released the launch trailer, and it highlights the rise of a darker Peter. 


The trailer showcases a number of huge sequences that are coming in the game, but be warned that it could also be considered pretty significant story spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. 




Peter & Miles team up against classic foes in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 launch trailer


In the trailer, Miles goes to Peter to ask for help. The trailer implies that Miles is in over his head fighting the Sandman. Fans of the original game may remember Sandman was teased via a backpack collectible that contained a vial of sand that Peter wasn’t sure if it actually contained Sandman or just some inert sand.


But the highlight of the trailer is the showcase of Venom and the symbiote-infected Peter, including a Peter in darker clothes and a rude demeanor towards MJ that hearkens back to Spider-Man 3. 


The trailer also reveals Norman calling for Oscorp enforcers to “get the symbiote off of him!,” though the camera does not reveal who the him is. While it has been confirmed it won’t be Eddie Brock, and the first game teased it would be Harry Osborn, the actual identity of the game’s Venom has been kept a closely guarded secret. 


The trailer does showcase more of the black suit, including a knock-down fight between Spider-Man and Lizard. There's also a tense battle between Miles and Mr. Negative, which would mark the first time Miles has been one-on-one with the man responsible for his father’s death. 


Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 releases October 20 for the PlayStation 5. You’ve still got plenty of time to pre-order that digital deluxe edition and get all those sweet costumes.

An immaculate and widely acclaimed aircraft simulator with the sort of pedigree that almost no other modern gaming franchise could compare with, and one that's due for a comprehensive 2024 update to make it even better. But that's not even close to the full story, as Parallel 42's wacky Juice Goose third-party DLC can attest to. Indeed, it would appear that some enterprising devs have been working in the background to redefine what Microsoft Flight Sim can and cannot do.


Setting aside the wildly entertaining idea that Microsoft Flight Simulator might unofficially be turning into something along the lines of Forza Horizon, with the whole world being its playable area, the Juice Goose is supposedly a rather high-quality offering. Which…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I see dirt, I know what I must do: clean. Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vincent is coming out of his coffin. Announced at the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth voice cast panel at New York Comic-Con, the voice actor for the gun-toting ex-Turk has been officially confirmed: Matt Mercer. This comes after fans claimed the prolific voice actor was the character when he appeared in the latest State of Play.




Disturbing Vincent Valentine's slumber


As host, Matt Mercer brings up his background work in FFVII Remake after introducing the cast. He then puts the rumors to bed (or coffin, in this case) by saying that he will take on the role of Vincent Valentine in the sequel. Vincent, in Final Fantasy VII, is a former Turk who joins Cloud and his crew on their escapades as revenge on Hojo. He also was the protagonist in Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus, voiced by VA legend Steve Blum.


Being in the industry for many years, Matt Mercer is no stranger to big-ticket roles. His parts in Persona 5 (Yusuke), Fire Emblem (Chrom), and Overwatch (Cole Cassidy) were heavily praised. He also hosts the popular Dungeons & Dragons show, Critical Role. Most recently, he played the main villain Ganondorf in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Without a doubt, Matt is the perfect actor to take over Vincent Valentine. I, for one, can't wait to see him in all his glory.


While fans are likely to be excited by the announcement of Vincent, a fan-favorite character, it is worth noting Square Enix already confirmed he will not be a playable party member during an exclusive interview with Game Informer. 


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth releases on February 29, 2024, for PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first Mortal Kombat 1 DLC characters have finally been showcased in a brand-new trailer. 


While series creator Ed Boon had coyly stated they wouldn't be showing an Omni-Man gameplay trailer at New York Comic-Con, that didn't stop them from dropping the trailer online. 




The trailer reveals Omni-Man, voiced by J.K. Simmons, confronting Liu Kang. Liu threatens Omni-Man to kick things off, promising that while Omni-Man has destroyed worlds, he has erased whole timelines. 


That doesn't seem to phase Omni-Man, though, who gladly spends the trailer beating the absolute snot out of Liu Kang and Scorpion. 


Omni-Man's release coincides with the return of Invincible to Amazon Prime Video, as well as the 20th anniversary of the Invincible comic. In the original story, Omni-Man is presented as a Superman pastiche whose son develops superpowers, taking the name Invincible. However, Omni-Man reveals he is actually on Earth to conquer it and hopes to do so with his son at his side.

There are, in fact, multiple nods to the comic included, especially his two fatalities, which reference him holding Invincible up to an oncoming train and Omni-Man's crushing of Red Rush's skull when he murdered Invincible's version of the Justice League. 


In addition to Omni-Man, the trailer reveals the first DLC Kameo, Tremor. Originally debuting in the spin-off title Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, Tremor is now best known for his incredible redesign in Mortal Kombat X. 


Omni-Man is slated for a November 2023 release. Future Mortal Kombat 1 DLC for the game includes The Boys' Homelander, Peacemaker, Quan-Chi, Ermac, and Takeda. Mortal Kombat 1 is available right now. We gave it an 8/10, so it's pretty safe to say you should check it out.

Curiously, even though the game does have its fair share of gameplay-related problems, the problems that have been pushed into the spotlight are far more technical in nature. Namely, Lords of the Fallen runs exceedingly poorly. For some people, that is. Though some have managed to resolve the Unreal Engine 5 title's shoddy performance via driver updates, this is seemingly not a universal solution, meaning that the developer Hexworks has a long road ahead of it. The really curious bit, though, is that Lords of the Fallen seems to run just fine on the Steam Deck, of all things.


Indeed, as the aptly named YouTuber Deck Wizard has shown, Valve's low-spec gaming PC seems to be more than capable of running Lord…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a long history with the Borderlands franchise, with a few hundred hours in Borderlands 3 on PC. Now it’s available on the Nintendo Switch as well. So how does one of my favorite looter-shooters hold up on the little handheld console?


Fairly well, actually, especially given its size. The main game takes up 8.4 GB. The DLC is an additional 10.4 GB, or 15 GB if you include the additional voiceover language pack. Compared to the 138.9 GB of the Steam version, Borderlands 3 on the Switch is tiny!


The game itself runs quite well on the Switch. Framerates felt pretty stable in the 30-45 FPS range, rarely dropping to a noticeable degree. The controls feel fine, and there are plenty of button customization options if something isn’t working for you. The gameplay is still good ol’ Borderl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Do you hear screaming, or am I having another one of my episodes?".
A little less than ten years ago, a port of Borderlands 2 famously launched for Sony’s ailing PS Vita to middling reception. The fact that a then-current game could run at all on a portable was remarkable, but the flat visuals, crashing, and consistently sub 30 FPS performance relegated it to more of a novelty than a version that people would be comfortable playing for hours on end. When Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition was announced for the Switch, there was a lot of discourse that history would be repeating itself here, and this wasn’t helped by the general lack of footage leading up to release. Fortunately, any such fears can now be put to rest. Borderlands 3 runs shockingly well on the Switch, bringing over the full, crazy experience in all its glory for portable play.
Borderlands 3 picks up about seven years after the events of Borderlands 2 and follows the interstellar adventures of familiar Crimson Raiders like Lilith, Claptrap, and Ellie alongside newcomers like Ava and Lorelei. The gang this time around faces off against the Calypso Twins, a godlike sibling duo who have united the bandit clans of Pandora under a cult called the Children of the Vault. Notably, Tyreen Calypso has the ability to leech power from other creatures, and if she’s allowed to absorb the powers of the ancient beasts residing in the Vaults hidden across each planet, she’ll become virtually unstoppable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, this is just Trubbish. The Van Gogh Museum, which recently held a Pokemon collab that got a bit hectic, announced it will no longer distribute its Pikachu promo card at the physical exhibit starting October 14. If you want the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat collaboration card, you'll have to shop online for a qualifying purchase. 


As spotted by PokeJungle, the Van Gogh Museum explained it's no longer offering the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat promo card in person thanks to "a small group of individuals" it says "created an undesirable situation." Without the chaos around the card giveaway, the museum believes fans can visit the Pokemon exhibit in a safe, enjoyable experience.


Screenshot by Destructoid via Pokemon Center Store


However, the Pokemon Center will have the Pikachu card available later for online shoppers in the USA, Canada, and the UK, but no date was given. It will also go to various retailers in the Netherlands sometime next year. 


The Museum also notes it's still selling merchandise at the exhibit; it's just the Van Gogh Pikachu dropping from its offerings. Those items are up in its online store, too. Restocks happen weekly, so don't panic if the Van Gogh Museum's online store hits you with an "out of stock" notice. 


Can't Catch a Break


When the Pokemon exhibit was announced late September, many were in love with the concept. I mean, who doesn't want to see a Post-Impressionist painting of Snorlax? As always, there were people who saw it as a means to make a quick buck. So, when the event happened, droves of people flooded the Amsterdam museum to get their hands on merch, causing quite a stir. This led to the Van Gogh Museum pausing sales and an apology from the Pokemon Company.


The exhibit is still around, so if you do want to go as a real fan, tickets are still available. The Pokemon x Van Gogh event runs until January 7.

I figured it would be a niche title that was forgotten because it wasn’t especially noteworthy. That is not the case. Gley Lancer is beyond rad.


What’s Gley? I’m assuming it’s an off-white color, similar to cleam or beice. If you guessed mistranslation, then that seems to be the case here. The Japanese language doesn’t have any distinction between “r” and “l” consonant sounds, so someone was so absolutely certain that they had translated it correctly that they put it on the title screen. Let's cut them some slack. The internet wasn't what it is now. It definitely gives it that ‘90s charm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed in August that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario. Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani," Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!
October 13, 2023
Afghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder hits Switch exclusively on October 20. Ahead of its release, Mario graced the cover of the latest issue of Game Informer, and we've been diving deep into the making of the game and more in our exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder coverage hub. Here are some of the stories you can find in it:

Both offer co-op and competitive multiplayer options. Both deliver modernized visuals. And both give players new gameplay concepts and abilities that expand the original franchise vision in unprecedented ways. However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario's claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series' fates are forever intertwined. Sonic Superstars arrives on all consoles (including Switch) on October 17, just days before Super Mario Bros. Wonder lands exclusively on Switch on October 2…]]></summary>

There are 1,320 reviews at the time of writing, and they are Mostly Negative, which is quite the showing for a game's first day on sale.

You drive a selection of vehicles across an increasingly ludicrous desert while everything in the universe tries to stop you. But you have guns. Or flamethrowers.

After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

As the bare buttocks of returning Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga indicated in the reveal trailer for Infinite Wealth, we’re not in Yokohama anymore, but Honolulu, Hawaii. He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. 
Alas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.

Earlier today, Microsoft officially acquired Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick revealed he will remain as CEO through the end of the year after Xbox head Phil Spencer asked him to stay to help with the company transition. While staying through the end of the year presumes Kotick will depart from the company in 2024, that remained technically unknown.
However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says that Kotick will depart from Activision Blizzard, a company he took over 33 years ago, on January 1, 2024.

One of Superstars’ biggest selling points is to take down Eggman with up to three other players. Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …]]></summary>

Earlier this morning, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority approved Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The CMA was the last hurdle for Microsoft's acquisition after it received approval in more than 40 countries and regions, including the U.S. earlier this summer. The deadline for Microsoft to close this deal was October 18, but reports indicated the company was planning to finalize it today, October 13. That has now happened, and Activision Blizzard is officially part of Xbox's first-party studio umbrella.

The waves are nibbling playfully at the shoreline, the farmyard animals are shuffling about happily in their pens, your little sister is bouncing around being a perfect nuisance like always. Time to get busy, then. The cows need to be milked, the eggs need to be gathered from the chicken coop, the seeds need to be sowed and watered. 


You might find an hour to do a bit of scavenging, here and there - gathering mussels from the rocks at low tide, or putting aside some wood for that pier your dad asked you to build. Just, don't forget the gods. The gods have needs too. Today it's crabs. Tomorrow? Who knows.

But it's not alone; the Legend of Zelda series, which started around that time, also remains a genre leader all these decades later. During our discussions with Nintendo during our Super Mario Bros. Wonder cover story (and other interviews earlier this year), we tried to drill into why these franchises – in particular, the Mario franchise – have maintained their popularity and level of quality while so many other series have struggled to hold onto it for even a fraction of the time.

It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. "Lets you play your own Star Trek story" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.

The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a "surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape" in blissful Malibu.
There are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands. Here's a video of the opening.

After, Alex talks about why action puzzler Cocoon nails player feedback, and then we dive into the anals of our 2023 gaming backlog, highlighting releases we want to revisit or play for the first time before Game Informer's Game of the Year discussions in December.
Finally, our Listener Questions segment returns, discussing treating carpal tunnel and answering specific questions like, "What happened to the promised 120FPS console releases?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords Of The Fallen is a reboot of CI Games and Deck 13's 2014 action-RPG called… Lords Of The Fallen. We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.
Raise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.

Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. 
Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC last week and both critics and fans alike are quite happy with the series return to its roots. Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft's biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. 
Thank you all for joining us on Basim's journey in 9th Century Baghdad!

October 11, 2023
Alongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: 
479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad
60 million Leaps of Faith
1.2 million street cats pet
"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception," Ubisoft's statement reads. "We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


We had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review. If you're still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage tips and tricks. Read our interview with Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub after that.

He simply said, "This came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs" and that he feels "this outcome is for the best." Now, just a few weeks later, Kamiya has started a YouTube channel – aptly called "Hideki Kamiya Channel" – and in his first video, he reveals he's not retiring, as first reported by VideoGamesChronicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.
But up front it tells you "There are no wrong choices, only your choices" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about "tracing different pathways" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.

This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the "paragon of the future." The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a "deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces."


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive's scrapped version of Dead Island 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 
The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 


Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have "hundreds" of titles support this feature in the future. 
Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:
Japan – October 17
Europe – October 23
North America – October 30
As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming's mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you're a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

That seminal entry proved that Nintendo’s iconic plumber could transition to 3D and still be the juggernaut franchise it was in 2D. It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. 
In 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim. The visual improvements from the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube were apparent, and Super Mario Sunshine once again proved to be a hit with both fans and critics. While many celebrated the continued success of this 3D evolution for on…]]></summary>

Amongst other things, Kotick allegedly discussed machine learning, Guitar Hero and the apocalyptic power of Microsoft R&D. Activision hired James Corden to host the meeting, the sources claim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ara: History Untold's headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the "father of wargaming", in the mid-1800s. 


"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies," says Menard. "And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. 


"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?"

With reports indicating that the deal is set to close tomorrow, on October 13, the saga is almost over. Ahead of that deal's finalization, we learned Activision Blizzard will not be putting the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass this year. Now, thanks to a new report from WindowsCentral, we've learned Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick held an all-hands employee meeting yesterday where former late-night show host James Corden interviewed him about future technology, the acquisition, and Guitar Hero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of usefulness to the average PC owner, sales events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days aren’t just for knocking hundreds off big-ticket hardware. They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. 


This has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.

The trigger is this year's Minecraft Mob Vote, a community ballot to decide which of three creatures will be added to the game. Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang's current headcount and Microsoft's resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps? And now, those players are trying to shut the whole thing down.

The challenge ahead is to suppress pirate IPTV and streaming sites, the latter of which coincidentally hit the mainstream roughly 12 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alienware's AW3423DWF is a fantastic gaming monitor - and the one that I was the most sad to return after my review. This 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide debuted at $1100 last year, but it's now available for $300 off at Dell's US store in a nicely-timed Anti-Amazon deal. That brings it to $800 - still a lot of money for a monitor, but absolutely worth it for a monitor that has become well-loved for users and critics alike.

Created by Latvia-based Pahris Entertainment, it launches out of Early Access today with a brace of Very Positive reviews, tantalising perma-hungover Disco Elysium players like me with flirtatious mention of "an intentionally short", very non-linear campaign in which combat is totally optional and there are "three to eight ways" to complete any quest. "It's okay to fail," you say? Every NPC can be killed, even those apparently central to the story? Be still my beating heart.

Fantastic news, it's been binned off! In the course of making what they're calling "the largest technical leap in CS history", Valve have decided to discontinue support for MacOS. They're also doing away with support for older PCs, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems - in future, the game will be exclusive to 64-bit Windows and Linux systems.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/10/sony-announces-new-slim-playstation-5-models-with-removable-disc-drives"/>
        <updated>2023-10-10T16:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models," the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. "There are four separate cover panels," it says, "with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte." This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed its "fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: 
An update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6
October 9, 2023
As you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. 
In the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  


Total War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.

Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup. However, a new tweet by Activision Blizzard makes it sound like the company's games won't hit the subscription service until next year. Plus, Activision Blizzard says it won't be adding the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV to Game Pass this year.
Here's what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.
October 9, 2023
Diablo IV launched back in June and we had a great time with it. You can read about why in Game Informer's Diablo IV review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?


With the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a "mixed reality" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.

As expected, SSD prices have been widely cleaved; friend of RPS Will Judd already caught the superlative WD Black SN850X going for a bargain, and it turns out a bunch of excellent Crucial drives are on sale for even less.

The game in question is Saber Interactive's Wild Card Football, an arcade sporting sim in the spirit of the developer's previous NBA Playgrounds series, which is out today and attracting some buzz on Steam.

Since player progress gained unofficially upsets Cognosphere's business model, a crackdown isn't unexpected. The fact that the developer could be identified over five allegedly infringing screenshots comes as much more of a surprise.

The company expect to bring it home by 13th October.
Aside from hastening the arrival of a grim future that consists of a giant, mechanised Phil Spencer engaged in a trans-Pacific staring contest with Nintendo, this also means we can expect new and recent behemoths like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service.

Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself. Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Players won't need to wait long to play as Elephant Mario, as it appears in the very first stage, Welcome to the Flower Kingdom. The Elephant Fruit emerges out of a block, and true to the trailer, Mario transforms into this new for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy's comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game "built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance."
Puha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2's performance, but we'll get to that further down the page.)

You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.
Click the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, "underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a "rat god".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.”


Ohlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,” he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 10/10/23:
Yesterday, following news that developers at Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 studio CD Projekt Red have formed a union, Game Informer reached out to the company to ask if it had a comment or statement on it. Game Informer also asked if CDPR plans to voluntarily recognize the union. 
Here is the statement Game Informer received from a CDPR spokesperson:
The original story continues below...
Original story, 10/9/23:
Developers at Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 developer CD Projekt Red have formed a union. The union was formed in response to the company's three rounds of layoffs this year, as reported by Eurogamer. Polish Gamedev Workers Union founders Lev Ki and Paweł Myszka say that all necessary documentation has been submitted but that the union hasn't heard any response from…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to "overstaffing". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.


"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go," reads an official FAQ from the group. "This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis."

With Assassin's Creed Mirage on our minds, which is an overt throwback to the classic Assassin's Creed formula, we decided to take a look back at the first game in the blockbuster series. Some elements of the game hold up and others don't, but in any case, it's a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.
You can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin's Creed right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the last entry in the New Super Mario Bros. series, which was based on the idea of recreating the experience of the original Super Mario Bros. game from 1985 in a modern way, Nintendo went back to the drawing board. Though the four distinct New Super Mario Bros. games were well-received and extremely successful, the developers wanted to deliver something fresh to fans of the 2D series.
"The New Super Mario Bros. series has been going on for a while since the release of New Super Mario Bros. on Nintendo DS, so we wanted to create an all-new 2D Mario experience," Super Mario Bros. Wonder director Shiro Mouri says. "That's how this project started."
Despite the initial desire to create something new, Mouri and his development team started thinking about what made the series so disti…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arkane Studios' multiplayer vampire shooter Redfall launched earlier this year to middling reviews from critics and players alike – Game Informer gave the game a 5 out of 10. Ahead of its launch in May, Xbox revealed that Redfall would only launch with a 30 FPS Quality Mode on Xbox Series X/S, noting that a Performance Mode would arrive at a later unspecified date. Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall. 
Publisher Bethesda's patch notes about today's Redfall update don't specify how exactly this Performance Mode works, but presumably, it runs the game at 60 FPS. This update also brings some heavily requested features to Arkane as well, including stealth takedowns, more accessibility options, multiplayer communication improvements,…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-06T16:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include "1-3 hours of content" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project "in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team." That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is "set in the world" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.
For more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.]]></summary>

The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, "bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee."

It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, "Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. 
Red Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4
October 4, 2023
Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. 
If you've kept up with Mirage, you know it's a bit of a return to the series' roots. After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow.…]]></summary>

As one of the most popular and influential series in video games, Super Mario Bros. must appeal to a wide audience of players across a massive spectrum of skills. The main stages of nearly every Super Mario Bros. game accomplish this daunting feat through balanced level design, innovative gimmicks, and fun challenges that nearly anyone can complete. However, late-game and special stages have traditionally been the place where Nintendo tests the mettle and skill of more veteran players.
Areas like Special Zone in Super Mario World and stages like Champion's Road in Super Mario 3D World are just a couple of examples of Nintendo flex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
