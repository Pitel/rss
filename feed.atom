        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not often we get to have surprises in World of Warcraft. Datamining is so common that it's hard to avoid knowing everything about an event before it starts. That's handy for having guides ready, but there aren't many surprises left for players to discover. However, that's not the case for patch 10.2.6 — for now, no one aside from Blizzard has any details beyond the pirate flag teaser. 


This could mean anything. Maybe it's a storyline about major pirate factions going to war with each other. Perhaps the Bloodsails are going to try and take over Stormwind. It could just be "Talk Like a Pirate Day 2: Buccaneer Boogaloo." There really are no clues as to what's happening, and that's incredibly refreshing.


If we're looking for connections, there is a vague one. Dragonflight had no real pirate activity in any of the storylines, despite having a treasure-rich island. But there have been a lot of dragons, including the Infinite Dragonflight. The expansion prior, Shadowlands, featured a dungeon that had a surprise appearance by a time traveling pirate dragon.

In Tazavesh, the Veiled Market, we run into some extra-dimensional bandits who end up stealing something from pirates in Boralus Harbor. The leader of said pirates turns out to be Timecap'n Hooktail, a new character invented for the dungeon. It seemed like a waste of one of the best character designs ever made by human hands that Hooktail died in that fight. But, with time being all wibbly-wobbly, and dragons being the current focus of the expansion, perhaps Blizzard is bringing back Hooktail for another adventure.


Whatever it is, it's coming next Tuesday, March 19, arriving just in time to deliver some fresh new pirate threads to wear to the Trial of Style next Wednesday, March 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Port-o-remaster publishers Aspyr yesterday launched the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, bundling together the two 'What if Battlefield but Star Wars?' shooters originally released by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts in 2004 and 2005 (not to be confused with Dice and EA's uncolonic Star Wars Battlefront games from the mid-tensies). It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for consoles which never saw the games in the first place, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

Konami's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim from fans of the franchise (though we thought it was mostly "pretty good"), but that's not stopping the publisher from promoting the collection at every opportunity.
The latest video is a rather elaborate advertisement in which voice actor David Hayter, perhaps best known for his work on Metal Gear as Solid Snake and Big Boss, takes us on a brief journey through history as we dive into the classic Metal Gear Solid trilogy originally released on PS1 and PS2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of resources in Disney Dreamlight Valley and one of them, Glimmer, can be harder to find than others. Glimmer is used in recipes such as the Tavern Piano and Bing Bong’s Wagon, so it’s worth going after. 


Before you can head out in search of Glimmer, you need to upgrade your Hourglass to level 2. To do this, you’ll need to spend 10,000 Mist at the Timebending table. Upgrading your Hourglass will unlock more recipes and allow you to find more resources, including Glimmer. 


How to find Glimmer in Disney Dreamlight Valley

Glimmer cannot be found on the usual maps of Disney Dreamlight Valley. In order to find Glimmer, you’ll need to head to one of the following Realms:



Ratatouille


Moana


Wall-E


Frozen


Toy Story


The Lion King


Beauty and the Beast



At the time of writing, you cannot find Glimmer within the Monsters Inc. Realm. This is likely to be added in a future update, so we’ll keep you posted.


To make this easier, you can open up the map and use the Fast Travel menu to instantly travel to Realms. Once you’re there, use your Hourglass as you usually wood to open up rifts. Glimmer is one of the possible (and more likely) drops when inside Realms. 


What is Glimmer used for in Disney Dreamlight Valley?


Image by Destructoid


Glimmer is used as an ingredient in the following items, along with other resources found with the Royal Hourglass:



Agrabah Palace Model


Bing Bong’s Wagon


Highland Family Tapestry


Ice Harvester’s Pallet Bed


Monster-of-the-Month Frames


Mythic Vase


Scrooge’s First Dime


Tavern Piano


The V8 Cafe

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s one thing that has always caused issues in Palworld, it’s managing Pals on your base and trying to get them on a specific task. Well, according to PocketPair’s community manager, Bucky, that may soon be a thing of the past. 


In a post to the official Palworld Discord Server, Bucky revealed that as part of the next update, we’ll now be able to allocate Pals to certain jobs using a new feature planned for the Monitoring Stand. The preview image mostly speaks for itself. There's a list of up to 20 Pals and columns outlining the usual skills your critters may, or may not, be good at.

Bucky didn’t share too much information, much less when we can expect this update to arrive, but things look to be moving towards a large update some time soon, with Bucky saying that this was “a little sneak peak of another feature”, alluding to more that we have yet to see. 


I can personally attest to the infuriating system, or lack of one, that’s currently in place on the base. My Pals are known to do whatever they like, whenever they like and little that I do seems to change this. 


This updated system will likely put an end to having to physically pick up Pals and throw them at whichever piece of equipment we’d like them to work at, something that will be very welcomed by players. Of course, you’ll still have to manage Sanity levels by the usual means and the Monitoring Stand will still allow you to work Pals harder, or go easier on them, depending on your preference. 


Along with this new base management system, we also have the new Bellanoir raid to look forward to, and this is just what we know so far. Whenever this update arrives, it seems to be full of new content and improvements. We’ll let you know as soon as we hear more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft Montreal, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley and LEGO Star Wars: Castaways, has revealed that it's working on a new Dungeons and Dragons life-sim survival action RPG hybrid in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, who owns the D&D IP. 


The game is set to take place within the Forgotten Realms, the same D&D setting where the Baldur’s Gate series takes place, and also the backdrop for 2013’s Neverwinter along with a long list of other games. 


The Forgotten Realms were designed by game designer Ed Greenwood and are known to be filled with all manner of beasts and supernatural happenings, so there’s no telling what we’ll face once the as-yet unnamed game arrives.




There is no set release date or any more details currently available about the game but in their Instagram post, Gameloft states that: “Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time survival in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn. Stay tuned!”

Lee Kaburis, Executive Producer at Gameloft Montreal has said “we are all big fans of D&D and are already hard at work bringing our concept to life, including growing our team, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future.”


Eugene Evans, SVP of Digital Strategy and Licensing at Wizards of the Coast says about Gameloft: “Given their impressive record building incredible new experiences with major IPs combined with their passion for D&D and vision for this game, we are confident they will create an experience that will delight fans worldwide.”


According to the Instagram post, Gameloft is also actively recruiting for the project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It may not feel like it here in the UK, but we're on our way to spring, leaving the much colder days behind us. To kick-start the season, the Steam Spring Sale is already in session, and I've got my eye on a number of games that have been sat in my wishlist for ages.


This is probably the first major sale event of 2024 for the platform. While Steam has had a few already, this one feels like a much bigger deal, and there are plenty of things to choose from. There's no specific sales page, though. It's just a vast selection of titles that are going to be cheaper for a short while.




Just looking at the front page, I can see Palworld is currently 10% off, Ark: Survival Ascended is 20% off, and you can also get the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Hogwarts Legacy for half-price. The Spring Sale began yesterday, and will continue up to March 21. 


And then some


On a personal note, it's become pretty apparent that Steam wants me to buy some horror games, or all the horror games. I'm not entirely sure if this is based off what I've wishlisted in the past, or there's a market during this time of year for these types of games.


I can see Project Zomboid, Lethal Company, Escape the Backrooms, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Resident Evil 4, and Diablo 4 all on sale currently. I get it, guys. Sheesh.


There isn't much else to say about it. You all know how Steam sales work, whatever time of year they're live. So I'll just close by asking what everyone's doing this weekend. I'm probably doing some stuff in the garden. Hooray for being 40!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ‘90s were overwhelmingly glutted with one-on-one fighting games vying for arcade dominance, so it isn’t surprising that there might be a few that you hadn’t heard of. Take 1997’s Rabbit, for example, which just received a fan translation patch.


Rabbit was developed by Aorn, who is known for… Rabbit. It was published by Electronic Arts Victor, which was EA’s Japanese publishing arm, through a partnership with Victor Music Industries/Victor Entertainment.


As I mentioned, the fighting game scene exploded in the wake of Street Fighter 2, and while it was extremely competitive here in North America, it was even more pervasive in Japan at the time. The ‘90s saw the arcade in North America already in decline, but in Japan they were still holding strong, and that is partially due to the popularity of fighting games. This carried over to the home, where console hardware was starting to catch up to the arcade.


Every publisher wanted a piece of the pie that had already been chewed by more established brands, so it’s no surprise that EA wanted to try. Electronic Arts Victor was typically tasked with localizing EA’s existing titles, so Rabbit stands out as a unique endeavor. It was released on the Sega Saturn in 1997, and there was also a version for arcade. It wasn’t, however, localized for the West.

As for Rabbit itself, it’s a bright, colorful, and supposedly competent fighting game. There’s a selection of eight characters, each with their own spirit animal that can be summoned to fight alongside. Coincidentally, it was released very close to Bloody Roar, which also had animal powers, but the two games are miles apart.


Like most fighting games, Rabbit could easily be played without knowing Japanese, but you’d be missing out on all the cutscene dialogue.


The fan translation patch for Rabbit is available now thanks to Derek Pascarella, Bo Bayles, Walnut, and Malenko.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

For Black Armory fans, in particular, there may be good stuff here, as the latest announcement from Bungie is more revealing than we thought.


For quite a long while now, the Destiny 2 community has been asking Bungie to reissue the highly acclaimed Black Armory weapons, as the full repertoire got caught up in the game's big sunsetting of content. Now, at long last, we're finally getting the sense that things are happening on that front, as we now have not one but two separate sources suggesting Black Armory gear is going to be back on the menu in this or that form.

        <updated>2024-03-15T13:02:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of now, Saber Interactive has officially parted ways with parent company Embracer Group. The question that's going to be on a lot of people's lips is: why are you so handsome? No, I mean..."is the remake of Knights of the Old Republic still happening?" That's a much more sensible question.


The truth is, we still can't say for certain. However, Saber's Chief Creative Officer, Tim Willits (as noted by Eurogamer), recently posted on Twitter/X, confirming that the studio is still working on a number of projects. These include Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, and Jurassic Park: Survival.




There's no mention of the elusive KOTOR remake. Whether this is covered in the "working on a number of titles" bit of Willits' statement is not clear. The fact it's not mentioned at all could be a bad sign.


However, dot-dot-dot


With the COO of Saber Interactive neither confirming nor denying the game's existence, it's hard to walk away with a clear understanding of what's happening with Knights of the Old Republic. But there may be a slight glimmer of hope.


According to a notable Bloomberg report by Jason Schreier, the remake is still going ahead. While trying to make sense of Embracer's "divestment" of the studio – in which he refers to the deal as being "a little misleading" – user @WhatsAkeo asks whether KOTOR is still in the pipeline.




The response is simply: "Yes that’s going with Saber." Further questioning from user @VinderTomat prompts Schreier to assume that the "previously unannounced AAA game based on a major license" noted in the recent Embracer Group press release must be in reference to the remake. Schreier adds: "It’s the only game that fits."


So, there you have it, folks. We still don't know whether Knights...is making a comeback. Willits hasn't exactly denied it's still in development, but a reputable journalist seems confident says it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not quite legendary, though.
A few years ago, FuRyu released The Alliance Alive HD Remastered for Switch—an uprezzed port of a great RPG that was sadly missed by most due to releasing on the 3DS after most players had already moved on to Switch. Yet The Alliance Alive was not the company’s first release on Nintendo’s old handheld; that honor belonged to The Legend of Legacy. This initial release debuted to a divisive reception in 2015 (we awarded it an 8/10 in our review), but evidently the Alliance Alive remaster did well enough to warrant giving its predecessor a second chance with The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered. Though we would still say this is the weaker of the two, FuRyu did a great job of polishing up this overlooked 3DS dungeon crawler; it’s not a stellar example of this genre, but fans will be sure to find plenty to love here.
Legend of Legacy doesn’t feature very much of a story, which may come as a disappointment to many players. After picking one of seven potential characters, you travel to the mysterious island of Avalon—a recently discovered landmass that rumors say is the home to a grand, ancient treasure. Each of the seven has their own reasons for coming to Avalon, and as you explore its various dungeons, you’ll slowly uncover artifacts revealing bits of lore detailing the civilization that once thrived there, the events that ultimately led to its downfall, and the unique ways in which the seven protagonists are tied to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in January, we received the first glimpse of things to come in Palworld with the mini-roadmap, and now we’ve received news of the first new content to be added to the game — the Bellanoir raid. 


Palworld players have been wondering when new content would be arriving, with recent patches being dedicated to bug fixes and optimization, but the wait is nearly over.


PocketPair announced the upcoming raid on Twitter and Discord, along with the following video:




From what we can see, this raid will be triggered by players playing something that looks very much like a Pal Soul on a plinth, triggering the appearance of Bellanoir.


All the info we have on Bellanoir


We don’t know much about Bellanoir, such as its type, attacks, or weaknesses, but just from its name and appearance (and this is only speculation), I’d guess that it’s likely to be a Dark x Fire type. 


Also backing this theory is the fire and brimstone which falls from the sky when the plinth is activated. The player in the showcase video is accompanied by a range of Pals, so there aren’t any hints there. 





According to two recently added achievements on Steam, there will also be a variant of Bellanoir, called Bellanoir Libero, although no images or information are currently available of this variant.





We also have no news as to when this raid will actually arrive in-game, as the only information from PocketPair on that point is that the raid is “coming soon”. That said, it’s unlikely that we’ll have long to wait and hopefully this new Pal will be coming to Palpagos sooner, rather than later. 


With news of the Palworld Testing Program announced recently, as well, there are high hopes that more content is on the way and this is the first sign that Palworld players will soon have more to occupy their time, outside of the Breeding Farm.

This is ongoing until it gets released on March 19 (next Tuesday). In the meantime, modders should be ready for the changes.


In a recent post on Nexus Mods – one of the biggest repositories for game modifications and custom content – the site is gearing people up for version 1.6 of Stardew Valley. While there's excitement inbound, especially given the tweaks and new content that's a-coming, anyone who mods the game is being asked to prepare.




According to the post, a "considerable chunk of mods will be broken" after the game updates. While data shows that around 44% of mods for version 1.5.6 should be compatible with 1.6, that leaves more than half that likely won't be.


How can I – a modder – prepare?


Nexus says that some are already hard at work, making sure the update is as "seamless as possible between 1.5 and 1.6 for mod authors." It also seems as though migrating over should be pretty forward. The site has provided a link to a migration guide to help people out.


For anyone who's not looking to make their Stardew mods compatible just yet, it's recommended to put "a note in either your description or pinned comments to that effect to help offset the flood of questions about the update from users."


As for general users, it's possible to filter the mods to only show ones that will work with 1.6. Looking at it currently, there are 41 that should work once the patch rolls out. However, that does mean over 14,000 will need a bit of work.

The weapons on this tier are perhaps the best of the best and can be taken to almost any scenario in Helldivers 2, including the harder difficulties like Suicide Mission and higher. These are the S-Tier weapons in Helldivers 2:

Like with the previous Warbond, Steeled Veterans, you can only acquire the Cutting Edge Warbond by purchasing it with 1,000 Super Credits. If you haven't farmed enough Super Credits in Helldivers 2, you'll have to make up for the cost with real-life cash. It costs $9.99 for 1,000 Super Credits, mind.


The theme of the pack is high-tech, so expect all weapons and gear to revolve around electricity and lasers.

Following the rough launch of Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which is an HD port combo of the original Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II on modern consoles and PC, developer Aspyr Media says it's working to address issues and increase network stability. 
Shortly after the game's launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them.

Additionally, there are crossplay references in there and some other findings include evidence of Linux and Steam Deck versions. This was originally spotted by PC_Focus on social media.

High-quality spin-offs shall be combined as the hugely successful Netflix show from CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger will join forces with the innovative Combat Zone skirmish game from Monster Fight Club. If you watched Cyberpunk Edgerunners and thought, "I would love to take this goddamn rollercoaster of a tv show and the characters I love so much and watch them duke it out on the mean streets of Night City in the miniature form," then you are in luck. The heart-wrenching mini-series is being converted into tabletop form by the delightful folks behind the Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone game that launched last year. 





Combat Zone quickly became one of my favor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are several armor perks in Helldivers 2, all of which provide some additional benefit to the player wearing them. The best, in my opinion, is Democracy Protects because it gives you a better chance of survival when being overwhelmed, with a 50% chance of not dying from lethal damage and prevents all bleeding damage from the chest. 


Players also have a diverse range of tools to play around with in Helldivers 2. My favorites tend to be anything that'll set the Terminids on fire, while others prefer to use explosives. With the release of the Cutting Edge Warbond, players discovered a new technique they could use to wipe out enemies in a flash. The Electrical Conduit armor perk.

The game's universe is built around the idea that Helldivers are being thrown at enemies until those enemies are beaten. The more bodies, the better. 


However, this gameplay loop falls apart when reinforcements don't work. Other players must use a Reinforcement Stratagem to call a new soldier into the fray for you to control, and without that soldier, you're useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new release from developer PlaywithFurcifer, Backpack Battles, has reached a massive milestone in a very short time frame, selling 100,000 units in under two days. It’s flying high on Steam charts right now, hanging in there as we approach what will be only the game's second weekend since launch. 




In the above post on Twitter, Furcifer celebrated the milestone and shared excitement over the news. 


Backpack Battles are described as a “PvP inventory management auto-battler” in which you can combine items that have been crafted or purchased by placing them next to each other in your backpack. Certain combinations result in powerful items, which can then be used to cause damage to your opponents. 


At the time of writing, Backpack Battles has reached a peak of more than 35,000 consecutive players within the last 24 hours, ranking it one place below Overwatch 2 in the Steam Most Played charts.

Backpack Battles is also doing well when it comes to reviews, which currently sit at ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ with over 3,000 reviews and a thriving Subreddit. That favor already has a dedicated, helpful community as players pool resources toward discovering new combinations and strategies for tougher battles. 


It's another indie gem catching our eye this year, with other favorites taking off just a couple of months into 2024. Balatro, the roguelike deckbuilder from developer LocalThunk, sold more than 250,000 copies within the first three days. That said, this number was obtained across a multitude of platforms, whereas Backpack Battles is only available on Steam. 


Currently, you can currently purchase Backpack Battles on its own for $11.69 USD, or there are two bundles available:



Backpack Battles + Slay the Spire ($33.01 USD)


Backpack Battles + Brotato ($15.01 USD)

The Mace, also regarded as "a hammer," excels in falling attacks, where players must test their luck on elevated terrain. All you have to do is jump off a hill or cliff and then land a strike on a mob while falling for extra damage. While it does sound pretty dangerous, fall damage is, fortunately, negated when the attack lands. I, for one, will probably end up dying multiple times, but that's the price you have to pay for Minecraft experiments. 




In addition to the negated fall damage, a knockback effect applies when the strike lands, sending those …]]></summary>

How to use the Supply Pack in Helldivers 2


To use a Supply Pack and resupply while on the field, you need to purchase and equip the Supply Pack Stratagem in Helldivers 2. You unlock it in the Ship Management system under the 'Stratagems' tab in the 'Engineering Bay' section. It's available at level 2, and you can purchase it for a mere 4,000 Requisition Slips. You can find the Supply Pack Stratagem in between the Anti-Personnel Minefield and Grenade Launcher Stratagems in the Engineering Bay section.

Fix for stuttering and lag in Helldivers 2


The solution that seems to work for most players to fix stuttering in Helldivers 2 is to lock your FPS. For some reason, a recent Helldivers 2 update is causing some players to get stuttering and lag when their FPS is not locked.


To lock your FPS in Helldivers 2, simply enter the Options menu, go to Display, and enable Framerate Limit. Then, make sure you set the Framerate Limit to match whatever your refresh rate is. For most people, this is 60FPS, though it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Normal-type Castform features many variants depending on the weather, from bright Sunny to gloomy Rainy forms. Those who are lucky may even stumble upon a Shiny rendition, primarily when an event is active. So, if you want to catch this exclusive creature, here's how to get a Shiny Castform in Pokemon Go.


Where to find Shiny Castform in Pokemon Go


Players will increase their chances of a Shiny Castform by finding them during Weather Week or completing Weather-themed tasks. The event lasts until March 18, 2024, at 8 PM local time, spawning more Castforms into the wilds. According to the Pokémon official website, Weather-themed Field Research tasks produce more encounters with all of the creature's forms, regardless of weather conditions. If you don't see these specific tasks on the board, delete the current objectives and spin PokéStops to trigger their appearance:


Screenshot by Destructoid


The three tasks included in the Pokémon Go Weather Week Field Research are as follows:



Catch 5 Pokémon with Weather Boost


Catch 7 Pokémon with Weather Boost


Catch 10 Pokémon with Weather Boost



Weather Boosts depend on the conditions of your current area. If it's sunny, certain Pokémon will have a sun icon when capturing them, indicating that the boost is active. The symbol won't always appear, so keep capturing them until all the needs are met. The more Field Research tasks are completed, the more chances you'll get for a Shiny Castform. 


Castform showcases a total of four forms: Normal, Sunny, Rainy, and Snowy. Typically, you can only get these creatures with the corresponding weather conditions, but it's not a requirement for Weather Week. While the event is active, I recommend obtaining as many Castforms as possible in the hopes of getting its Shiny form. Fortunately, spawns are frequent, so it could be possible to get all four variants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an "innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG."
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature "unique cooperative gameplay," the studio says. 
"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn," the announcement reads." 
There's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here.

That's undeniably true, because it's Nintendo's bread and butter, with characters such as Mario and Princess Peach starring in fantastic games appealing to a younger audience. 


However, the Switch is far from a console exclusively for kids. In fact, there are some amazing games for adults on it that regularly stop us from putting it down for far too many hours.

Below, I've listed out what I believe to be the best Nintendo Switch games for adults. While not all of them are exclusively hardcore RPGs, with hundreds of hours required to finish their campaigns, each one has a world in which you can lose yourself.

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

The Pokémon Company is no stranger to leaving hints about what's to come in their games. Normally, these are only noticed in retrospect and, as it turns out, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet appear to contain a nod towards the company's next title, Legends: Z-A (thanks, Eurogamer).
The tease in question was initially flagged on the r/PokemonZA Reddit by user KyleLaverre, who spotted some familiar text when exploring Levincia in Scarlet and Violet's Paldea region. You see, there's a sign at the front of a tall Levincian building which appears to use the same mysterious lettering as that seen in the opening of the Legends: Z-A reveal trailer.

That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds' eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic's world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…]]></summary>

They don't have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won't be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it's headed to PC and consoles.

While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a "joint project" between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won't be out in the next 12 months. Given the project's repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

You've ploughed fields on Switch, you've power washed cars on Switch, and now, you can mow lawns on Switch. Yes, the latest in a line of 'I didn't know I needed that' sims is here as Lawn Mowing Simulator (and its 'Landmark Edition' deluxe version) trims its way to Switch today.
You don't really need us to tell you what Lawn Mowing Simulator entails, do you? You cut lawns. That's it. Okay, actually, there is a little more than that. As well as getting out in the field, you will be building your "lawn mowing empire" (yes, really) by hiring employees, purchasing new machines and keeping an eye on the all-important finances.

        <updated>2024-03-14T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you're a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you'll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio's first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

With so many incredible games now available on the Switch, it's natural that you might be in the market for a micro SD card to boost your storage capacity beyond the measly 64GB afforded by the Switch OLED (or 32 GB if you're using an OG model).
What our lovely video producer Alex has demonstrated, however, is that not all SD card manufacturers can be trusted; particularly those that promote cheap products with seemingly large storage capacities. Spotted a 1TB card for less than 20 quid? Sounds delightful, right? Well, not quite.

Europe's next Nintendo Switch Online free Game Trial kicks off today and it is none other than Poncle's devilishly addictive roguelike, Vampire Survivors. From today (14th March) until 23rd March, you can get into as much of the monster-hunting mayhem as you would like, for free! That is, as long as you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, of course.
If you have somehow managed to last this long without picking up Vampire Survivors, we can't recommend it highly enough. The game is a tough sell. It's a top-down, pixel-art roguelike where you kill hoards of monsters with a series of ever-upgrading auto-firing weapons, but on launch last year, we couldn't put it down.

After checking the game out for a few hours alongside some of the leads at Moon Studios in Vienna, Austria, last month, cover story writer and Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart and I have a pretty good idea about what to expect from No Rest for the Wicked's early access release – you can read my preview thoughts here and his cover story here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. 
For more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right. After that, check out this guide about how to beat Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's hardest platforming challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some respects, Helldivers 2 did come as a bit of surprise. Not a huge amount of marketing, no betas, and review codes didn't go out until it basically launched. Before it landed on my PC, there was a small part of me that thought it was going to be a rocky ride with severe performance issues or the like. Nope! It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.
But there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.

This was surprising, because while I'd been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a "Shrieker Lair" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like "smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze." 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

Exploding into coins upon death notwithstanding, and to be clear, rad as hell. Happily, its Season 2 update is all about rewriting the rules of its glistening digital battlefields.

Chandlers's trademark "blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window" kind of zingers are very hard to do well, so it's better to say you're doing Philip Marlow badly on purpose. The trailer for Nobody Wants To Die seems like it's self-seriousness is actually self-awareness. I mean, I kind of refuse to believe that hard-boiled future crime detective James Karra saying "I'm in the business of secrets... But it's more of an addiction... And I like 'em straight... No chaser..." while sipping from a glass of amber liquor isn't indulging in some amount of winking and nudging.

        <updated>2024-03-13T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure," a press release reads. "The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon." 
As you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development.

        <updated>2024-03-13T12:30:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 


"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. 


For more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" with a 12-hour battery life. After that, read about how the PS5 surpassed 50 million units in December, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 PS5 games to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stealth games in which you can become "one with the shadows" cover a wide range, though I guess spectrum is the more appropriate word here. You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.
There are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.


The point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

A court in Barcelona has indeed authorized LaLiga to obtain the identities of subscribers at five major ISPs, but if our reading of court documents is accurate, LaLiga hasn't identified any, even by their IP addresses. As unlikely as it may sound, LaLiga may have no evidence that any subscriber did anything wrong, so ISPs have been instructed to find some.

Originally released on PC on May 30, 2023, Night Dive and publisher Prime Matter revealed today that System Shock hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 21, just shy of the game's one-year anniversary. 
This reveal comes by way of a new trailer over at IGN, which teases some of the sci-fi horror and first-person shooting players can expect in the game. Check it out for yourself below in the System Shock consoles release date trailer: 


The remake today is in great shape on PC, and players should expect a well-made retread of the classic game. This remake had been in the works for years before its PC release last year – check out the game in a pre-alpha state in 2016 here.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/12/final-fantasy-xs-theme-song-to-zanarkand-wasnt-originally-intended-for-the-game"/>
        <updated>2024-03-12T16:25:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is "To Zanarkand" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. 
This news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed "To Zanarkand" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. 


"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X," Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. "There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. 
"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'" 
In retrospect, it's wild "To Zanarkand" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. 
For more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:
Part 1: Creating The Prelude
Part 2: The Victory Fanfare
Part 3: Finding A Main Theme
Part 4: The Sound
After that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster.

While Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. 


"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years," board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. "Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
Goeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, "Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy."
Goeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. 


Payday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios co-founder and tech and production director Gennadiy Korol has revealed the team's upcoming action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked, which is also the game on Game Informer's cover this month, will not require an online connection to play single-player. Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.
What's more, Korol says the game will feature "a rich Offline Mode" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.


Korol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. 
"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal," Korol writes. "Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign." 


Game Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.
Read about No Rest for the Wicked's early access roadmap and Cerim's Crucible endgame content after that, and for even more exclusive content, head to Game Informer's No Rest for the Wicked coverage hub.

The developers have also lowered the health of the Charger’s head, allowing for instant takedowns with a Recoilless Rifle or EAT-17, without (in theory) entirely doing away with the community’s treasured "leg meta", which sees players blasting the juggernaut’s limbs to sabotage it.

In the early 2000s, tennis video games were everywhere. Whether you were talking mass-appeal titles like Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis or more niche, lower-budget games like Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament and Hard Hitter Tennis, the market was absolutely flooded with choices. One of the most beloved of this era was 2003's Top Spin, which started as an Xbox exclusive before making the leap to PS2 and PC in subsequent years. Since that inaugural game, Top Spin has seen three more numbered entries, all receiving high review scores.

The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an "agnostic", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very "arcadey" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From theater productions on and off Broadway to TV shows like Ms. Marvel, actress Anjali Bhimani has done a bit of everything, but readers of Game Informer most likely recognize her work voice acting in video games. She's best known as Symmetra in Overwatch, which is a game role many young voice actors would strive their entire careers to get. Bhimani lucked out; it was the first time she ever acted in a game.
"All I knew is I'm doing the new game for Blizzard," Bhimani says. "And I knew that Blizzard was, you know, no slouch. They've done a lot of really cool things before, so chances were this was gonna be really cool. But I had no idea. I don't think anyone really did."

It seems that the earlier battle royale game is planning to borrow at least one leaf from its rival’s playbook this year, though.

In Brazil, a deal between MPA and ANCINE was effectively torn up for allegedly prioritizing U.S. content over that produced locally in Brazil.

Plus the Moomin merch I'd seen over the years in official Moomin shops or the odd gift store was delightful, so if someone had rocked up with a pencil case adorned with Moomin heads back in school, you bet I would've been jealous.
And having finished the game, I'm unsure whether I've truly learned any more about the Moomins and their friends. But then again, I've come away thinking that it's a pleasant universe to spend a few hours in, where the wild is celebrated with rebellious song. If you're after the video game equivalent of a walk through the woods on a warm afternoon, Moominvalley is the place to wander.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.
Player First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.
Every existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.
Lastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” 


MultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” 
Unfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
Are you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new week has slouched into view, and with it a slight shift in The Maw's terrifying visage. A new presence can be seen through the mist, perched on its shoulder, whispering tendrils of video game news nuggets into its greedy, hungry ear. The Maw appears sated, but will the distraction hold while we await the return of our news editor Edwin, whose long weekend sojourns won't conclude until tomorrow? We pray and hope it will be satisfied in this relatively quiet week of game releases and newsy happenings, lest it turn its awful gaze upon us with a wrathful vengeance. FEED THE MAW.

The games join the Game Boy library, which is included with the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 a year).
Dr. Mario from Game Boy, Mario Golf from Game Boy Color, and Mario Tennis from Game Boy Color join the Switch Online Game Boy catalog. The collection already includes the likes of Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, Kirby's Dream Land 2, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX, Tetris, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons, and Metroid II – Return of Samus. Oddly enough, the library is missing all of the Pokémon titles, as well as the original Super Mario Land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Released more than a decade ago, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is a little tricky to go back to in 2024 thanks to its 3DS exclusivity. However, during last September's Nintendo Direct, we learned that this well-liked sequel is making the leap to Switch as Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, joining the third entry in the hybrid console's catalog. Today, Nintendo announced that Luigi and his Poltergust 5000 will return to Switch in June.
When it arrived on 3DS in 2013, it received strong review scores, including an 8.5 from Game Informer. This sequel actually involves the younger Mario Bro visiting a series of mansions to capture ghosts and rescue Mario from King Boo. You can see the reveal trailer for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD below.


Luigi's Mansion 2 HD arrives on Nintendo Switch on June 27. If you just can't wait to bust ghosts as Mario's brother, be sure to check out Luigi's Mansion 3, which is perhaps one of the most underrated first-party games on Switch. You can read our review of Luigi's Mansion 3 here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beloved GameCube RPG, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, finally has a release date for Switch. Announced during September 2023's Nintendo Direct, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is regarded by many as the pinnacle of Mario's RPG outings, and since today is Mario Day, Nintendo took the opportunity to let fans know when they'd be able to play the remaster on Nintendo's hybrid console.
We still don't have many details for this version, but we do know that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door features improved graphics. It joins a collection of titles starring Mario and his friends over the last several months, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Princess Peach: Showtime, and the upcoming Luigi's Mansion 2 HD.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/10/new-super-mario-bros-animated-movie-announced-for-2026-release"/>
        <updated>2024-03-10T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.
While the announcement stops short of calling this "Super Mario Bros. 2" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. "As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more," Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. "This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.
What do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

Well, allow us both to be reminded of something from over a decade ago, because the Watch Dogs film is still apparently A Thing. It’s more of A Thing now, too, because it has actual names attached rather than just a corporation’s vague “excitement” about licensing out its IP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While speaking to Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida in Square Enix's Tokyo, Japan, offices last year for Game Informer's cover story on the game, he told me there was currently no plans for DLC. However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. 
The first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game. While we still don't know when to expect The Rising Tide other than this spring, I spoke to Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about what players can expect and more, and you can read about that in my preview here.

That doesn't mean, though, that I don't appreciate something light and simple now and then. In fact, Minami Lane might barely qualify as a management game by some standards.
There's no real pressure, no chance of failure, and its limit of a handful of levels lasting perhaps three or four hours just about taps it out. But sometimes such limitations are intentional, and exactly what you want from a game.

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.
Which brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.

The news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.

Akira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. 
Upcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. 
Toryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.
Game Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.]]></summary>

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going "Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute."
"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis," reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.

Sometimes, a great idea can come from a simple premise. That’s how Son and Bone, the next game from TeamKill Media, the studio behind last year’s Quantum Error, came to be: a first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. Inspired by the dormant Turok series, TeamKill’s lead developer Micah Jones remarks about a joke the studio’s fans have made since the reveal of its dinosaur shooter at the top of the year. “They say, ‘If other game companies won’t do it, these developers will,’” Jones says, explaining that everyone on the team is a big fan of the Turok series.
After watching roughly 10 minutes of new Son and Bone gameplay, the Turok inspiration is…]]></summary>

I don't have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it's very funny that the list goes, like, "beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s". Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.

Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of launching Dragon's Dogma 2 later this month, Capcom have released its character creator for free as a separate standalone doodad. You can create your character and your main Pawn (NPC sidekick) and save them to use in the full game. Or, if you're like me and cannot resist playing for hours in a character creator, you can enjoy fiddling with its many sliders and marvelling at the breadth of options like 334 different colours for its four eye colour settings and the ability to remove individual teeth. I made my kitten as my pal, because I guess that's what I do now.

Coming off the success of Sonic Mania, the development team behind one of the best games in Sega’s storied series is back with an all-new franchise. Much like how the studio now known as Evening Star’s previous effort was a love letter to a bygone era of platforming, Penny’s Big Breakaway is a fond tribute to the 3D platformers of the late ‘90s. Evening Star clearly knows how to design a fantastic new entry in this well-worn genre, but some important issues drag down an otherwise strong game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. 


The game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as "Beloved" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.

But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week's podcast. Plus: we've been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.
This first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite: Chapter 5 was a huge launch for the long-running battle royale developed by Epic Games. Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.
As Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. 
Prepare thyselves, mere mortals!

Unfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. 
In the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month. After that, read about how Disney and Epic Games are partnering up to create a games and entertainment universe connected to Fortnite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.
It was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/07/helldivers-2-season-2-launches-next-week-with-new-cutting-edge-warbond"/>
        <updated>2024-03-07T14:57:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new "Cutting Edge" Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with "high-voltage vibes," giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. 
Warbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new "Acquisitions" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. 
Check out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: 


Within this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with "wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts." The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the "end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'"
In terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. 
You can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. 

Elsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. 
Cutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios has released the first official trailer for its upcoming Fallout TV series and unsurprisingly, it features power armor, a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Vault Dwellers, and plenty more. And it looks great. Today's trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. 
The trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell's Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins' Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan's mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten's Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: 


"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have," a press release reads. "200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them." 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer's reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

However, I recently had the chance to meet with publisher Bandai Namco and developer Reflector Entertainment to learn more about the game and see the first gameplay footage.

After we finally got a proper look at 11 bit Studios' beautifully brutal follow-up last year, we now know when we’ll be able to brave the unforgiving tundra and the nightmarish climate of, uh, July?

The result wasn't close but was closer than I expected, which shows why it's important to ask. We're doing important work here, you and I. This week, it's a question of mitts. What's better: left-handed FPS options or a little hand for a cursor?

But their latest venture - created in partnership with developers Chibig and Inverge Studios, and co-written by Rhianna Pratchett - is drastically different. Titled Creatures Of Ava, it's a fantasy game about saving Pokémon-like creatures, as opposed to, well, imprisoning them and using them for labour (Palworld, I'm looking at you).

The new and extremely damp survival horror game, set in a heavily flooded New England city in the 1920s, is pivoting the studio to a "'horror-first' focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration and its Lovecraftian setting and story". This is a step away from the studio's mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let's peer through the weeds a bit further.

I was one of the folks who wasn't so hot on what we'd played, and I'd hoped that the early access version would prove me wrong.
Alas, I am sad to report that I still do not like Nightingale. From what I've played so far, the game is an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind, which makes you feel divorced from the very world you inhabit.

The patch nerfs three of what were hitherto the best Helldivers 2 guns and gear pieces - the SG-225 Breaker shotgun, the RS-422 railgun, and the SH-32 shield generator backpack, all of which break Arrowhead's pretty straightforward golden rule that "each gun has its purpose and none is strictly better than another".

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>
