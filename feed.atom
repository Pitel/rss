There was reportedly one "new Wii U" sold in the US last month and it was the first time a new Wii U has been sold in this location since May 2022.
This sales data comes from Circana (formerly The NPD Group) via industry analyst Mat Piscatella. What does it mean exactly? Not much, but it is admittedly a surprise that there's still some new stock floating about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, this is just Trubbish. The Van Gogh Museum, which recently held a Pokemon collab that got a bit hectic, announced it will no longer distribute its Pikachu promo card at the physical exhibit starting October 14. If you want the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat collaboration card, you'll have to shop online for a qualifying purchase. 


As spotted by PokeJungle, the Van Gogh Museum explained it's no longer offering the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat promo card in person thanks to "a small group of individuals" it says "created an undesirable situation." Without the chaos around the card giveaway, the museum believes fans can visit the Pokemon exhibit in a safe, enjoyable experience.

However, the Pokemon Center will have the Pikachu card available later for online shoppers in the USA, Canada, and the UK, but no date was given. It will also go to various retailers in the Netherlands sometime next year. 


The Museum also notes it's still selling merchandise at the exhibit; it's just the Van Gogh Pikachu dropping from its offerings. Those items are up in its online store, too. Restocks happen weekly, so don't panic if the Van Gogh Museum's online store hits you with an "out of stock" notice. 


Can't Catch a Break


When the Pokemon exhibit was announced late September, many were in love with the concept. I mean, who doesn't want to see a Post-Impressionist painting of Snorlax? As always, there were people who saw it as a means to make a quick buck. So, when the event happened, droves of people flooded the Amsterdam museum to get their hands on merch, causing quite a stir. This led to the Van Gogh Museum pausing sales and an apology from the Pokemon Company.


The exhibit is still around, so if you do want to go as a real fan, tickets are still available. The Pokemon x Van Gogh event runs until January 7.

What’s Gley? I’m assuming it’s an off-white color, similar to cleam or beice. If you guessed mistranslation, then that seems to be the case here. The Japanese language doesn’t have any distinction between “r” and “l” consonant sounds, so someone was so absolutely certain that they had translated it correctly that they put it on the title screen. Let's cut them some slack. The internet wasn't what it is now. It definitely gives it that ‘90s charm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's official: we have a new voice actor for Mario! And no, it isn't Chris Pratt. Rumors swirled about who might take up the Italian plumber's big shoes after longtime voice Charles Martinet announced his departure from the role. Well, it's now confirmed that Mario, as well as Luigi, will be played by voice actor Kevin Afghani in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. It's unknown if he will play the role in future titles.




This news comes a week before the highly-anticipated release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which will now mark Kevin's first appearance as the beloved icon. Nintendo themselves, as reported by The Verge, confirmed his role in an email sent out to them. The reveal of Mario and Luigi's new voice lines up with Doug Bowser (not that Bowser) saying the actor would be revealed towards release. It also comes a day after data-miners, according to Kotaku, managed to find the cast list through demos available at various Target locations.


In terms of Kevin Afghani's work, he hasn't done too much. His biggest role on IMDb lists Arnold in Genshin Impact. He's also done some YouTube skits for the video-game-based animation channel MASHED. It's a very impressive feat for someone to become the next face of Mario early in their career. I can speak for a lot of people when I say that we can't wait to see what Kevin can do and wish him the best. 


Super Mario Bros. Wonder releases on Nintendo Switch on October 20.

While I generally detest using the “like” nomenclature, it’s hard to deny that FromSoftware made some very specific tweaks to the action-RPG genre that keep getting lifted wholesale. I was recently perturbed by Lies Of P essentially just lifting Bloodborne, sprinkling some variations from other Souls games, and then just calling it a day. I have trouble applauding someone for just copying the successes of another company wholesale.


But I’m not against the soulslike genre, in general. A developer just needs to put their own twist on things. Take Another Crab’s Treasure, for example. There is a lot of Souls DNA mixed in here.

Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani," Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!

Afghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.

And both give players new gameplay concepts and abilities that expand the original franchise vision in unprecedented ways. However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario's claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series' fates are forever intertwined. Sonic Superstars arrives on all consoles (including Switch) on October 17, just days before Super Mario Bros. Wonder lands exclusively on Switch on October 2…]]></summary>

The organization sees shadow libraries, including LibGen and Sci-Hub, as key problems, with the relatively new meta-search engine Anna's Archive also getting a mention. Third-party intermediaries pose problems too, the publishers note, with abuse of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as a growing concern.

My adoration for this franchise extends even to the SNES titles. Specifically, I enjoyed the first SMT game and played some of its sequel on the same system. 


There are definitely issues with these titles, ranging from Zio-breaking bosses to barren dungeons, but these games have a vibe. There's something about exploring a desolate world, using computers to summon demons, and becoming a formidable force. The soundtrack is pretty killer, too. 


It's just a shame that the only official way to play the first SMT in the West is on older iOS devices. These older installments have a feel …]]></summary>

The demo sets you free to complete simple objectives that eventually open up into a larger, interwoven mystery. It's all vaguely interesting from the start, but it's the off-kilter sketchbook visuals that make me want to explore further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TikTok is no stranger to the occasional odd duet chain, but one of the more recent ones is recreating Kakariko Village from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and, to be honest, I am here for it.




It all started on September 29, when user Amanda Kaya uploaded a video playing the Kakariko Village theme on the guitar. Shortly thereafter, another user named Jay dueted Kaya with a melodica rendition of the theme’s recognizable melody line. From there, a particularly delectable brand of chaos began to take root as various users added their own videos to the chain, either providing sound effects or recreating the downright odd behavior of NPCs in the hit Nintendo 64 adventure.


It was one thing for user marce_chiriboga to provide the chickens and horse sound effects that sound as if they were ripped straight from the game, but it was another thing entirely when user Megs added their version of the infamous Master Craftsman and when user Tim Settineri contributed their take on the Beggar character — you know, the character who keeps patting their legs and raising their arms to the sky in an endless loop? There’s even a user who added a very, very slow-moving windmill.


I often find that the internet has inspired the worst in humanity to bubble up to the surface. But, then I see the internet collaborating on this silly, but creative, duet chain and I am led to believe — as long as things like this continue to exist, maybe we’re gonna be alright. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go play The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the 50,000th time.

Sledgehammer Games released the MW3 multiplayer beta for players to preview ahead of the game’s full launch, complete with several game modes and maps to explore. 


At its core, the Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer beta feels like this strange mashup of the old and new. On the one hand, so many aspects about this latest title center on the original maps from 2009’s Modern Warfare 2 and the look 2022’s MW2. But on the opposite end, it features its own mix of new features like new movement and weapons. These aspects results in a mixed but somewhat promising new release.

The game is set to fire onto Switch on 24th October in North America and 27th October in Europe and we have been wowed by its stunning visuals and dazzling combat with each trailer that we have seen. Adding to the hype, you can check out an all-new demo trailer above, which showcases some of the robot rivalries that will be in store.

There are 1,320 reviews at the time of writing, and they are Mostly Negative, which is quite the showing for a game's first day on sale.

You drive a selection of vehicles across an increasingly ludicrous desert while everything in the universe tries to stop you. But you have guns. Or flamethrowers.

Join us today on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

As the bare buttocks of returning Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga indicated in the reveal trailer for Infinite Wealth, we’re not in Yokohama anymore, but Honolulu, Hawaii. He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. 
Alas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.

As a result, Xbox's stable of IPs and game franchises has become much larger, welcoming the likes of Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more. 
While many know Activision Blizzard as the company behind industry juggernauts like Call of Duty and Overwatch, the company is home to plenty more games. In light of today's news, we've decided to create an easy place to see every Activision Blizzard game franchise that Xbox now owns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been an exceptionally eventful day over at Activision Blizzard's slice of the gaming world. In an email to staff, Bobby Kotick revealed that he is stepping down as CEO of Activision Blizzard after 32 years of leading the company. This news comes following the announcement that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard is complete. 


Kotick isn't leaving immediately, and he'll remain CEO until the end of 2023. During this time, he'll be reporting to Xbox CEO Phil Spencer to facilitate the company's integration into the Xbox family of first-party studios.

New days for Activision Blizzard


In Kotick's email, he expresses a positive attitude toward the acquisition, claiming it will allow Activision Blizzard to "deliver more fun, more joy, and more connection to more players than ever before." He also mentions several of the industry-defining franchises that have come from the company, including Call of Duty, Guitar Hero, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater.


Following the acquisition, Activision Blizzard also released a public statement revealing how, as Xbox's team, it'll continue its mission to "deliver the world’s most epic interactive entertainment experiences to more people, more platforms, and across more worlds than ever before." 


Kotick's career as Activision Blizzard CEO has been an eventful one filled with plenty of successes, including the acquisition of Candy Crush developer King in 2015. However, he has also been the subject of controversy, and there have been reports that he was aware of instances of sexual assault in the workplace. 


We already have an idea of what will come from the acquisition, as Activision Blizzard announced that we can expect more of its games to hit Game Pass next year.

This means that a cornucopia of big franchises, from "Pitfall to Call of Duty, World of Warcraft to Overwatch, Candy Crush Saga to Farm Heroes Saga" now fall under the Xbox banner.


It appears that Microsoft may finally have its toes over the finish line when it comes to acquiring Activision Blizzard. The process began in 2022, and Microsoft has had to navigate several obstacles since then to finalize the deal. After plenty of negotiating, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has given its consent for the acquisition to close.

Earlier today, Microsoft officially acquired Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick revealed he will remain as CEO through the end of the year after Xbox head Phil Spencer asked him to stay to help with the company transition. While staying through the end of the year presumes Kotick will depart from the company in 2024, that remained technically unknown.
However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says that Kotick will depart from Activision Blizzard, a company he took over 33 years ago, on January 1, 2024.

The news comes after the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved the proposed acquisition following Microsoft's amendment to the deal, foregoing cloud rights to Activision Blizzard's portfolio and handing them over to Ubisoft.

And having seen those, you may have come to Nintendo Life looking for our verdict on the Switch version. And having seen this article on the homepage, you're now wondering where the devil it is...
Unfortunately, we haven't yet received Switch review code for Sonic Superstars. We were kindly supplied pre-launch code for the game on PlayStation, so we've been able to familiarise ourselves with it beyond our hands-on time at Summer Game Fest back in June, but crucially we haven't yet played the Switch version and therefore can't deliver our review alongside other outlets.

One of Superstars’ biggest selling points is to take down Eggman with up to three other players. Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After being announced in July 2022 and delayed in August 2023, it looks like the planned remake of Lollipop Chainsaw is switching gears. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda announced as much on Twitter, saying they've "changed the game design of RePOP from remake to remaster." Without sharing any details, Yasuda added that this decision was based on "requests."




The recent delay of Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP was put in place to provide "the best possible quality experience." Originally planned as a remake and set for sometime in 2023, Dragami Games then changed that window to summer 2024. The original game by Grasshopper Manufacture served as a collaboration between Suda 51 and James Gunn. It launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 back in 2012.

Oh, Juliet


So, why exactly is this changing from a remake to a remaster? Dragami Games made a point of addressing concerns over changes in the past. Shortly after the announcement, Yasuda reassured fans, saying they don't plan on changing the story or aesthetics in the remake. That included pushing back against "baseless assumptions" that the team wanted to change protagonist Juliet's design. Then there was the whole question about censorship, which Yasuda said would be addressed in negotiations with platform holders.


Basically, the more fans asked, the more Yasuda attempted to assuage their fears, noting that they plan to keep everything as close to the original as possible. Now they're taking things one step further with the move from remake to remaster. The only remaining sticking points are all those licensed songs. Yasuda previously said they were unable to include 16 of those songs. We'll have to see what else is planned for the remaster as further details are divulged.

Earlier this morning, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority approved Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The CMA was the last hurdle for Microsoft's acquisition after it received approval in more than 40 countries and regions, including the U.S. earlier this summer. The deadline for Microsoft to close this deal was October 18, but reports indicated the company was planning to finalize it today, October 13. That has now happened, and Activision Blizzard is officially part of Xbox's first-party studio umbrella.

Mario is riding an Inchworm Pipe.
The latest in Nintendo's range of short adverts for the game (you might remember Bowser wooing Elephant Peach earlier this week) sees Mario setting off on one of Wonder's newest modes of transport: a crawling pipe. As it turns out, this thing is actually called an Inchworm Pipe (yes, really) and while it seems to be a cool way to get around, it clearly isn't the fastest method...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To craft Cyberpunk 2077's immersive world, plenty of voice actors were necessary. CD Projekt Red ran into a problem when Miłogost Reczek, a Polish performer who did the Polish voice acting for Viktor Vektor, passed away in 2021. As revealed by Bloomberg, the studio overcame this setback with the help of artificial intelligence. 


In a statement to Bloomberg, the studio explained that when developing the Polish language release of the Phantom Liberty DLC, it considered a few options regarding Vektor's voice. The studio mulled over replacing Reczek and re-recording his lines in the base game, but as CD Projekt Red localization director Mikołaj Szwed states, this idea was rejected in favor of AI which would keep Reczek's "performance in the game and pay tribute to his wonderful performance as Viktor Vektor."

How AI recreated Miłogost Reczek's voice in Cyberpunk 2077


To recreate Reczek's voice, CD Projekt Red first hired a new voice actor to record all the necessary lines for Phantom Liberty. Following this, a Ukraine-based voice-cloning software called Respeecher created an algorithm to alter the dialog to sound like Reczek. The use of AI in Phantom Liberty was done with permission from the Reczek family. According to Szwed, Reczek's sons were very supportive.


This isn't the first time Respeecher has been used in major AAA games. When developing God of War Ragnarok, Santa Monica had to use the software to keep Sunny Suljic's voice consistent throughout the development process. Suljic (born 2005) is the voice behind Atreus, and his changing voice was the consequence of a long development cycle extending across his growth spurt. 


Though AI can be exceptionally useful in game development, it does come with the possibility that it could permanently replace human voice actors. This has been a concern for SAG-AFTRA, which also represents performers in the gaming industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released an update of the Sand Land story trailer that focuses mostly on the English voice cast.


I’ve kept one eye on Sand Land, but not because it’s based on Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama. It’s mostly because the desert environment and assortment of vehicles remind me of my beloved Metal Max. The latest trailer shows off a bit more of the vehicles, with their combat being shown off in particular. I mean, we've seen this trailer before and even heard previews, but I just like tank combat.




As for the voices, they sure are speaking English. I kind of hate voiceovers in trailers because when they’re devoid of most of their context, it just feels off. Bandai Namco provided a list of who’s playing what role, and I had to look all of them up. Risa Mei is doing Beelzebub, John Lipow is on Rao (the ranger-looking guy), Owen Thomas is Thief, and Keith Silverstein is Lucifer. It’s an experienced cast, but no massive celebrities from other media, which is honestly preferable.


Sand Land is set in an expansive wasteland that has overtaken the planet in the wake of war and environmental disasters. Beelzebub joins a crew that seeks to find a source of water in the sun-blasted environment. It’s based on a 2000 serial comic from Weekly Shōnen Jump by Akira Toriyama. I’m just here for the tanks and vehicular exploration.


The release date for Sand Land release date is still to be announced, but it’s set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5.

You might find an hour to do a bit of scavenging, here and there - gathering mussels from the rocks at low tide, or putting aside some wood for that pier your dad asked you to build. Just, don't forget the gods. The gods have needs too. Today it's crabs. Tomorrow? Who knows.

But it's not alone; the Legend of Zelda series, which started around that time, also remains a genre leader all these decades later. During our discussions with Nintendo during our Super Mario Bros. Wonder cover story (and other interviews earlier this year), we tried to drill into why these franchises – in particular, the Mario franchise – have maintained their popularity and level of quality while so many other series have struggled to hold onto it for even a fraction of the time.
According to Mario series producer Takashi Tezuka, the tenure of the staff involved is a key part of keepin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 Community Director Adam Fletcher revealed on Twitter today that the ARPG will be Steam Deck Verified when it launches on Steam. Diablo 4 will be heading to Steam with the upcoming Season 2, Season of Blood. The second season releases on October 17 on all platforms, and will be the first time D4 is playable on Steam. The Store Page for the game on Steam has already been updated to indicate its verification.




This is honestly a pretty big move. The other Blizzard game that recently came to Steam, Overwatch 2, is Playable on Steam Deck but not Verified. One of the many issues players have with OW2 on Steam is its poor performance on Steam Deck.


The decision to make Diablo 4 Steam Deck Verified is a good one because the gameplay fits pretty naturally on a handheld device like the Steam Deck. The verification indicates that Valve has tested D4 on the device and can verify that it is fully functional and works great with the built-in controls and display.


A note on the verification page points out that the singleplayer gameplay will still require an active internet connection.


Diablo 4 comes to Steam and Steam Deck on October 17 with the launch of Season 2.

The game, based on the Spy x Family anime, is in the works for Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC, and it's essentially a minigame collection starring Anya. Yes, the littlest faux family member is adorable enough to deserve her own game. Their adopted, prescient dog, Bond, would do well as a playable hero, too. 


As a whole, though, Operation Memories looks like an appetizer of empty calories before a more substantial main course.


What we've seen so far isn't exactly bad, per se, but I'm anxious for the main course. A new trailer features spirited narration from the anime's cast as "Agent Anya-kun" gets to work. The telepathic tot exercises and cooks with Yor, feeds Uncle Yuri, takes test…]]></summary>

Indie devs clearly infatuated with the genre have been doing it justice, and the latest attempt is Maiden Cops. Take one part anthropomorphic animal anime girl and add a few dashes of Final Fight and River City Girls and you get the idea. What has me most interested in this one, however, is how it manages to capture the essence of a slightly offbeat home port of an arcade brawler.


A demo made its way online as part of Steam Next Fest, giving us a chance to check out a few hard-hitting areas. It's easy to see what Maiden Cops is going for from the first frame. You can choose from one of three Maiden Cops: Priscilla Salamander, Nina Usagi, and Meiga Holstaur. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, people who prefer their videogame graphics crispy rather than hazy and rainbow-edged! Ubisoft are working on an Assassin's Creed: Mirage patch that will let you toggle off chromatic aberration - aka the blurring of outlines and details for artistic effect, which you might consider appropriate to a game subtitled "Mirage", but which some people absolutely despise.

Well, the day has come, so what's the mind behind games like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and more to do next? Why, start a YouTube channel, of course! Kamiya went live with the appropriately named Hideki Kamiya Channel, and the first video is up in both Japanese and English. 


The outspoken, block-happy creator didn't waste any time getting to the question on everyone's minds. The inaugural video addresses why he quit PlatinumGames and what his plans are next. In fact, the first thing we see is Kamiya walking out with a box full of items from a freshly-cleared desk. "Oh well, I'm done (with Platinum)," he says. "I left. I'm over it. I'm so over it."

Specifically, I was thinking about Ken Silverman’s legendary Build Engine, a cluster of technical trickery that stands as, perhaps, the best 2.5D raycasting engine ever designed.


So, I was excited when Ion Fury popped up, doing just that. Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison was created as a stand-in for Duke Nukem, so it seems appropriate that Shelly (I’m not sure Bombshell is a nickname that will stick) would eventually make it to the engine that made him famous. Unfortunately, I couldn’t really get into it.


Then I tried again later and still couldn’t get into it.


Then I tried another time, and it still wasn’t clicking.

If you're not an indie fan, and you prefer your games to have high production value, you may be tempted to avoid the event altogether. However, you're highly advised to at least give Europa a shot, because it is one of the gems of Steam Next Fest that is quickly gaining attention online. 


The demo throws you onto Europa, which is one of Jupiter's moons. The landscape has been turned into a paradise teeming with alien plants and animals. It's a game that relies on minimalism when it comes to gameplay and storytelling. This will, naturally, turn some players off. However, if you have the patience for it, you may find the experience irresistibly alluring.

        <updated>2023-10-12T15:09:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage is now the biggest new-gen launch for Ubisoft, according to the official Assassin's Creed X account on Wednesday. The French publisher shared its Assassin's Creed Mirage sales news, noting figures include PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Ubisoft also provided some fun stats about our playtime.




Initial Assassin's Creed Mirage sales numbers seem impressive


"We are proud to [..] share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X-S)," said Ubisoft in a social media post thanking its audience. "A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


Ubisoft did not give specific numbers as to how Assassin's Creed Mirage has sold. However, we now know it has initially sold better in its first week than the likes of Watch Dogs: Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Immortals: Fenyx Rising.

Some of the stats celebrated the occasion are kind of fun, too. So far, players have spent 479 collective years parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad. Assassins also took 60 million Leaps of Faith. Then there's the most important, we've pet 1.2 million street cats.


Assassin's Creed Mirage is a stroll away from the massive open-world formula of recent titles like Valhalla and Odyssey. It's in a smaller space in Baghdad with a focus on the core stealth gameplay. Perhaps this approach appeals to lapsed fans of the series. It is also at a cheaper price point of $49.99.


"For the most part, Mirage achieves its goal of returning to its assassin ways," says our review. "But in some ways, it also shows me why Ubisoft made the decision to take the franchise in a new direction in the first place."

It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. "Lets you play your own Star Trek story" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, we told you that British developer Team17 may experience job losses following the CEO leaving the company. Sadly, it looks as though this may be the case after all, with the studio possibly losing a third of its staff.


That's according to a recent report from Eurogamer, which says that cuts to Team17 could see 91 positions being affected. Initially, it was thought that the QA department would be the main focus of the layoffs. However, it appears as though redundancies may be felt in the IT, HR, marketing, customer service, and usability departments.

Developers are said to have contacted Eurogamer with concerns that upcoming games published by Team17 may be in jeopardy. At the time of writing, the studio has not issued an official statement, nor publically given a reason behind the restructure.


A bad time to be part of a development team


This seems to be just one more example of a wider issue in the current gaming industry. Publishers and studios have been restructuring departments and teams, which has unfortunately led to staff members being let go.


Recently, it was reported that Naughty Dog had also been hit with layoffs, as had The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us studio Telltale Games. Epic Games has also cut 16% of its workforce recently, impacting around 830 employees in total.


It's not just game developers, either. Streaming service Twitch has also been experiencing layoffs, making it feel like anyone who works in gaming in any capacity isn't safe.


Hopefully, Team17 will issue a statement about the reported layoffs, but right now feels like a shaky time to be involved in the video game industry.

This tasty jam of an indie horror title has a lot of potential, appealing to those who like a bit of Japanese folklore to spread on their gaming toast like some sort of macabre marmalade (that is definitely not a thing).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[D3Publisher has announced that Earth Defense Force 6 is finally getting localized sometime in Spring 2024. It’s coming to PS5 and PC.


Released in Japan in mid-2022, a lot of fans have been wondering if D3 had any intention on bringing it to the West. The series has had some popularity over here since the surprising success of 2006’s Earth Defense Force 2017.

Earth Defense Force 6 is a direct sequel to 2017’s Earth Defense Force 5. 90% of the world’s population was wiped out in the previous invasion, and while the survivors are trying to pick up the pieces, the remaining invaders on the planet are making it difficult. As a result, rather than clean urban areas, you’ll be defending the ruins of civilization from giant bugs and such. Beyond that, it kind of looks like more of the same. You have the four classes – Ranger, Air Raider, Wing Diver, and Fencer – and you’re basically just tasked with killing a lot of kaiju.


My most memorable experience with the series was plucking it from a bargain bin in the early days of the Xbox 360 and playing through it with a close friend. It was jank bordering on kusoge. There was one amazing plasma weapon we got, and whenever I’d fire it, the resulting bright bloom would somehow cross over the split-screen barrier and temporarily blind my co-op partner. It was amazing. I’ve kept up with the series since then, but it really hasn’t changed all that much over the years. And that’s mostly okay. It can be hard to stay invested in more of the same, but the formula endures the test of time.


Earth Defense Force 6 will be coming West sometime in Spring 2024. It’s set to release on PS5 and PC.

From the metropolitan streets of New Atlantis to seeing planets from low orbit, Bethesda has given us an attractive-looking game. But it could always stand to look a little better.


A recent upload to Nexus Mods (as spotted by DSO Gaming) gives us a Starfield HD texture overhaul from user luxor8071. Upping the visuals to 2K or even 8K resolution, this mod replaces plenty of the vanilla textures with higher definition ones.

Currently, the pack gives a spit shine to places like Akila City, New Atlantis, the Milky Way, and some general assets and materials, such as concrete, glass, wood, and water. It's also an ongoing project, with more textures being added in the future.


You cannot stop the modders


Nobody was surprised to see mods for Starfield come out the woodwork. Even before the game released fully, the community was tinkering with Bethesda's new IP. It is the way of life, especially when it comes to PC gaming.


As for Starfield itself, things are going pretty well for not-Skyrim-but-also-not-Elder-Scrolls-6-either. Bethesda released a couple of small patches recently to keep things ticking over, with some larger updates coming soon.


Everyone's going to be wondering where Todd Howard and his team go from here. Obviously, there's the aforementioned TES6, plus Fallout 5. Sadly, these hotly anticipated follow-ups are still years away. For now, we're getting as much as we can out of Starfield. If nothing else, we can at least make it look a bit prettier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, I think of how crazy Sega's Dreamcast era was. It came out with a huge bang, then fizzled so hard that Sega got out of the console game completely. Given that I still play my Genesis/Mega Drive, Sega CD, and Dreamcast in my spare time, it's like it never died: but it did! That's why it's so amazing to me that the Sonic franchise has not only endured but is constantly debuting on a system run by its former competitor, Nintendo. All that to say: Sonic Superstars is the main eShop game coming out this week, and will be out on October 17.

Psyonix also explains that item lending was not a supported action, with all trades considered final.

The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a "surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape" in blissful Malibu.
There are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands. Here's a video of the opening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Princess Peach: Showtime! is slated to hit shelves on March 22, 2024, and as the release date crawls nearer, we're seeing increased marketing for the game. Twitter user @Nintendeal noted that Nintendo has surreptitiously swapped out the box art. This change can be seen on the eStore. 




The new art is almost entirely the same, save for a few extremely minor changes. Most notably, Princess Peach has been slightly edited to have more of a determined face, making her look like she's ready for battle. 


Kung-fu Peach in the background has also been given a fiercer face. Princess Peach isn't the first Nintendo character to get this treatment, as Reddit user /u/Stilgrave has noticed that Kirby gets an angrier face in his Western releases. 


Online, reception to the change has been mixed. Some people like the old face, describing it as friendlier. Others have taken a liking to the redesign which shows that Princess Peach isn't anyone to mess with. 


As trailers reveal, the game will have the princess putting on different outfits that grant her unique abilities. She'll be joined by Stella, who also looks prepared for battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords Of The Fallen is a reboot of CI Games and Deck 13's 2014 action-RPG called… Lords Of The Fallen. We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.
Raise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.

Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. 
Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC last week and both critics and fans alike are quite happy with the series return to its roots. Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft's biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. 
Thank you all for joining us on Basim's journey in 9th Century Baghdad!

October 11, 2023
Alongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: 
479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad
60 million Leaps of Faith
1.2 million street cats pet
"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception," Ubisoft's statement reads. "We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


We had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review. If you're still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage tips and tricks. Read our interview with Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub after that.

Having founded it in 2006 in Osaka, Japan, later working on games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101, he left his reason for leaving up in the air. He simply said, "This came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs" and that he feels "this outcome is for the best." Now, just a few weeks later, Kamiya has started a YouTube channel – aptly called "Hideki Kamiya Channel" – and in his first video, he reveals he's not retiring, as first reported by VideoGamesChronicle.

Great games are great no matter how much time has passed, and that remains true of Company of Heroes. The RTS classic that robbed us of our evenings and weekends back in 2006 has returned to the Nintendo Switch in the form of the Company of Heroes Collection and despite an updated control scheme for the console, after a few hours, it became like slipping on a comfortable, familiar pair of boots.
Right from the beginning, we were reminded that this isn’t Call of Duty or another series that glorifies or sanitises warfare. The first mission of the core game drops players directly into the Normandy Beach invasion and treats us to a cutscene where entire platoons of soldiers are mowed down by German machine-gun fire. It is brutal and depressing, as depictions of war should be, and does a good job of setting up the difficult, tactical gameplay that you'll be dropped into.

Back in the day, before Nintendo Direct became a thing, Nintendo was often known for its memorable appearances at events such as Space World and E3.
Some are well known for their meme potential ("My body is ready!") while others are famous for their sheer lunacy (hello Wii Music), but there are some that have become lost to the relentless passage of time that we believe shouldn't be forgotten. One such event is was E3 2000, during which Nintendo had promoted The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask for the N64.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.
But up front it tells you "There are no wrong choices, only your choices" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about "tracing different pathways" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.

Jusant gets a lot of things right. It sets a quiet, meditative atmosphere without boring you to sleep. The gameplay is also constantly engaging while not overwhelming you with stimuli.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. 
This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the "paragon of the future." The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a "deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces."


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive's scrapped version of Dead Island 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 
The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 


Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have "hundreds" of titles support this feature in the future. 
Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:
Japan – October 17
Europe – October 23
North America – October 30
As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming's mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you're a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming?

That seminal entry proved that Nintendo’s iconic plumber could transition to 3D and still be the juggernaut franchise it was in 2D. It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. 
In 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim. The visual improvements from the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube were apparent, and Super Mario Sunshine once again proved to be a hit with both fans and critics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever a friend asks for help in speccing out their upcoming PC build, I almost inevitably go to check if the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2 is in stock. Because, for lower-end and mid-range builds especially, do you truly need any other CPU cooler? The Hyper 212 Evo V2 near-perfectly  balances simplicity, effectiveness, and affordability; it’s like the PC component equivalent of Charles Eames’ museum-beloved leg splint, only less stackable. More to the point, it’s down to £33 in the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale, equalling its lowest price of 2023 thus far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ara: History Untold's headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the "father of wargaming", in the mid-1800s. 


"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies," says Menard. "And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. 


"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of usefulness to the average PC owner, sales events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days aren’t just for knocking hundreds off big-ticket hardware. They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. 


This has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.

Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang's current headcount and Microsoft's resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps? And now, those players are trying to shut the whole thing down.

In 2010, eight million French pirates used the protocol but in 2022 that figure was down to just two million, a government report concludes. The challenge ahead is to suppress pirate IPTV and streaming sites, the latter of which coincidentally hit the mainstream roughly 12 years ago.

Today though, this monitor crashes into new relevance as it's been discounted to just $200 at LG's US store, an incredible price that makes it almost an impulse buy pickup for anyone that wants to try out the majesty of an ultrawide monitor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you a Mac player who's been hungrily looking forward to the eventual Mac port of Counter-Strike 2, released last month, after sinking many hours and much pocket money into the preceding Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Fantastic news, it's been binned off! In the course of making what they're calling "the largest technical leap in CS history", Valve have decided to discontinue support for MacOS. They're also doing away with support for older PCs, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems - in future, the game will be exclusive to 64-bit Windows and Linux systems.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/10/sony-announces-new-slim-playstation-5-models-with-removable-disc-drives"/>
        <updated>2023-10-10T16:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models," the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. "There are four separate cover panels," it says, "with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte." This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed its "fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: 
An update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6
October 9, 2023
As you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. 
In the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  


Total War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup. However, a new tweet by Activision Blizzard makes it sound like the company's games won't hit the subscription service until next year. Plus, Activision Blizzard says it won't be adding the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV to Game Pass this year.
Here's what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's October, which means it's the month of Halloween. And Fortnite players know that this month is when developer Epic Games celebrates the season with Fortnitemares, a spooky-themed event that typically includes new weapons, quests, skins, and more. This year is no different as Fortnitemares 2023 runs from now until November 3 and brings with it Alan Wake, Michael Myers, Jack Skellington, a new shotgun, a new blade, a pumpkin launcher, a witch broom, and more. 
Everything In The Fortnitemares 2023 Event: 
New Fortnite Skins And Outfits
One of the most exciting aspects of a new Fortnitemares Halloween event is the addition of new skins and outfits into the battle royale. And for our money, this year's lineup is one of the best so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?


With the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a "mixed reality" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.

If you enjoy Slay The Spire and FTL, do have a look, though I might argue that FTL's follow-up, Into The Breach seems a stronger influence. Ah, play the demo and see for yourself!

The company expect to bring it home by 13th October.
Aside from hastening the arrival of a grim future that consists of a giant, mechanised Phil Spencer engaged in a trans-Pacific staring contest with Nintendo, this also means we can expect new and recent behemoths like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The June 2023 reveal of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself. Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Players won't need to wait long to play as Elephant Mario, as it appears in the very first stage, Welcome to the Flower Kingdom. The Elephant Fruit emerges out of a block, and true to the trailer, Mario transforms into this new for…]]></summary>

While Todd Howard said we’d be able to visit over 1,000 planets, the Bethesda dev actually undersold the sheer scale of Starfield’s galaxy - there are actually close to 1,700 planets, and now someone’s seen them all just weeks after launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy's comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game "built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance."
Puha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2's performance, but we'll get to that further down the page.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do love a game that tells you upfront what it's about while making nary a lick of sense, and visual novel Stop Burying Me Alive, Beautiful is certainly that. You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.
Click the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, "underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a "rat god".

The headsets have not been without their growing pains, but the path from Rift to Quest has been generally smooth, and the iterations have always added worthy improvements. Meta Quest 3 continues along that path to deliver what is, by a large margin, my favorite VR headset, but it doesn’t fix all the problems the medium continues to face.
Comfortability And Visuals
Wearing Meta Quest 3 is reasonably comfortable. The straps are easy to adjust and allow you to make the headset surprisingly tight against your face. This is good for blocking out light and mov…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.”


Ohlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,” he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to "overstaffing". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.


"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go," reads an official FAQ from the group. "This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis."

With Assassin's Creed Mirage on our minds, which is an overt throwback to the classic Assassin's Creed formula, we decided to take a look back at the first game in the blockbuster series. Some elements of the game hold up and others don't, but in any case, it's a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.
You can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin's Creed right here.

Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall. 
Publisher Bethesda's patch notes about today's Redfall update don't specify how exactly this Performance Mode works, but presumably, it runs the game at 60 FPS. This update also brings some heavily requested features to Arkane as well, including stealth takedowns, more accessibility options, multiplayer communication improvements,…]]></summary>

CD Projekt Red have expressed that they have “no regrets” about switching from a third-person camera to a first-person one in the transition from The Witcher to Cyberpunk, however, for future games in Night City, the studio are still undecided.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HyperX's Cloud Orbit S is a fascinating wireless gaming headset with planar magnetic drivers. Despite the name, this headset is produced by audio experts Audeze and the Cloud Orbit S is 99% the same as the Audeze Mobius, just with a slightly different colour scheme, simpler microphone and without Bluetooth support. That allows HP to hit a more aggressive price target, making the Cloud Orbit S one of the most affordable ways to try a great planar magnetic gaming headset. 
The Cloud Orbit S debuted at a mighty £299.99, but today it's available on Amazon for just £209 - a nice £91 savings.

        <updated>2023-10-06T16:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correction: In 2022 the Axis series switched from titling its games for their current year to titling them for next year. Since I skipped last year's installment, and searches for "Axis Football 2022" brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.
Axis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I've settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.
The result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4060 Ti has emerged as something of a sweet spot in Nvidia's current-gen graphics card lineup, being more affordable than the RTX 4070 and above while providing better performance per pound than the 4060 below it - despite some reservations over its 8GB VRAM capacity and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance uplift compared to the RTX 3060 Ti. However, if you want access to Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation and 3.5 ray reconstruction features, and one of the most power-efficient cards on the market, then the 4060 Ti is definitely worth a look. 
The RTX 4060 Ti normally retails for $400 or higher, but today you can pick up the Zotac Twin Edge OC model for just $370, a sweet $60 savings versus MSRP on one of the best-looking and highest-clocked 4060 Ti models.

A shooter set in their gunmetal grey sci-fi universe, Vanguard puts you into the shoes of mercenaries, dropping onto planets to retrieve equipment from wrecked ships, battling it out with AI-controlled pirates and other squads of human players. It’s Escape from Tarkov by way of the galaxy of New Eden.


If you’ve followed CCP, you may get a sense of de ja vu. This isn’t the first time the developers have tried to make a shooter happen in EVE Online: it’s the fourth. It’s just they've only gotten one out the door before.

Much in the same way that the James Bond series has a set structure and tropes, only I Expect You To Die's blueprint involves pastiche and puzzles rather than cars, gadgets, and variously objectified women.

So the news that CD Projekt Red have partnered with a production company to create a live action adaptation project set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077? I'm onboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pre-registrations have gone live for Konami's Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive drama for mobiles - I know, shush, I'm sure it'll come to PCs eventually - which follows a cast of characters around the world who are being tormented by monsters from the eponymous Town of Woe.
My enthusiasm for Silent Hill these days is approximately that of a dog returning to his vomit (or better, a depressive male protagonist with repressed memories that keep reeling him back to the same, misty high street). There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can't let go. And Ascension does sound quite intriguing, not least for being a crowd-sourced storytelling enterprise akin to a massively multiplayer Until Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 has been on the back-burner amid the chaos of Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield's launches, but much like an arch-demonness putting together the pieces of an inter-planar conspiracy, Blizzard have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. The action-RPG's next big round of additions, the Season of Blood, launches on 17th October alongside the Steam edition of the game. It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.


The new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dredge was a delightful indie surprise when it launched earlier this year, but if it left you wanting more spooky ship survival, you're in luck. The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include "1-3 hours of content" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game's publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project "in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team." That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is "set in the world" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.
For more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Electronic Wireless Show podcast returns to one of our recent previous messes to discuss Payday 3. More specifically, we look at the post-launch changes the devs are making in an effort to improve matchmaking and wait times. Specifically, we use this to think about games that have changed their reputations after a rocky start, what with Cyberpunk 2077's recent 2.0 update. What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man's Sky?
We've also been playing some big recent games, so tune in for discussions of Assassin's Creed Mirage, a call for pirate games, and a hilarious misunderstanding about Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.

They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That's a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Mirage is, so says the Alice B review, "the most enjoyable Assassin’s Creed game for years." That’s thanks in part to a returning focus on classic AC stealthing in a single, densely detailed city, and this back-to-basics approach extends to the technical side too. Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.
It also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.

The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, "bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee."

It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, "Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. 
Red Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4
October 4, 2023
Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very much like an assassin sliding a poison needle into your wrist while shaking your hand, Ubisoft have added Denuvo's anti-piracy/anti-cheating DRM software to Assassin's Creed: Mirage in the game's day-one update, aka patch 1.0.2. We've known for a while that the game would use Denuvo, together with the VMProtect software, but what's baking the noodles of many players is that the Denuvo functionality has been snuck in after the Assassin's Creed: Mirage review embargo, denying critics the chance to assess its impact on the game.

Adventure Mode, in case you've been living under a rock (which I guess you probably have, if you've been playing Dwarf Fortress), is the open world roguelike RPG element of the game, which lets you roam the enormous realm you've generated and even tour/loot/disturb the unquiet spirits of your own, abandoned fortress. Alas, there's no word on a release date for the Steam edition's Adventure Mode beyond "not this year".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Mirage during a special celebratory event for the franchise's 15th anniversary. After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. 
If you've kept up with Mirage, you know it's a bit of a return to the series' roots. After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow.…]]></summary>

As one of the most popular and influential series in video games, Super Mario Bros. must appeal to a wide audience of players across a massive spectrum of skills. The main stages of nearly every Super Mario Bros. game accomplish this daunting feat through balanced level design, innovative gimmicks, and fun challenges that nearly anyone can complete. However, late-game and special stages have traditionally been the place where Nintendo tests the mettle and skill of more veteran players.
Areas like Special Zone in Super Mario World and stages like Champion's Road in Super Mario 3D World are just a couple of examples of Nintendo flex…]]></summary>

We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it's official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 


If you don't want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that's available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal's brutal environment. 
"Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform," a press release reads. "Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.
"Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk."
The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15.

        <updated>2023-10-04T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, unveiled The Alters last year. It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. 
Today, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is "driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. 
Check it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: 


"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters'," a press release reads. "Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources." 
11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. 
"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves," the press release reads.

The Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. 
For more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Nintendo ended eShop functionality for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, marking the beginning of the end for these devices. Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. 
More specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. 
As of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.
https://t.co/nOyzBImHCE
October 4, 2023
"In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software," Nintendo's announcement reads. "This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution."
Nintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if "an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services" for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. 
The company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that "for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop." 
The fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
