        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mean, get it if you don't have it
Celeste quickly became one of the most relevant platformers in the past five years or so, and if you haven't partaken yet, now is the time. Both Celeste and TowerFall are on sale for five bucks on the Switch eShop.
The news comes via Extremely OK Games (the creators behind both titles), and the interesting part of the announcement is that in addition to North America, it's also on sale in Europe: including parts of Europe it's never been on sale before in the past.
While TowerFall is easily better with local players behind it, Celeste is a must-buy in any context. Seriously, if you even remotely enjoy platformers, just get it for that price. It'll last you through the weekend and then some, and odds are you'll be thinking about it long after that. And even if you don't normally like platformers or struggle with them, it has some extra options to tweak to make things a little more manageable.
You can find Celeste here on Switch, and TowerFall here. The Switch is a great platform for both! Portability suits Celeste as it has echoes of a Game Boy title, and TowerFall, with its party atmosphere, makes sense for a Nintendo console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sale runs until June 23
Dragon's Dogma is on sale right now, in part to celebrate the announcement of the sequel late last night in an errant Capcom stream.
So the general gist of the sale is a roughly 84% off discount on every platform but Switch, where it's 66% off. Here's the breakdown, with links:
PC/Steam - $4.79
Xbox (playable on Xbox One/Series X and S) - $4.49
PSN (playable on PS4 and PS5) - $4.79
Switch - $9.99
For under five bucks, Dragon's Dogma is definitely worth it. It's one of the wildest games of the last 10 years or so, offering up an epic adventure with all sorts of wonkiness to boot. That price will help the latter elements go down smoother, and given that it's not for everyone, even if you abandon it eventually you won't have spent too much on it.
In that sense, the sequel is a massive opportunity to correct the technical sins of its father. It took a long time, but Dragon's Dogma (partially through the Arisen release) garnered a lot of good will within the gaming community, as it was an honest effort at a unique open world experience, with a bit of flair. If they can shore things up with an updated RE Engine foundation, it could take off even more.

No video game character in the world is as cute as Kirby, right? Nothing is terrifying or evil about a pink blob that can suck up or eat anything, and nothing is unsettling about the lore of the games or the enemies or anything.
But hey, at least the Awoofies are cute. These adorable little puppies are found everywhere in Kirby and the Forgotten Land. They have chubby legs, little noses, and pointy ears. They're also incredibly fluffy — who would want to hurt them?? Well, us, the player, apparently.

You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer's Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

In 2021, Capcom released two exclusive charity skins for its formative fighter Street Fighter V — The skins, which were made available for franchise heroes Ryu and Chun-Li, were sold for $5.99 each, with Capcom promising to donate all proceeds of the sales to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF).
Yesterday, the publisher revealed that it had raised an impressive total of $75,000 USD for the Street Fighter V skins, money which Capcom states equates to around 1500 hours of research into the detection and curing of breast cancer, which remains one of the most predominant forms of the cellular disease, affecting millions of women across the globe each and every year.

Nintendo has given a little peek at a brand new map coming to Splatoon 3 when the game splats onto Switch later this year, and it's one that's hidden under the game's main hub, Splatsville.
This underground area is known as the Undertow Spillway, an abandoned area underneath the city that's recently been renovated into a place perfect for Turf Wars. While metallic and grey throughout, stickers, overgrowing wildlife, and white writing are dotted throughout the area. And any paint you throw at your rivals and the ground pops against the more muted tones.

Final Vendetta, from the UK’s Bitmap Bureau (Xeno Crisis) draws influence for its assault and battery from almost every scrolling beat-em-up ever made, cherry-picking the good stuff and reworking it into a whole new chapter of sidewalk vigilantism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mean, good songs are kind of the norm in this series
So far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is putting its best foot forward. We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called "A Life Sent On."
Shared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a "somber flute-based melody," which is played by "off-seers" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.
For now, I've listened to this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times now (even when writing this!) and it's giving me extremely good vibes for how the game will turn out. Aesthetically it seems to be nailing everything it needs to, as that's arguably been one of the stronger points of the series from the start: outdoing other similar games on the same hardware.
Hopefully we get even more quality of life upgrades and a killer story. There's a lot to improve upon in the second core game mechanically.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 24
Pokemon Snap 64 will make its debut on Nintendo Switch on June 24, Nintendo has announced. It'll join the newer 2021 iteration on the same platform.
Originally released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64, the picture-taking simulator became an instant cult classic. In a sense, it's the perfect game to come to a subscription service, as the concept is kind of out there, to the point where a lot of folks would never go out of their way to seek it out, but if a lot of those same people gave it a shot, they'd really enjoy it.
The Nintendo 64 side of things has been particularly slow-going, as far as the expansion pack is concerned. So originally Nintendo launched the service back in October with nine games. Since then they've doled out an additional game per month, including Paper Mario, Banjo Kazooie, Majora's Mask, F-Zero X, Mario Golf, Kirby 64, and now Pokemon Snap 64. That's a grand total of 16 games. The Genesis side has fared a little better, as Nintendo generally drops three or more games at once on that expansion pack line, albeit at a less regular cadence.
Switch Online is kind of all over the place in terms of value. Hopefully it'll improve at some point as early as this year.

We're not saying Link should be a bit of a better swimmer after appearing in so many games, but given the scope of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's world — and its beauty — we're a little bit sad we can't do a bit more exploring in the depths of the lakes and oceans.
Well, that's if you limit yourself to the game's actual mechanics. Breath of the Wild has seen numerous tricks, glitches, and exploits uncovered over the years, and YouTube channel Gaming Reinvented has once again come up with the goods, sharing a method that will let you sink right to the bottom of the ocean floor (or the lakebed) to take a little look and the hidden secrets underwater.

Overwatch 2 finally secured a release date earlier this week and official confirmation that the sequel to Blizzard's hugely popular online shooter will be coming to Switch. Now Blizzard has revealed the game's upcoming roadmap, along with some interesting changes, during a reveal event broadcast yesterday.
On top of the news that Overwatch 2 will be going free-to-play for its PvP mode, Blizzard has now revealed that the sequel will no longer be using Loot Boxes, and will be replacing this with a Battle Pass and an in-game shop to ensure fans can choose from what's on offer rather than rely on chance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that "an objective review" from external advisors "determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence "suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board."
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that "there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units" in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, "based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard."

While Matano has confirmed that the game will have 50 characters, with 44 announced and a further six to be revealed, and there will be six different modes to play at launch — All-Star Battle, Arcade, Versus, Online, Practice and Customize — he also revealed that the game will not be using rollback netcode.

First up, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade leaves Epic exclusivity to steer its motorbike onto Steam today. Steam Deck compatibility was touted too, you lucky beggars.


Then, after much faffing with mobile games and memorabilia, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed footage from the second part of Remake, now known as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Kitase also confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga might actually be completed in our lifetimes, thanks to Square Enix deciding to draw it to a close with a third, as yet untitled part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a full remaster of the PSP exclusive
Square Enix is remastering Crisis Core, and it's arriving pretty soon. Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a remaster of the 2007 prequel to Final Fantasy VII, and it's coming to PC and consoles this winter.
The news was announced during today's Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration showcase. The original Crisis Core is a prequel story to Final Fantasy VII proper, following Zack Fair's mission to find missing SOLDIER Genesis Rhapsodos. This new version looks to follow the same story, but with an updated look and feel.
Square Enix is calling it a full remaster. Reunion will have HD graphics and all 3D models refreshed. Dialogue will be fully voice-acted, and there's a new soundtrack arrangement as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRBiRFM2k0I
Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion is planned to launch on both PC and modern consoles. That means PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. No news on a firm date just yet.
All's Fair in love and remasters
According to Square Enix, you won't need to have played Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VII Remake in order to play Crisis Core Reunion. It also works as a standalone story, with its own adventure that unfolds.
That said, the expanded universe stuff is really all about seeing it all come together. And considering how Zack seems to be playing a big part in the also-announced Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, this might be a good bit of homework to do before next winter.

The big question is, obviously, will any of the story content change? Zack Fair's status in the Remake continuum is clearly quite different from the original. Remake also seems to be linked to the original series, in a very Rebuild of Evangelion manner. Things are about to get wacky and wild with the timeline and deeper lore questions. Hopefully we get some answers this winter.

How fun!

      <p>Square Enix not only revealed Final Fantasy VII’s second game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/16/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-remakes-second-chapter-arrives-next-winter" target="_blank">Rebirth</a>, during today's 25th Anniversary presentation.&nbsp;It also answered a question fans have asked since this whole thing started: how many games does the saga consist of?</p>

<p>It turns out the answer is three. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that there’s only one untitled game left after Rebirth launches next year. Following a three-game roadmap is fitting given that the original Final Fantasy VII consisted of three discs on PS1. Kitase, unsurprisingly, did not give a window for when the final game will arrive.</p>

Today, we got our first look at the next entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second of three planned entires, Square Enix confirmed today, and will arrive next winter for PS5.
The trailer closed out today's Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration.  In it, we see Cloud walking around in an open area, soon joined by Sephiroth. The pair walk around a massive area, as questions circle around.

Cut-in text asks what will happen to the planet, and what Sephiroth's endgame is. At one point, someone asks if she's some kind of impostor. Then we see Zack and Cloud, walking towards Midgar, same as they were in the ending of Final Fantasy VII Remake.

      <p>At long last, the second chapter of Final Fantasy VII Remake was revealed during today’s 25th anniversary stream. It’s called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it launches next winter, or towards the end of 2023,&nbsp;for PlayStation 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cinematic trailer provided tantalizing glimpses of what’s to come, most notably gameplay of Cloud and Sephiroth exploring a section of the world together. While that may very well be a flashback, those who played Remake know that anything is possible at this point. Today's video also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second entry in what&nbsp;will be a three-game series.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Sorry to have kept you waiting"
During the Dragon's Dogma 10th anniversary stream, Capcom kept us waiting, but finally confirmed what we've all been waiting for: a sequel is happening! Dragon's Dogma II is real.
Game director Hideaki Itsuno spoke about his origins with RPGs and the development process for the still-unique-to-this-day Dragon's Dogma before showing his new t-shirt and confirming that, yes, Dragon's Dogma II is "currently in development."
Here's... the sequel's logo:

To be clear, no gameplay footage — not even a snippet — was shown. No window, either.
According to Itsuno, "everyone in the development team is hard at work creating a game that we hope you will enjoy." He closed the stream with a classic "please look forward to it," and that was it. After much speculation, I'm just glad it's now out in the open.
Dragon's Dogma is something of a flawed (and charmingly funny) gem, and while we did eventually get Dark Arisen, the time is right for a firing-on-all-cylinders sequel. The series has picked up fans over the years — it even got a Netflix anime adaptation — and it's clear that Itsuno is passionate about returning to high-fantasy role-playing action.

Imagine your Pawns in the RE Engine
After the stream, Capcom confirmed that Dragon's Dogma II will use the RE Engine.
Not that many games could get my imagination this fired up with just a logo announcement, but then again, Dragon's Dogma isn't most games. While details are basically non-existent at this point, it's easy to imagine how cool some of these creatures will look in a modern engine and how ridiculous our friendly neighborhood Pawns will be.
Coming off of Elden Ring, I'm so ready to see what Capcom can deliver.

Final Fantasy VII is considered one of the best games of all time, and as we celebrate its 25th anniversary, this game is the gift that keeps on giving. An enhanced and expanded version of the remake, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, is already available on the PS5 and the Epic Games Store. We learned today during the Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration stream that the Intergrade version is also going to be on Steam as of June 17, and the game will be playable on the Steam Deck as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4t1OFONu10
Intergrade comes bundled with INTERmission, which is new story content for the game featuring Yuffie as the main character. There are other new gameplay and content features, including Fort Condor, as part of the game as well.
Similar to the PC launch of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on the Epic Games Store, the Steam version costs $69.99 — but there's a discount knocking it down to $49.69 until July 7.

June isn't done yet, and this afternoon, we've got another gaming showcase to watch. It's about time to check out the Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration, which will be streaming live at 3:00 p.m. Pacific today. What's on the docket? Officially, Square Enix has promised "all the latest information relating to the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII."
Depending on who you ask (and which leaks you believe), this stream could touch on many different things — a Steam release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, a coveted glimpse of FFVII Remake Part 2, and potentially even some FFVII "expanded universe" news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wohQiEysqIA
You can watch the event live on YouTube and Twitch.
While the FFVII 25th Anniversary Celebration stream is supposed to be on the shorter side, the hype for this event has really snowballed in the past 24 hours, as is the way.
Admittedly, I'm less interested in hearing about stuff like The First Soldier and Ever Crisis, and with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 such an unknown quantity at this point, I'm sure many of you feel the same way. If we get anything concrete on the Naoki Hamaguchi-directed game, and maybe a fun wild-card announcement, I'll be happy. A few details — heck, even a bit of familiar imagery to latch onto — can go a long way while we wait.
(Worth reminding: if Dragon's Dogma is more your speed, Capcom is also hosting a 10th anniversary stream at the exact same time. I'm feeling reserved yet hopeful.)
Y'all ready for this?
Recap — that was a great showing!
Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is available on Steam tomorrow
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the next of the remakes, coming next winter
Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is getting a closed beta sometime this year
Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion arrives this winter for PC, consoles
It's nice to still feel a bit of that "E3" spark.

Neon White went live today, on Nintendo Switch and PC, for anime speedrunning freaks everywhere. But even if you're not into going fast in an anime world, you should also take some time to check out the Neon White OSTs from Machine Girl that hit Bandcamp today.
Artist Machine Girl composed not one, but two OSTs—or original soundtracks—for Neon White. They're the tunes that play in the background as you speed along, zipping from demon to demon and blazing through the outer limits of heaven. They're extremely good.
Check out this track, dubbed The Wicked Heart, from the first OST. It starts out at full throttle, with punchy drums and raw noise bleeding throughout the track. The melody drops in around the 1:13 mark and is one of my favorites in Neon White.
Neon White OST 1 - The Wicked Heart by Machine Girl
Neon White and catch some relaxed, easygoing beats. It's perfect for kicking back after a long day of setting records.
Neon White OST 2 - The Burn That Cures by Machine Girl
Tracks like Bloody Sneakers, the theme for Neon Violet, almost remind me of early PlayStation days. I think of the Racing Lagoon soundtrack, and in the best way possible.
Neon White OST 2 - The Burn That Cures by Machine Girl
Beats to blast your record in half
What I'm saying is, the Neon White OSTs are a jam. It's already a contender for best soundtrack of the year, in my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0b-qZTF0Mc
As for Neon White itself, it's great. I've spent the last week setting and then besting my times, competing with other early players along the way. It's anime as heck, like the sort of series you'd find on a VHS tape in the '90s at your local mom-and-pop rental place. Suffice to say, if you like going fast, Neon White is worth your time—and it's got some killer beats, too.

If you ask me, not enough creators are playing in the WarioWare-esque microgame space. We got a new game last year on Nintendo Switch, sure, but a big part of the fun is that initial discovery phase before you've got every zany "think fast!" task figured out. With that in mind, I may not be super into Atari, but the idea behind Atari Mania sounds great.
Atari Mania has 150+ microgames built on the brand's legacy, from Pong to Adventure to Yars' Revenge. The team says that we'll "never think of Bentley Bear the same way again."

In the game, you'll play as the Atari Vault caretaker, so there's a wider story element to bind the '70s- and '80s-inspired microgames together. There are "dead pixels" to stop.
As for the gameplay structure, it'll be a gauntlet of escalating microgames in a random order, culminating in boss battles. So you'll need to be quick and consistent to survive.
Beyond today's trailer, Atari Mania developer iLLOGIKA also confirmed collectibles like "vintage Atari art, posters, manuals, and fun facts," along with "fully playable versions of remastered Atari classics" that can be unlocked via challenges.
[caption id="attachment_330595" align="alignnone" width="1920"] One of many microgames. Note the timer bar at the bottom.[/caption]
For me, it's mostly going to come down to the individual microgames more than anything else — are they fun? Surprising? How deep are these cuts? That said, it's good to hear that there's more substance with collectibles, and the price seems reasonable enough.
Atari Mania will launch on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Atari VCS this summer for $19.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iOSterra
Square Enix has opened pre-registration for western players interested in its upcoming mobile RPG Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent. Interested parties can sign up for the new release ahead of its launch on iOS and Android platforms this summer.
Set once again in the lavish lands of Orsterra, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent will feature the fantasy RPG action and deep storytelling lore of the original 2018 adventure, stylized with that "retro 2D sprites on 3D rendered backgrounds" aesthetic that all of these mobile spin-offs tend to rock. Choose a party of "Chosen Ones" from the 64 available characters, before embarking upon a branching narrative packed with exploration, adventure, and oodles of juicy monster battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKYvONIJ3tE
"A few years prior to the events of Octopath Traveler, Orsterra is ruled by tyrants hungry for “wealth, power, and fame," reads an official blurb. "While the tyrants’ desires have unleashed a bottomless darkness upon the world… there are those who resist the darkness. You will meet them while traveling the world as “the Chosen Ones” of a divine ring. What will you obtain, and what will you experience through this journey? Soon the story will lead you to the tyrants of the land."
Champions of the Continent sports the stunning art style of its predecessor and features familiar and original tunes from series composer Yasunori Nishiki. Very unlike the original release, however, the mobile edition of Octopath Traveler is a free-to-play title that also features a variety of in-app purchases. I'm sure that you'd already put this together, but it's still worth clarifying.
Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent will launch on iOS and Android platforms this summer.

The indie gaming side of Xbox is hosting another demo event this year, the ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo event. Starting on June 21, the ID@Xbox team says it will have over 30 demos of upcoming games playable on Xbox.
These demos will be up from June 21 through the 27th, so be sure to check them out while the window's open. And ID@Xbox notes that these demos are not the average demos you'd usually see on stores. While those usually come from fairly completed games, the ones in ID@Xbox are more akin to "show floor demos" you might catch at PAX or something. Basically, these are early-stage projects, so be constructive if things seem a little rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBskR9Pcv7o
The full list of demos is arriving closer to June 21, but ID@Xbox showed four of them today. These include:
Batora: Lost Haven: An isometric action game where you journey through colorful planets and fight to save Earth using your physical and mental superpowers.
Broken Pieces: A time-based thriller that seems ideal for Control fans, where you have to solve the mystery of this bizarre French village.
Severed Steel: One for the blood-pumping FPS fans, it's got bullet-time and destructible environments.
Tinykin: A Pikmin-style game that we've had our eye on for a while, with an incredible look and tons of little helpers.
Dozens of demos galore
It's already been a pretty good summer for demos. The Steam Next Fest is on right now, and there are a ton of upcoming projects to discover and add to your wishlist there.
Last year's ID@Xbox demo event had some pretty great hands-on previews in the lineup too. Games like Tunic, Lake, Sable, and more were all part of the 2021 demo fest. It'll be exciting to see what pops up in this year's event.

Chocks away, my furry friends, AkSys Games has released its cute, anthropomorphic shmup Horgihugh and Friends on Switch, bringing its challenging but totes-adorbs sky fighting action to the Nintendo platform. It is available to download from the eShop today, priced at around $30.
You can check out a trailer for the fun-looking arcade blaster below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbFFTZ706ew
In the aftermath of a brutal world war, a fantastical, furry take on the planet has fully disarmed itself of all weapons in order to prevent such an atrocity from taking place again. Unfortunately, the skies are now under siege from an invading intergalactic force, The Gozareans, and with nowhere else left to turn, it is up to a party of retired pilots to take to the air in their vintage battle planes, squaring up against the invaders despite being both outmanned and severely outgunned.
Horgihugh and Friends boasts cheerful, cartoonish artwork by industry veteran Kou (Shantae, Mega Man X2) and a rousing soundtrack composed by Motoaki Furukawa (Metal Gear, Policenauts). As animalkind's last hope, players will blast their way through six stages of pew-pew action, gathering power-ups, swiftly dodging a skyful of projectiles, and taking on a seemingly endless army of drones, captained by no less than 13 unique boss characters.
I'd been hoping to get to this release for review, but the relentlessness of the Not-E3 news season has unfortunately prevented me from doing so. Nevertheless, I'll be sure to check it out. Chocks Away!

It's quite the task to localise a game. It's even more of a task to localise a narrative game. But a game like Disco Elysium, which contains around 1.2 million words, many of them complex political, psychological, and fictional concepts, it's probably near-impossible.
Nevertheless, it has been done. Developer ZA/UM has announced that the Japanese version of Disco Elysium: The Final Cut will be heading to PC, PlayStation, and Steam simultaneously on the 25th August, 2022.

      <p>Grab a pizza slice, kick back, and watch us take on the Foot Clan in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge! Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of <em>Game Informer</em> editors will tackle the game live on <strong>Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.</strong></p>

<p>Shredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge/old-school-thrills-new-school-polish" target="_blank">here</a>, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”</p>

First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All's well that ends well, though. In response to "overwhelming community response", Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

Coming off of Overwatch 1, the team's main goal is to try and deliver content on a "frequent and consistent basis," according to game director Aaron Keller.

Mario Strikers: Battle League is the first entry in Next Level Games' Mario Strikers series for a long time, and while it's a familiar (and excellent) romp, this new match brings a few new tricks up its sleeves — we mean, football socks.
Battle League introduces Gear which you can unlock and buy in the in-game store. But being a Mario game, you'll need to collect some of those lovely gold coins to get ahold of the goods. It's a lofty task, but with perseverance and patience, you'll be able to build up a big pile o' money that even Wario would be jealous of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stuffed Crust
Today sees the launch of nostalgic smack-'em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, (you can check out our review right here), but while the Heroes in a Half-Shell have only just returned to the streets, fans are already poking the developer squad on the possibility of post-release DLC.
In an interview with Xbox Expansion Pass, Tribute Games' Yannick Belzil was asked about the possibility of alternate character skins, for example, the turtles' penchant for trilbies and overcoats. In a response that makes perfect sense, Belzil noted that the distinct animated style of Shredder's Revenge prevents the team from altering the sprites too much, and thus alternate costumes are unlikely to be on deck, now or at anytime in the future.
https://youtu.be/GemOAwU-9fo
However, following some misleading "No DLC at all"-style headlines, Dotemu's Cyrille Imbert took to Twitter to clarify that while there are currently no plans for post-launch content, factors such as public perception and player feedback could decide whether the team returns to Shredder's Revenge at some point in the future. I'm sure, right now, they'd just like to rest up after a job well done.
Put simply: There are no DLC plans now. There could be in the future.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is a solid and fun brawler, but there is room, should Dotemu decide, for additional modes — such as Time Attack, Boss Rush, Endless, or 1CC. The TMNT lore runs deep, so should Tribute Games choose to add extra stages and/or characters, it would be understandably welcomed by fans. But all of this is putting the cart well before the horse. The game isn't even a single day old yet. But for those players who prefer the chase to the catch (seemingly all modern video game fans), know that future content ideas haven't been flushed down the sewer just yet.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge launches today on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I've had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I've stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

It's a fun week on Nintendo Switch, as several bigger games are coming out day and date with other platforms. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is arguably the biggest one, followed by Neon White. Fall Guys is also going free-to-play on June 21 on Switch, and Omori is out too on June 17.
As a result, there's not a ton coming out, but that's for the best! It's been a generally exhausting week, and Turtles plus Neon White should last people a while, and serve completely different audiences. Plus you can share in the experience of booting up Fall Guys for a few days and then putting it on ice for a while.

Sometimes, the heart and the head force two and two together and still somehow come up with five. Despite the eager finger-crossing of fans, Capcom has confirmed that its upcoming prehistoric sci-fi shooter Exoprimal is not connected to the universe of missing-in-action horror franchise Dino Crisis.
Game director Takuro Hiraoka finally put the kibosh on the rumor in a recent interview with IGN, referring to Exoprimal scientifically as "its own unique thing." Explaining further, it seems that the design team went with the reptilian overlords simply because they wanted the player to take on a foe that could truly be considered mankind's most ruthless, dangerous, and towering predator to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope it stays interesting that whole time
The jury is still out on Sonic Frontiers, as an array of takes are swirling from folks who have played it. For now, we can look at some facts. The Sonic Frontiers length is looking like "20-30 hours" according to director Morio Kishimoto (who spoke to IGN).
Naturally, that length is variable. Kishimoto also claims that it'll take "double" that length to clear everything and go for 100%, and a "character progression" system (which involves a skill tree and leveling) is supposed to keep people playing through that journey. For reference, Sonic Forces (the last mainline 3D Sonic) is roughly four hours long, and it takes around 20-ish hours to fully 100% it. 3D Sonic games typically range from five to 10 hours depending on the entry, so "20-30" is a massive shift, due in part to the "open world" focus.
It's really easy to be skeptical of how this will turn out. Shifts to massive open worlds don't always work out, as "character progression" alone might not be enough to propel players through a 100% completion, much less one campaign clear. The entire world needs to be interesting as well, and offer unique sidequests as well as a general sense of wonder and firm level design to ground the exploration.
Based on what we've seen, it's iffy whether or not that'll end up being the case. More so than anything, the open world design is the most make-or-break thing for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We salute the Queen
Following on from its official reveal at last week's Summer Game Fest showcase, Naughty Dog has begun slowly drip-feeding new details and clips pulled from its upcoming remake The Last of Us Part I — yesterday, the studio shared footage of one of its redesigned character models, Tess.
The incredibly brief clip, posted to the official Twitter, features a side-by-side comparison of the hardened smuggler as she appears in both the original release of The Last of Us and the new remake. While the animation frames are clearly 1:1, the character model is, frankly, stunning. Tess looks far more her requisite years, with visual weathering yet steely reserve deserved of a woman who has fought, killed, and seen more than enough of her fair share of death during her time in the Boston zone.
https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1536854906056822785?s=20&t=TEyaELJ2-xWwocFh1_74mw
To be clear, I think that the original iteration of Naughty Dog's magnum opus is still a fantastic-looking title, but there's no denying the amazing upgrade on display in this brief clip. Responding to the fans who treated the reveal with positivity, the developer would confidently assure them that they "ain't seen nothing yet." Does a Last of Us remake even need to exist? I'm not sure it does, personally, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate when fine work has been done in the talented sphere of game development.
The Last of Us Part I is currently in development for PS5. It is scheduled to release this fall.

Social elements (group drinking), survival moments (evading orcs that are still skulking about the halls), crafting, and building seem to be in play. Development is handled by Free Range Games, who has worked as an external developer on several titles, and handled primary development for Spelldrifter.

It seems that Capcom can't stop showing us Street Fighter 6. The studio has been feeding the community a steady stream of tidbits ever since its official gameplay reveal during last week's Sony State of Play presentation. With the spirit of a parent holding their newborn baby, Capcom has excitedly rolled out character reveals, music videos, test sessions, and a wide variety of minor details and elements.
Despite blatantly stating this past weekend that the developer would be going "dark" on the title, Capcom simply cannot help itself, offering up new clips and information pertaining to everyone's favorite Family Man, Guile — first revealed during Thursday's Summer Game Fest. We were treated to the news that Guile's iconic Sonic Boom now features a "perf…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinifactory developers Zachtronics have revealed what they say is their last game, Last Call BBS. It’s a compilation of eight smaller games, some new and some reworked elements of previous games. These range from assembling Gundam-esque models to the tile-matching from Exapunks, now with an added single–player campaign. Of course, there’s two solitaire games thrown in for good measure too. Check out Zachtronics’ last hurrah in the trailer below.

It was amazing when I played its early build last year, and its Steam Next Fest demo is somehow even better. How could it not be! Have you seen it?

It’s a combination of town management and survival sim, putting you in the presumably cheap clogs of a band of settlers trying to make a go of it in the wilderness. A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.

Resident Evil fans have a reason to revisit some of the series' recent hits this week as Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil 7 all got PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions (and forced PC updates). Owners of these games on PS4 and Xbox One can upgrade for free with benefits like faster load times, ray tracing, and even haptic feedback with DualSense controllers. Except, there's an unfortunate catch — if you own Resident Evil 7 through the PlayStation Plus Collection, you aren't getting the PS5 upgrade, which is the same sort of weird caveat Final Fantasy fans went through with Final Fantasy VII Remake.
Some of you pointed out this issue earlier this week, and sure enough, it's a bummer.

I got to play a short demo as part of the Tribeca Games selection this year. It was just one chapter, a short cooking session bookended by narrative sections that set up the recipe creation. Venba follows Venba herself, who's immigrated from India to Canada along with her husband.

A well-considered and highly logical decision handed down by a judge in Canada's Federal Court this week will also be of interest to those facing Voltage lawsuits elsewhere, the UK in particular.

It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn't know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting's first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support. Not bad at all!

The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you're willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That's a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

So it is with Outpost, a first-person base-builder with seemingly massive swarms that impressed during the Future Games Show. How does it look in the 8 minutes of playtest footage below? Less impressive - but still compelling.

      <p>GSC Game World has confirmed that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will now arrive in 2023. To hold fans over, the team released a new cinematic during today's Xbox Games Extended Showcase.</p>

<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/03/gsc-game-world-puts-stalker-2-development-on-sidelines-amidst-ongoing-ukraine-conflict">put on hold</a> when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game's development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's gloomy atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, a&nbsp;developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia's invasion and how it banded together amidst days of&nbsp;bombings&nbsp;<strong>(contains disturbing imagry&nbsp;of the war so viewer discretion is advised).</strong></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a "farmadventure", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a "survival game without survival"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare's acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. <em>GoldenEra</em>, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the&nbsp;influential FPS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer, uploaded on <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/goldenera-goldeneye-documentary-official-trailer?utm_source=twitter" target="_blank"><em>IGN</em></a>, features&nbsp;snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2022/06/08/rally-the-troops" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>GoldenEra</em> will be available digitally this month on June 27.</p>

There was no word on whether either game would make their way to Steam like Persona 4 Golden, though. Well, never fear, because developers Atlus say both games will be coming to Valve’s storefront, as Eurogamer report. In case you missed the trailer, here it is below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the official way to win 20 Minutes Till Dawn is to survive 20 minutes of monster attacks, I disagree. Like in Vampire Survivors, I think the roguelikelike arcade shooter's real victory condition is spewing so many bullets and explosions and fireballs and lightning strikes and ice shards that the framerate starts chugging. As far as I'm concerned, when the game can no longer process just how ridiculous my run is, I've beaten it and I win. Reader dear, I'm delighted to say I finally managed that in 20 Minutes Till Dawn. I finally won.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first piece of DLC for Resident Evil Village will release on October 28th, Capcom has announced. Revealed as part of their not E3 livestream, the Winter's Expansion will include three seperate additions to entice fans back into its world of tall vampire ladies and weird dog men.
The first is Shadow Of Rose, a story expansion set after the events of the base game that focuses on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters. In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious "powers", Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village. Players will guide Rose through a number of spooky locales, including what appears to be Castle Dimetrescu from the game's main campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Capcom announced Exoprimal, an action game devised by your six-year-old self where players jump into badass exosuit and then machine-gun roiling hordes of dinosaurs, Alice0 believed that you fought the big lizard-birds with the help of an AI. In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight's Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

      <p>Monster Hunter Rise kicked off the Capcom Showcase today, with new locations for hunters to explore on full display, along with plenty more monsters to take the fight to when the expansion releases. A demo will also be available starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>First off is the return of the Jungle area from the second generation of Monster Hunter, which has been completely redone for Sunbreak. While the Jungle sounds like it would be strictly filled with trees and other foliage, it's situated on the coast and offers plenty of sandy beaches and ruins to …]]></summary>

      <p>Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.</p>

<p>Exoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of …]]></summary>

Normally getting a good AiO of this size costs around £100 to £180, but right now Amazon is offering the MSI MAG CoreLiquid 280R for half price: just £50. That's an awesome value for a high-performance CPU cooler that even includes RGB lighting.

High praise indeed, and it was enough to earn a coveted RPS recommendation - even at its original price. Now you can pick up this delightfully clicky keyboard with low profile mechanical switches, a full-size UK layout and a beautiful metal build for £50 less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abib the troubadour killed an ancient evil spirit by throwing his knife at it. Tinyfolks is not a "story generator" sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.


There's no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn't matter that you're a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you'll have a great time doing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Next Fest has launched with, among 1000-plus indie demos, a playable slice of SCP: Secret Files. It’s the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it’s also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is the next big new game from Bethesda Game Studios, and it's a pretty big deal because they haven't made something that isn't a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game in like... ever. So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

Nivalis is a slice-of-life sim set in the same cyberpunk city as hovercar courier game Cloudpunk, where we'll get to run bars and restaurants, grow ingredients, fish, make friends, and maybe even find love. So like a cyberpunk Stardew Valley? Have a look in the new trailer.

Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a lot going on in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Paradox's grand strategy game Victoria III aims to simulate pretty much all of it, starting in 1836 and giving you a century to play with. A big selling point is that every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, from lowly farmer to high rolling capitalist, each having preferences and beliefs. Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.

But that's the future. Right now, the game has received a taste of far future with the release of Halo Infinite's Pelican aircraft as a real plane you can really fly in Flight Sim.

The rule for this showcase, as outlined early on, is that every game shown will launch within the next 12 months.

With Starfield, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Diablo IV, and much more shown at the event, there’s plenty to cover. Let's get started then, shall we?

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/pc-gaming-show/2022/06/12/rotwood-is-the-newest-game-from-klei-entertainment"/>
        <updated>2022-06-12T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/12/6c0ce632/rotwood.png" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /></p>


      <p>An unexpected and fun surprise from the PC Gaming Show was the reveal of Klei Entertainment's newest game. Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6307665535112"></iframe>

<p>Thanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a&nbsp;dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and&nbsp;fortified as well.</p>

<p>In typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is&nbsp;pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're&nbsp;controlling a cartoon character;&nbsp;Rotwood's&nbsp;models&nbsp;are expressive,&nbsp;fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays&nbsp;like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.</p>

<p>The trailer gave an early access date of "202?" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted&nbsp;on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning&nbsp;for release on any additional platforms at this time.</p>]]></summary>

I know it doesn't give anyone that title, but I figured whoever was hosting the game just kind of was it. But it turns out I am a FOOL and that nobody was a captain at all. All that is going to change when Season Seven of the MMO pirate 'em up arrives next month, as confirmed in a jaunty song at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase. Players are getting a whole raft of "Captaincy features" - and these include being able to name your ship and customise the interior.

      <p>After a long absence, Nightdive Studio's remake of System Shock made an appearance at the PC Gaming Show, and it's looking pretty cool. You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary&nbsp;Warren Spector.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06lOzXU1F_M" width=""></iframe>

<p>This new trailer for&nbsp;System Shock gives a great look at the game's visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game.&nbsp;More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors&nbsp;are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock,&nbsp;is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.</p>

<p>System Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, is making something new and a bit more surreal. The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/12/5e816fe8/the_invincible.png" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /></p>


      <p>The PC Gaming Show debuted an extended look at gameplay for a Sci-fi thriller from Starward Industries, The Invincible. What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13nRHDoUz6s" width=""></iframe>

<p>The demo begins&nbsp;from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local.&nbsp;She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a&nbsp;task it's been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to&nbsp;discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then,&nbsp;the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.</p>

<p>I'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023&nbsp;on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>]]></summary>

In a gameplay trailer shown at the Xthesda showcase tonight we saw that Amicia is struggling with whether or not she should kill the heck out of soldiers, or try to stealth on by.

But at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase tonight they were able to share that Diablo 4 is coming out next year for some much anticipated ARPG antics. Why, that's the Diablo game people keep saying they want!
Plus, the Necromancer is confirmed as the fifth playable class. There's a moody trailer that tries to make being a Necromancer sound twisted and dangerous and a hard path to walk, but it mostly makes it sound like Necromancers are cool badasses with loads of skeleton best friends.

      <p>Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind 2019’s The Outer Worlds, has revealed Pentiment, a beautiful narrative journey through 16th Century Bavaria. It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revealed during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating.&nbsp;The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This …]]></summary>

      <p>As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama where you make choices that impact the characters' lives, made an appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer, which was captured in-game,&nbsp;not only looked intriguing but also&nbsp;revealed the game's launch date. And it's next month!</p>

<p>On July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of "betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience." The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you'll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, "Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing." The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.</p>

<p>The multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it's unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guess we'll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.</p>]]></summary>

Judging by the big guns and big abilities you have at your disposal, they have - and the vampires should be watching their be-caped backs. Never thought I'd see the day when someone made being a vampire hunter look cooler than being a vamp, but we might be getting there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not-E3 2022 continues today with the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, and we’ll be liveblogging it right here. Will we see more of Starfield that isn’t CGI target footage and concept art? Could we get a closer look at Playground Games’ mysterious new Fable? Will Redfall get its first major public appearance since, uh, the last the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase? Dunno, but you can watch the whole show via the stream embedded below, and follow along with commentary from myself and vid bud Liam. The curtain raises at 6pm BST / 7pm CEST / 1pm ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Passed almost a quarter of a century ago, the DMCA prevents citizens from repairing many of their own electronic devices. The proposed Freedom to Repair Act 2022 seeks to fix this problem by allowing circumvention in strictly limited circumstances. This week the proposal was labeled "pro-piracy legislation" but is that a fair assessment or an expected overreaction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trailer for Morbid Metal from tonight's Future Games Show had a lot of metal (the music genre) and metal (the stuff you make blades out of). Morbid Metal is a hack 'n' slash, but the difference here is that you have four different mech lads at your disposal, and you can morph between them whenever you like. This real-time switching means Morbid Metal moves very quickly. You might think hyphenated phrases like "high-octane", "action-packed", and "fast-paced" are moving in the direction of this game, but buddy this is going at such speed that they're already here.

The developers say they need more time to make the engine trails glow just right, and to make the derelict megastructures mega enough. We will apparently see more of the game in action this August, though.

I mentioned Planet Of Lana earlier this week in my Day Of The Devs 2022 round-up, because it featured in that indie showcase too. Check out the trailer if you missed it on Thursday, it’s quite charming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year a couple of brothers posted a concept trailer for an FPS horror game that didn't exist (named Project Ill). Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I've not got much to point you towards - there's no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

If you've seen Palworld's previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show. For the uninitiated: Palworld is a game in which you can catch off-brand Pokémon, put them to work in a sweatshop producing guns, and then do battle with these Nopémon by your side and and an assault rifle in your hands.

Watch the trailer, you'll see.

Happily, after today's Future Of Play Direct, we can provide you with a little update on that story: Cai's expansive collaborative project is due to release on Steam very soon: on August 9th, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New research published by the EU Intellectual Property Office shows that piracy remains prevalent among EU youth. The lack of affordable content is most often cited as motivation. Interestingly, piracy rates among university-educated respondents are almost double that of those who enjoyed little to no schooling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Copyright Office's inquiry on the option to add mandatory copyright protection measures in the DMCA has led to some interesting responses. They include a suggestion to add "VPN detection" tools to prevent people from engaging in "geo-piracy". This request, unsurprisingly, comes from a company that offers a VPN detection service.

The first of its kind in Canada, the flexible injunction was obtained by companies including Rogers, Bell, The Sports Network, and Groupe TVA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
