Allen Brack, who was specifically named in the initial lawsuit, stepped down less than two weeks after those initial allegations in July 2021. In November, over 1300 Activision Blizzard signed a petition demanding Kotick's resignation.

Just recently, we caught a sneaky glimpse at the dedicated workers testing and packing NES consoles back in 1989. While it hardly contained any surprises or revelations into how consoles were manufactured back in the day, it was nevertheless a fascinating look at the fine folks who worked tirelessly to ensure your beloved NES arrived in your hands in pristine condition.

The day I'll be tired of life simulators will be the day that I die, which is why I'm so excited to see another great game in the genre finally get a release date. Potion Permit is an adorable little life sim, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat (you can also play the PC demo right now, by the way). The game is set in the small town of Moonbury, where an illness has spread. As the Medical Association's most skilled potion maker, the player is tasked with helping create the cure for the ailing townsfolk.
Let's be honest, all of these games have a super cute art style, but I have to say Potion Permit has one of my favorite looks from a game like this in a long time. Plus, everything looks super polished, which is a huge plus going in. From the trailer, I can already get the sense too that we won't be in want of activities to pad out our playtimes.
https://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1539579544805548032
There's a ton to do in Moonbury — aside from diagnosing patients, finding ingredients for potions, and of course healing them, players can get to know over thirty of the town's inhabitants, fight off fearsome creatures, and upgrade the town and the surrounding areas. There are some RPG elements too, but we haven't gotten a good look at what those might be just yet.
Of everything Potion Permit has to offer, I think I'm probably most excited for all of the NPCs in the game. That's just around the number of NPCs you can give gifts to in Stardew Valley, and I don't want to play the comparison game too much here, but that always felt around just the right amount to me. Having a whole new cast of characters to befriend (and romance) in games like these is always a highlight for me, and I already have an NPC or two that I have my eyes on.
Potion Permit will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam on September 22, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.
 “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”
In the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Padding it out
Microsoft has confirmed that it is currently experiencing a shortage in supply and demand for its range of Xbox controllers. The kings of the black-and-green brand spoke about its hardware troubles in a recent statement to gaming outlet VGC, who had noticed a lack of stock online and in the high street.
"We know it may be hard finding Xbox Wireless Controllers right now due to supply disruptions," a Microsoft spokesperson told VGC. "We’re working as fast as possible with our manufacturing and retail partners to improve this. Please check with your local retailer for availability."
The shortages appear to be most apparent in the UK and Europe, though North American territories are likely to follow suit if Microsoft is unable to ramp up production. According to ResetEra users, stores in Australia and The Netherlands are also struggling to keep their stock cupboards plentiful. Both standard controllers and Xbox's cool custom "Design Lab" models are affected.
Hardware and accessory shortages have continued to trouble the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic affected production and distribution cycles worldwide. From consoles to graphics cards to controllers, publishers are struggling to produce their wares with the speed and regularity of previous generations. It is a problem expected to continue into 2023 at the very least.

Fantasy farmers will have a new way to mingle and mine in Rune Factory 5 soon. XSEED and Marvelous confirm today that Rune Factory 5 is getting a PC port on July 13.
The latest entry in the Rune Factory series launched earlier this year as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. The Steam version looks to be a similar offering. It's $59.99 for the standard edition (though it's currently on a pre-launch 15% discount) or $69.99 for the Digital Deluxe, which includes the Rune Factory 4 marriage candidates outfit set. Any pre-order also nets two cosmetic outfits and a New Ranger Care Package of items in-game.

Farming up a storm
If you're new to Rune Factory, it runs in a similar vein to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. The key difference is that Rune Factory puts a bit more of a focus on combat and exploring dungeons than the actual farming.
Depending on what you're looking for, that can be a positive or negative. In our review of the Switch launch, Rune Factory 5 seemed to be playing the hits, while not necessarily winning over new hearts thanks to falling into some familiar pitfalls. Things can get repetitive and basic at times too.
What a PC port might offer is a performance boost, which some might welcome. All-in-all, I was a big fan of Rune Factory 4 but stayed away from the next entry after hearing some early impressions of it. I'm hopeful the Steam version gives it enough of a boost to put it back on my radar.
Rune Factory 5 launches for PC via Steam on July 13, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega's Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and "engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory." The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.


The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.
The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN's Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who are you going to call?
Indie publisher Digerati has announced that DreadOut 2, the sequel to cult streaming favorite DreadOut, will be bringing its ghostly goings-on to PlayStation and Xbox platforms in July, following on from its initial release on PC way back in 2020.
https://youtu.be/EjkwgcI5hNI
DreadOut 2, much like the 2014 original, is a scare-heavy survival horror title developed by studio Digital Happiness. A third-person action-adventure, DreadOut 2 tells the tale of hardy schoolgirl "Linda Meillinda," (holy shit), who must use her psychic ghost-whispering powers to uncover and banish an army of spooky spirits that are haunting her town. Much like the popular Fatal Frame series, Linda is aided in her efforts by her camera... though the Camera Obscura here is replaced by... a smartphone.
Explore Ms. Mellinda's hometown, speak to members of both the living and the dead, take on an array of side-quests, venture into dark, desolate, and disquieting corners, or just take a literal hammer to the bonce of the undead. Keep your proton pack, Spengler. DreadOut 2 expands upon the original game with a tighter focus on both exploration and combat, but is still jam-packed with terrifying monstrosities and more than a fistful of jump scares. While it's no Resident Evil, it will certainly fit the bill for those looking for a few ghoulish scenarios on a tired evening.
DreadOut 2 launches July 15 on Xbox platforms, with PlayStation to follow on July 20, priced at around $20. It is available to purchase right now for PC via Steam.

And we're waiting to this day for this thing to still come out: even if there's a snowball's chance in hell of that happening.
Although there's been bits and bobs of news surrounding, famed game researcher Liam Robertson has provided what can be considered the definitive word: even speaking to the development team to get an update. It's dead, Jim. And the thing that ultimately helped killed it, after it clawed its way up out of hell multiple times (including a name change to WeeWaa)? Cooking Mama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glen Schoefield has made a name for himself, working on Dead Space, Call of Duty, and even Barbie: Game Girl. Heading up Striking Distance Studios, the industry icon sits down with us today to go over 83 Rapid-Fire questions focusing on The Callisto Protocol, the horror genre, and so much more!


It's Alex Stadnik's turn to host, and he has plenty of questions. One of the main focuses is getting to know The Callisto Protocol and what players can expect. We find out basic information such as what kind of weapons we'll be using, why the game takes place on the dead moon of Jupiter, and the new gruesome Biophage enemies. We also dive into inspirations, definitively answer a circulating fan theory, and much more.
But this isn't Rapid-Fire without some fun, right? We also tell Glen our best Candyman joke, see if things like The Strangers or your mom using your full name are scarier than his upcoming game, and whether or not he can think of five words that rhyme with gore. But what other secrets does Glen have up his sleeve? You'll have to watch the video to find out! 
The Callisto Protocol is releasing on December 2, 2022, for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Head to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. For more Rapid-Fire fun, check out our curated playlist on YouTube, featuring industry legends such as Tim Schafer, Joseph Staten, and Jake Solomon. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Silver Fox
Surprise! Turns out that Nexon is still not done revealing characters for its upcoming fighter DNF Duel, which is literally less than six days away from launch. Today's DNF Duel trailer introduces us to the Lost Warrior, who carries with him the undeniable presence and physical aura of a potential boss character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqaHE0JwIJ8
The Lost Warrior, as you can see in the video above, carries himself with the visual appearance of primordial times, but with a fighting style and mastery of magic beyond his years, suggesting that he may be capable of visiting multiple worlds and eras. Lost Warrior commands the battleground with devastating large strikes, reminiscent of King of Fighters' Rugal. The silver fox is also capable of switching positions with his opponent and rounds off the battle by repeatedly slamming his foe into handy nearby mountains. Ouch.
Lost Warrior is, officially, the final character to join the DNF Duel launch roster, which now totals 16 distinct and unique fighters. I'm still pretty much at a loss for who I'm gonna be digging into, but Enchantress and Inquisitor are both pretty solid calls for me. I hope to share my findings on Nexon's underdog fighter with you all soon. In the meantime, maybe check out the previous trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.
DNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make war for nostalgia's sake
Sega unveiled the new game it had previously teased today, and it's a bit out of left field. Hyenas is a new sci-fi FPS from Creative Assembly, where players compete to steal and plunder caches of merch for the rich.
The premiere arrives as part of IGN's Summer of Gaming, and was teased yesterday with a little sound bite.
Hyenas pits packs of players against each other in a bid to steal some merch. Old pop culture collectibles have become priceless artifacts in this world, so the goal is to plunder more memorabilia than the other crews and get them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0694XcFmI7M
It looks like Hyenas is really leaning into the pop culture and "irreverent" tone, as creative director Charlie Bewsher describes in a post-premiere interview. Zero-G movement and combat also look to play a factor. Each playable Hyena also has unique abilities, to cater to whatever playstyle you'd want.
Scraps of nostalgia
Hyenas really looks to be another entry in the Tarkov-influenced extraction shooter genre. We've seen plenty of these, from Rainbow Six Extraction to Battlefield 2042's Hazard Zone.
What seems to be setting Hyenas apart is the tone itself. It's taking a bright and brazen approach that feels right in line with the likes of Borderlands. That, plus hoards full of nostalgic loot and references, like the Nixon mask and a Rubik's Cube.
Creative Assembly has made some stellar games, including Alien: Isolation and the Total War games, but I can't really say I'm sold on Hyenas just yet. It will have a chance to prove itself ahead of its 2023 launch though. Sign-ups for the Alpha Test are live right now over on the game's website.
Otherwise, Hyenas is aiming to launch in 2023 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.

We’re in the midst of a Warriors series Golden Age on the Nintendo Switch. Recently, we asked you – Nintendo Life’s readers – to rank each of these Musou games, and games like Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity beat out the likes of Samurai Warriors 5 and One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3.
This got us thinking, what series would we most want to see receive a 'Musou Makeover'? As far as we’re concerned, for a game to make for a good Musou spinoff, it has to meet two requirements: a lot of playable characters, and even more enemies to cut down by the thousands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PC gets four more toggles
Capcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise camera system is getting upgraded when Sunbreak arrives, on both Switch and PC. The catch? PC users will be getting even more enhancements.
Here's a breakdown of the features found on the game's official Twitter account.
https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1539211771004821505
Here's what the Switch Monster Hunter Rise camera upgrades look like (visible here):
The ability to hide the UI
A face [the] camera option
A face [the] camera with buddies option
Here's what the PC camera upgrades look like (visible here):
The ability to hide the UI
A face [the] camera option
A face [the] camera with buddies option
Depth of field toggles (DOF)
A focus option
Blur range
Filter swaps
Folks are already celebrating the hilarious nature in which the NPCs and the player character "face the camera." Once you hit the option it forces them, seemingly against their will, to slowly turn and look at the screen. Others are loving the "face the camera with buddies" toggle — and as someone who laboriously attempted to set up tons of "face the camera" pictures on my own without the help of an instant click, I can relate.
Again, these features will arrive with the launch of Sunbreak on June 30.

Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is just around the corner. As per tradition, we've covered our own review of the game, plus a bunch of reviews from other outlets, and now Digital Foundry has provided its technical analysis of the game over on YouTube.
Let's dive right into it, then. Three Hopes tops out at 810p when docked, with portable mode slicing this down to around 540p and topping out at 648p. Digital Foundry highlights particularly poor anti-aliasing and texture filtering, exacerbated by the thin black outlines around each character. On the flip side, the superior anti-aliasing seen in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity meant that its frame rate frequently dropped well below 30.

Studio DICE has stated that it intends to entirely focus its efforts on the beleaguered Battlefield franchise going forward, eschewing new IPs and alternate franchises such as the studio's cult series Mirror's Edge while it ensures Battlefield 2042 becomes the team's core release.
Speaking in her first interview since taking the role, DICE's new General Manager Rebecka Coutaz told GamesIndustry.biz that the Battlefield franchise was the now core focus of the studio. In particular, Coutaz notes that DICE is committed to its long-term plans for blah shooter Battlefield 2042, with support expected to roll out for another three years at the very least. Asked about whether this meant Mirror's Edge or any other projects were off-the-table, Coutaz was very clear about DICE's directio…]]></summary>

Boss Fight Books are known as the publisher of multiple in-depth deep-dives of beloved video games, from Metal Gear Solid to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, each one written by mega-fan authors, writers, and developers, often with interviews from the people who made the games.
And Boss Fight have just announced their next subject: GoldenEye 007, the N64 James Bond classic that's been rumoured for a remake for some time now. Listen, we're not saying this is more proof! We're just saying that the evidence, circumstantial as it is, is mounting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Believe it or not, The Callisto Protocol is a scary game. But it’s not enough to simply have horrifying monsters and an oppressive atmosphere; developer Striking Distance believes it’s how you arrange these elements. And it does so through a process the team dubs "horror engineering." 
Horror engineering defines the meticulous manner in which the team constructs its scares so they have the maximum effect on players. That ranges from designing a room with strategically placed entry points for the biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monsters, to pop out, to obsessing over details as small as whether a light bulb should flicker two times or three. Imagine Disney’s Imagineering process applied to something much more gruesome.

There's a lot of pressure on Kingdom Hearts IV given its drastically different setting and the fact that it's a start of a new journey: something series boss Tetsuya Nomura is painfully aware of. Speaking to Game Informer, he tackled the subject of Final Fantasy characters appearing in the series (or a lack thereof). Here's what Nomura had to say on the Kingdom Hearts Final Fantasy crossover situation.
Basically, the reason the first game had a chunk of Final Fantasy characters in it is because Nomura and his team wanted to ease people into the world. He describes the Final Fantasy cast as "lending a hand" to get to know the Kingdom Hearts original creations. But once that whole universe got off the ground, they essentially served their purpose:

Final Fantasy XVI may be ratcheting up the scale, but its world won't be going fully open. In a new interview, producer Naoki Yoshida discusses the design philosophy behind the world of Final Fantasy XVI, saying it won't be an open-world RPG.
In an interview with IGN, Yoshida says players might notice inspiration from recent AAA open-world RPGs. But in order to deliver the story the team wants to make, it won't be one big, contiguous space.
"We’ve found in our extensive user research that many of the younger generation of gamers have never played a Final Fantasy or don’t have any interest in the series," Yoshida says. "To create a game that might excite and resonate not only with our core fans, but also with that new generation, we played a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

We got a Xenoblade Chronicles 3-focused Nintendo Direct earlier today which threw us in at the deep end with exposition, theatrics, and talk of philosophy, life, and characters.
But, most importantly, we got to see a lot. And we mean a lot of new visuals on the characters, the world of Aionios, and the combat. And because it's Xenoblade, there are a lot of juicy details to dig into. We're talking new aspects of combat — including the Ouroboros and classes — new characters, new locations, and just a ton of stunning vistas.

Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pass judgment before launch
If, like my good self, you've been keeping one eye on Izanagi Games' weird, melodramatic shmup Yurukill: The Calumniation Games, then here's some fine news: You can check out the entire first chapter of the incoming release today, via a new PC demo available right now on Steam. (A demo is already available on PlayStation platforms.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ7XL0ksQLY
As a quick refresher, Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is an unnerving new release that sees convicted felons forced to team up with their victims in order to survive a bizarre tournament of death — presided over by "Binko," an attractive woman in a sinister fox mask. Yurukill hopes to marry the fast-paced, pulse-pounding action of a G.rev-developed shmup with the heavy social deduction drama of a Danganronpa, all bedecked in attractive anime artwork and, of course, starring a cast of ridiculously hot hipsters. The story has been written by Homura Kawamoto of Kakegurui fame, so expect plenty of high drama and state-smashing anarchy.
The Steam demo will offer players the first chapter of Yurukill in its entirety, which will certainly give you a taste of the title's mood, atmosphere, and genre-blending gameplay. I've been hugely intrigued by this title ever since its initial announcement, so I'm definitely hoping to get to this demo later today to check out the action for myself. Oh, and should you pull the trigger on a full purchase, then your demo save data will be carried over into the main release.
Yurukill: The Calumniation Games launches in North America, July 5, on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An AI in your Eyeball.
It is hard to beat a good murder mystery. The classic battle of wits between the detective and killer makes for perfect tension and AI: The Somnium Files – nirvanA Initiative takes advantage of this established formula to give players a fun mystery with plenty of twists and turns, keeping them engaged through the closing credits and beyond.
Directed by Akira Okada and a sequel to AI: The Somnium Files from Zero Escape creator Kotaro Uchikoshi, this game features a familiar and fun juxtaposition between the comic writing and colourful characters and the gruesome nature of the killings that they are investigating. The main character, Ryuki, tends to make loud and passionate references to anime characters while looking for the culprit behind the Half Body killings, assisted by his AI companion Tama, who also happens to occupy Ryuki’s left eye socket. She feeds him information by giving him X-Ray vision or allowing him to see heat signatures, as well as by providing witty commentary as he struggles to put together the crime scene.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sick.
How hard can it be to be a doctor? We've watched ER and Casualty and Grey's Anatomy, so we know that at least 60% of a doctor's time is spent pining and kissing, and the other 40% mostly seems to be about looking really serious while sad music plays. We could hack it.
In Potion Permit, an upcoming Sim RPG for Nintendo Switch, we'll get the chance to try — with 30 residents of the village, there's always some sickness to diagnose and treat, and when you're not doctoring, you'll be foraging in the world to gather ingredients for your brews, ointments, and salves.

It's time for the Xenoblade Chronicles Direct! The third entry is getting an in-depth stream today, and we're going to recap it all.
Spoiler shield in case you want to go in blind!

We got some more story bits
The Direct kicked off with a trailer, which provided a brief look at the cabal-like group that is seemingly the antagonist faction. Then it immediately led into a crucial story conceit: "terms." 10 years is a "term" of life in which some "fight continually" as soldiers, then die. So like even-more-short-lived Clone troopers from Star Wars! All of this was accompanied by a lovely vocal ballad, which just goes to show us that the soundtrack will continue to kick ass.

When we first saw Growbot, we were utterly charmed. This lovely-looking point-and-click adventure game, developed by Wabisabi Play, has been drawn up by UK-based children's illustrator Lisa Evans — firefluff on Instagram — and features an adorable little robot called Nara who's trying to save her home from a dark force.
The robots in nature aesthetic, and the idea of saving your home from a corrupting force, reminds us heavily of Pixar's WALL-E but with a lot more nature and a little bit less pollution. Inspired by Lucasarts' point-and-clicks of the past (such as Loom) and is designed to scratch the itch of both veterans of the genre, while also encouraging newcomers into the fray.

Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that the PlayStation brand will not be in attendance at this summer's Gamescom 2022 event, nor will it be featured as part of the Opening Night Live stream.
Speaking in an interview with German publication Games Wirtschaft, a PlayStation spokesperson confirmed that the PS5 and its respective wares would not be putting in an appearance at this year's event, which takes place in Cologne, Germany in late August, PlayStation joins several other major brands including Blizzard Entertainment, Nintendo, and Take-Two who will be staying home this summer. It is likely that PlayStation is happy with the news and updates offered on its upcoming titles during the recent Sony State of Play and Summer Game Fest presentations.
This year sees Gamescom return in a physical capacity for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced restrictions on global travel and social gatherings. Gamescom 2022 has been described as a "hybrid" event by organizers, and will feature a host of online streams and activities in addition to its live show — which is once again being held in Cologne's Koelnmesse center. Gamescom, as always, will kick off with a special Opening Night Live stream, hosted by Geoff Keighley.
Gamescom 2022 will take place from August 24-28. You can check out more info and details pertaining to the event and its respective activities over on the official Gamescom website. We will, of course, be bringing you all of the top headlines over the course of the week right here on Destructoid.

Square Enix debuted a new Final Fantasy XVI trailer during a recent PlayStation State of Play. It was our biggest look yet at the upcoming RPG and the trailer revealed that Final Fantasy XVI is due out sometime during the summer of next year. 
Game Informer spoke with the game’s producer, Naoki Yoshida, who is also the director of Final Fantasy XIV, about this new "Dominance" FFXVI trailer, including the franchise's return to a more medieval setting, Eikons, boss fights, and much more.

It's wild to think that we were talking about Junker Queen in the original Overwatch five years ago — where has the time gone? With the sequel coming into focus and trying its best to justify itself (now as a free-to-play, battle-pass-powered game), the long-time-coming tank hero has stepped "out of the lore and into the light," as Blizzard puts it.
"Tanks play more aggressively in Overwatch 2," and as one of the first new characters for the game's Season 1 launch, Junker Queen has to exemplify that shift. Players can charge into battle, wound their opponents, and stay in the fight with a life-leech passive.

The Ghostbusters are back in town and will soon light up specters in a new asymmetrical multiplayer game from IllFonic, the development studio behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Predator: Hunting Grounds. In an exclusive new look at the studio's forthcoming Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, we see four proton packs charge up and ignite against a purple Slimer-like ghost with far too many eyes. This battle unfolds within a prison setting that IlllFonic felt was a must for this game.

Insane, custom gaming builds are a favorite of the internet, hence why they tend to go viral pretty much every time. A new project has been making the rounds on Reddit, and it's one of the coolest builds I've seen in a long time: a giant working Xbox Series X. According to his YouTube channel, a user called PhantomSpectre, or Michael Pick, was inspired after seeing the Xbox Series X refrigerator (and subsequent mini-fridge) that was created by Microsoft back in 2020 as a response to comments online that the new console was built like a fridge.
While that refrigerator was indeed running (and then spawned a series of lackluster mini fridges that also looked like the Series X), Pick thought it would be cool to have a console that big that actually worked as a console. The bu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big enough for the whole Bat Family
WB Montreal's Gotham Knights is sounding like a pretty big game. Or at least big in square mileage, when it comes to the city of Gotham.
In an interview with Game Informer, Gotham Knights game director Geoff Ellenor emphasizes the Batcycle's usefulness for getting around Gotham.
"It's pretty big. I haven’t put one map over the other, but our Gotham is a big place. I tend to spend a lot of my Zoom calls on the Batcyle driving around Gotham. It is one of the fastest and most chill ways to move around the city. It feels like a big place."
Gotham Knights executive producer Fleur Marty follows it up with a more direct comparison to how big this portrayal of Batman's home will be.
"For sure it’s the biggest version of Gotham that has been represented in video games," said Fleur. "The most important thing for us is its density and verticality. It has a lot of layers. The Batcycle is the long-range mode of transportation."

Knight court
That's a big Gotham then, if we're comparing it to the likes of Arkham Knight. Good to know the Batfamily may have lost Bruce but kept some wheels around.
As for other tidbits from Game Informer's coverage, the pair also addresses what happens when two players pick the same character. It sounds like it's not only possible, but has some funny ramifications.
"We’re leaving it up to players.," said Fleur. "We know some people will want to have different characters, but some won’t care. I don’t want to spoil anything, but there’s a funny moment in the game if you are playing as two of the same character."
I'm hoping for a "two Robins walk into a bar" joke somewhere. Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on Oct. 25, 2022.

This week, Fortnite gets even more Naruto characters in the mix. Four more characters from the manga and anime series are dropping into Fortnite's Item Shop on June 23, this Thursday.
The four candidates chosen this time around are some recognizable faces, even if you're not too familiar with Naruto. Itachi Uchiha and Orochimaru bring some menacing presence to the field, while Gaara is the rival-turned-ally of the group. Also joining the crew is Hinata, a Hyuga clan Shinobi who grows close to the cast, especially Naruto.
Add these to the already added Naruto characters in Fortnite, like Sasuke and the titular shinobi, and you've got a lot of options for fans of the ninja-themed series.

Alongside the skins themselves, there are also a bunch of backpacks, gliders, and emotes to pick up as part of this "Rivals" drop. There are bundles too, packing together some of the characters, cosmetics, and some loading screens as well. You can find the full rundown here.
Return to the village
Additionally, from 8 p.m. ET on June 23 to 8 p.m. ET on July 7, the gates to the Hidden Leaf Village Map will open up again. The adventure area has plenty of locations to explore, as well as quests to complete and unlock more areas. Nindo Community Challenges are also back, oepning up today to earn some cosmetic rewards.
Now, I'm not the biggest Naruto fan, so these admittedly do little for me. But if I may still make a humble request: if we're going to keep adding Naruto characters to Fortnite, Rock Lee needs to be in the picture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol comes from the minds that spawned the Dead Space franchise, and it has more than a little in common with Isaac Clarke’s horrifying adventures. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have plenty of original ideas, but there are several mechanical, narrative, and visual nods that fans of EA’s premier horror franchise will recognize. Here are the biggest overlaps between the two. 
It Stars An Everyman
Jacob Lee, like Isaac Clarke, isn’t a soldier or trained fighter. He’s a cargo ship pilot who crash-lands on Callisto, which leads to his arrest and imprisonment. We don’t know why his arrival put him on the wrong side of the law, only that he “didn’t get a warm reception on Callisto,” according to Striking Distance. Although he can use a gun well enough, don’t expect Jacob to mow th…]]></summary>

The filing, made last year and published this past week, describes a head-mounted display with a rear housing, and the mechanisms by which that display could be adjusted. It's not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the Borderlands-meets-DND spin-off from earlier this year, is finally coming to Steam, publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software announced today. You'll be able to play it on June 23.
Two different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, "Chaotic Great Edition." The latter includes the game's season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. 
Across all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: 
The last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. "This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage," Gearbox said in a press release.
According to our reviewer, Tiny Tina's Wonderland is really good. As we said, it's "upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new and improved PlayStation Plus is live and surprisingly great. 
Of course, it has all the titles you might expect: God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and a bunch of other triple-A games. Whatever. But there's more to it than PlayStation's ever-growing list of really expensive games.
I had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. 
To my delight, it's full of weirdo games you probably haven't heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of "Does this look weird and/or interesting?" It's been a blast. 
I finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It's also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. 
I also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It's an objectively bad game but I can't help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she's evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it's bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.
Next up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can't wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you're finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that's a great game. Drop down to the comments and let me know what weirdo games I should play next!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Art exhibition coming to Tokyo this summer
This year sees the 20th anniversary of the cult JRPG franchise .hack//. To celebrate two decades of dystopian sci-fi action, publisher Bandai Namco has announced several different endeavors that will look back at the video games, manga, anime, and novels set within CyberConnect2's new millennium.
The original run of the .hack manga has been digitally republished and is available for Japanese fans to purchase between now and July 4 directly from the CyberConnect2 website. In addition, a special anniversary book will launch on July 19, looking back at every release in the series — from the original  2002 PS2 release .hack//Infection through collectible card title .hack//Enemy. Unfortunately, Bandai Namco did not announce any plans to localize these re-releases for western fans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ulUhubUdYc
A special exhibition will also be installed at Yurakucho Marui in Chiyoda, Tokyo between the dates of August 9 and August 28, 2022. The installation will feature original concept artwork and other audio/visual elements celebrating the multimedia franchise. In December, a second commemorative anniversary book will also be released, alongside a special three-CD set of .hack's evocative and melodramatic score.
But what in the way of new games? Well, Bandai Namco has not offered any such reveal, or even the announcement of a reveal, but mystery still surrounds the "Last Recollection" trademark, which the publisher filed back in April of this year. It is believed that this pertains to an as-yet-unannounced set of the four mainline titles in the .hack franchise, namely .hack//Infection, .hack//Mutation, .hack//Outbreak, and finally .hack//Quarantine. So just sit tight for new news, hack squad.

It's been a long time coming, but we are now one week away from the launch of Nexon's cool-looking fighter, DNF Duel. Y'all excited? I know I am, just for the roster at the very least. The publisher has chosen to stoke the hype fire one last time by releasing the game's opening cinematic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruRh8RGLRVM
Originally announced in 2019, (and widely covered by yer boy since), DNF Duel is a one-on-one fighter adapted from the popular Korean MMO Dungeon Fighter Online. DNF Duel repurposes an arsenal of DFO classes as individual roster members, including Fighter, Grappler, Inquisitor, Dragon Knight, Kunoichi, and many others. With gameplay designed by Guilty Gear's Arc System Works, and some very impressive visuals, DNF Duel is looking to make an impact in the coming FGC summer season.
DNF Duel will feature rollback netcode on PS4 and PC, though will sadly not support crossplay, at least not at launch. In addition to online battles, the fighter will include a single-player story mode, training facilities, survival mode, a gallery, and more. There is no denying that it is an unknown IP in the fighting game world, and is up against stiff competition from current and upcoming games. But it looks like Nexon's underdog hopes to come out swingin' and carve a niche all of its very own.
DNF Duel will launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28. Be sure to check out the dynamic character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Falling, free falling
The frenetic platformer royale Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout goes free-to-play and adds some new platforms today. The Free For All season is live now, and Fall Guys is officially launched for Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.
News of this update arrived last month, revealing Mediatonic's gameshow-style competition is coming to new platforms. With today's update, Fall Guys is now free to play on all platforms. It also has cross-play across all platforms, so the party doesn't stop when you swap over. Mediatonic also confirms in an FAQ that the new season makes Fall Guys cross-progression as well.
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1539235705460776962
Today's update also marks the launch of the new Season Pass. Everyone gets access to 50 levels, while legacy players—those who bought Fall Guys when it first launched—get the whole thing free.
Grab a hold of the ledge
Some more updates are in store for Fall Guys today as well. Alongside the new cosmetics in the Season Pass, some new courses are being added. Hex-A-Ring, Volleyfall, Speed Circuit, Track Attack, Bounce Party, The Swiveller, and Blast Ball are all added in to the game.
An Auto Grab option is also available, letting players automatically grab ledges. You can also now dive-grab Tails and Crowns, which is sure to make some of those protect-your-tail rounds more interesting. Voice Chat is also enabled in Parties.
One note is that while Steam owners will continue to be able to play Fall Guys and get all the updates, the platformer royale won't have a Steam store page anymore. Any new players picking up Fall Guys on PC today will need to play through the Epic Games Store.
With all the new cosmetics and courses, as well as cross-platform play, it really does seem like a good summer to get back into Fall Guys. Time to get my hot-dog suit out of the closet and chase some Crowns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.


Join Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn's dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what's happening on the moon.
While that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can't go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you'll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.
If that's not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's out on Steam on June 23
A Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Steam release is imminent as Gearbox has just revealed that the game is coming to the platform on June 23. That's this week!
Originally released on March 25, 2022, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands came out on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and...PC, but only on the Epic Games Store. While many games have longer exclusivity windows, Wonderlands will hit Steam in less than three months, which isn't bad in the grand scheme of things. Gearbox has announced that the exact release time for Wonderlands Steam is actually 10AM PT on June 23. It'll debut with a standard edition for $60, or the special [Chaotic Great] edition for $79.99 (which includes the season pass) — if you buy in on Steam through July 7, 2022, you'll get the golden hero armor pack.
So, a few quick things about the Wonderlands Steam edition. Gearbox says that save data can be transferred between Steam and Epic, "but will need to be moved manually." Annoyingly, the publisher says that "players run the risk of potentially losing save files," and suggests that users "make a backup copy." This kind of goes without saying, but it's good to reiterate every now and then. The Steam version will also support cross-play, and will not be left out of that party. Oh, and the Molten Mirrors DLC is out this week, which will be live alongside of the Steam edition. It's the third (of four) "Mirrors of Mystery" DLC packs, which comprise the season pass.
You can find the Steam page for the game here. Again, it'll be live on June 23 at 10AM PT.

It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. 
According to Hawk, the "plan" was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. 
"The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn't really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios," Hawk says in the clip. "Like, 'What would you do with a THPS title?' And they didn't like anything they heard, and then that was it."
You can watch the full clip below: 
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔
https://t.co/84rlYDgvUQ pic.twitter.com/oWR70xTOYv
June 20, 2022
At the very least, it doesn't sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision's interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that's been a bad idea.  
The news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  "the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past." Alas, history proves otherwise. 
But actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there's Vicarious Visions' Tony Hawk's Pro Skater reboot. There's also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.]]></summary>

Modder CraftyBoss managed to do something that probably should have been done a long time ago: a Super Mario Odyssey multiplayer mod.
Housed on their Discord server, the mod (which requires a modded Switch) allows up to 10 people to play Mario Odyssey together, with different costumes to differentiate everyone: that actually sync while playing. The mod itself is a work in progress, as is the custom game mode concept, but for now, the basics seem to be working.
Interestingly, moon collection (collectibles that dictate game progress) "is shared between all players." Meaning, you could have an entire crew jump into a level, and either play it separately to divide and conquer, or hang out together and go for the same objective. It reminds me of Castlevania: Harmony of Despair's core gimmick (man that game needs to come back on modern platforms!).
While Mario Odyssey felt more than complete on its own, something like this, even if it was just a few players at a time, gives it new life. "What if [X] had multiplayer" is something people have been pondering for decades in the realm of gaming, and mods have typically been the way to deliver on that dream.

While the studio — which was originally founded in 1992 by ex-Konami coder Masato Maegawa — has offered no direct information in regards to the new game's IP, form, or genre, Treasure has noted that the project is something that its fans have been requesting for quite some time, which has got the company's dedicated, long-time fanbase buzzing with excitement and intrigue.
https://twitter.com/TreasureCoLtd/status/1538446520977985536?s=20&t=9OJMkYLupw94PAZdA8yaxw
"On June 19, 2022, Treasure celebrated its 30th anniversary!" wrote the developer on its official Twitter. "On this 30th anniversary year, we are working hard in development to announce the highly requested 'that'. Please continue to give Treasure your support going forward."
While the tweet makes it sound like the title will be a known entity, such as a sequel or remake, that still leaves a whole lot of mystery up in the air. After all, Treasure's catalog of franchises are all incredibly popular, and fans would be pleased with a sequel to any of the aforementioned games. Of course, we could simply be looking at a major remaster or remake of one of its enduring classics — Ikaruga for example — but frankly, at this stage, I think the fans are just happy to see the studio back at it.
Let the speculation commence. We'll be sure to give you the good word when Treasure shows its hand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Darth Vader was apparently sick and tired of being trapped in Fortnite's Battle Pass and is now waging war against all players. In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won't hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you'll get his lightsaber as a reward.
Vader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It'll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.
Vader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. 
His lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here's hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!]]></summary>

RiotPWR is no stranger to creating controllers with mobile gaming in mind, but today’s reveal is the result of a collaboration and partnership with Xbox. The team set out to “develop and manufacture a full form-factor mobile gaming controller to enhance Xbox Cloud Gaming with high-quality, dedicated equipment,” and who better to work with on this than the people at Xbox. Dubbed the RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition), this controller is available to preorder starting today. RiotPWR will release it on Aug. 1 but if you preorder today, you’ll get 10% off the price. 


“The RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition) is Lightning-connected, therefore requires zero batteries or Bluetooth to use, and has a removable, adjustable phone mount display,” a press release from RiotPWR reads. “It also includes RiotPWR’s unique pass-through charging feature that allows users to charge their mobile device while using the controller without worrying about a low battery interrupting their game. Users can even record their gameplay with the push of a button and plug in headphones to fully immerse themselves in their games.” 
This controller is available to preorder today and will be released online and at various retailers on Aug. 1.

Microsoft has just revealed this morning that a Far Cry 5 Game Pass release is on the horizon. It's not one of those let-down "oh it's coming to Xbox Game Pass, but cloud only" (cue Microsoft exec laughs) deals either. It's hitting Xbox Game Pass on July 1 on everything: cloud, console, and PC.
It's not alone, either. The Shadowrun Trilogy is set to debut on Xbox Game Pass today, on both cloud devices and consoles. It's significant in that it's actually three games: Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong. The rest of the week is rounded out by Total War: Three Kingdoms, FIFA 22, and Naraka: Bladepoint. As usual, Game Pass is getting down with a degree of variety with its offerings: tactical RPGs, sports, and AAA shooters. Not bad!
Microsoft also reminds folks that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge recently came out on Game Pass, which is perfect for the service for those who are on the fence about a beat 'em up.
Xbox Game Pass week of June 20:
Shadowrun Trilogy, June 21 (Cloud and Console)
Total War: Three Kingdoms, June 21 (PC)
FIFA 22, June 23 (Console and PC)
Naraka: Bladepoint, June 23 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Xbox Game Pass week of June 27:

While fans often debate the merits of modern Sonic the Hedgehog video games, the consensus is that the ‘90s were the franchise’s most consistently great years. Sonic Origins gathers the four games most attributed to that notion, delivering a stellar group of classic titles at its core. But through several modernizations and updates, Sonic Origins makes a strong case for being the best official way to experience Sonic’s heyday in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the reveal that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 is called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about remakes, their purpose in video games, and what games need and don’t need them. 
As a bottom line, I’m not opposed to any remake. If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice. Well, it turns out FF7R is one of my favorite games ever. Plus, at the end of the day, in many cases, the original game is still there for me to play should I wish to do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

As you can see, this direct is not going to be the one many people were expecting; you know, the one where Nintendo discusses its plans for the rest of 2022 regarding the Switch. Instead, we’re getting 20 minutes of Nintendo’s next big release, Xenoblade Chronicles 3. If you’re excited about Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, then Wednesday is going to be your favorite day this week. 
While waiting for the direct, check out the reveal trailer of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and then read about how its release date moved from September to July.

What would happen to Gotham City if Batman stopped protecting it? We'll soon find out in Warner Bros. Montreal's Gotham Knights, a story-based action/RPG that begins with Batman's death. As criminals try to take advantage of Batman's absence, his understudies are trying to keep order. Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin, and Nightwing unite to maintain order, but quickly learn Gotham now bends to the will of the mysterious Court of Owls.
I talked to Gotham Knights' executive producer Fleur Marty and game director Geoff Ellenor about what players can expect to experience from this…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evil West is the upcoming Wild West action game from developer Flying Wild Hog, the studio behind the fast-paced Shadow Warrior series, and it’s due out this September. It got an excellent trailer during both The Game Awards 2020 and The Game Awards 2021, as well as a new look during the past few weeks of video game showcases. 
Now, it’s back with a new trailer that highlights more than 10 minutes of rootin’ tootin’ western action, with plenty of vampires, of course, and it looks like a great time. If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. 
Check it out for yourself below: 

As you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. 
For more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West.

That’s because apparently, the lyrics in most Elden Ring songs are completely gibberish and void of meaning. This news comes from Eurogamer, which discovered Reddit user Magister Organi, a student studying Latin, and their diligent attempted translation of the songs of Elden Ring. Organi confirmed that most of the lyrics are gibberish, and they even apparently reached out to an Elden Ring music producer to verify their findings.

Epic would like their Epic Games Store to also be wormy, and an early step is, hey, still about Steam. The Epic Online Services SDK 1.15, released this week, includes tools that let developers enable crossplay between players on Epic Games Store and players of the same game on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.
Releasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer Editor-In-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner)

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/06/17/nerf-introduces-its-first-mascot-murph"/>
        <updated>2022-06-17T20:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.
Murph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.
Below are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. 

In a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: 
“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”
If you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.
Where on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. 
The Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. 
Fans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. 
Another Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development.

Instead, we had the third annual Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest and a handful of connected and not-so-connected streams and events from other gaming media outlets and publishers. While we had a full weekend of games on display and more than enough to cover, there's something about the current setup for the game industry's biggest info dump of the year that's leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.
What I'd like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it. All the better if these events could coalesce in one general location. We used to have a good seven days or so of events, press conferences…]]></summary>

I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan. Still, this “unparalleled ambition” worries me. 
Sunday’s gameplay footage ended with what Bethesda likely thought was a big bang (pun intended). Players can land anywhere on any planet in any solar system of their choice or, as Howard excitedly put it, “Over 100 systems. Over 1,000 planets.

Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer's Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

I am delighted to see some of the gentle pleasure and wonder of that captured in Naiad, an upcoming game about a water spirit adventuring downstream. It has a free demo in the Steam Next Fest, and it is quite lovely. I believe it to be what the youth call 'wholesome'.

I'd seen it in a hands-off capacity and thought it looked like it could be in line for the Soulslike throne, but with Action-RPGs it's all about hand feel: does it feel rough or smooth under the thumbsticks? As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that "an objective review" from external advisors "determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence "suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board."
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that "there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units" in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, "based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 is coming to consoles and PC later this year as an Early Access free-to-play title. With that change in business model, Blizzard Entertainment is now offering a bundle for the unreleased game with plenty of cosmetics and extras, including beta access. However, it's going to set you back about the full price of a game.
Clocking in at $39.99, Overwatch 2's first content bundle, dubbed the Overwatch Watchpoint Pack, does include a game you can play right now. It's the Legendary Edition of the original Overwatch which comes with some additional skins for characters and is probably necessary for the next piece of the bundle; purchasers will also be granted access to the upcoming Overwatch 2 beta, which starts on June 28. When the game launches into Early Access proper in October, the Watchpoint Pack covers the cost of the initial season pass and grants skins, in-game currency, and more.
Here are the entire contents of the Watchpoint Pack: 
Guaranteed access to the Overwatch 2 PvP Crossplay Beta (Beta begins June 28th, 2022)
Overwatch: Legendary Edition (includes five (5) Legendary Skins and five (5) Epic Skins)
Additional content granted to purchasers at the release of Overwatch 2 on October 4th
Premium Battle Pass: Season 1 - Two (2) Overwatch
2 Legendary Hero Skins - Space Raider Soldier 76 and Space Raider Cassidy
2000 Overwatch 2 Virtual Currency - Overwatch
2 Player Icon (Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack pre-purchase exclusive)
The Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack is available on all platforms Overwatch 2 which will be available: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Early Access of OW2 starts on October 4, and includes a new character, The Junker Queen. Our own Brian Shea spoke with the Overwatch team about this upcoming game and shift to free-to-play, and you can read his preview of it here.]]></summary>

First up, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade leaves Epic exclusivity to steer its motorbike onto Steam today. Steam Deck compatibility was touted too, you lucky beggars.


Then, after much faffing with mobile games and memorabilia, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed footage from the second part of Remake, now known as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Kitase also confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga might actually be completed in our lifetimes, thanks to Square Enix deciding to draw it to a close with a third, as yet untitled part.

It turns out the answer is three. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that there’s only one untitled game left after Rebirth launches next year. Following a three-game roadmap is fitting given that the original Final Fantasy VII consisted of three discs on PS1. Kitase, unsurprisingly, did not give a window for when the final game will arrive.

A cinematic trailer provided tantalizing glimpses of what’s to come, most notably gameplay of Cloud and Sephiroth exploring a section of the world together. While that may very well be a flashback, those who played Remake know that anything is possible at this point. Today's video also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second entry in what will be a three-game series.

        <updated>2022-06-16T22:23:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Capcom's Dragon's Dogma 10th-anniversary celebrations, a sequel has finally been announced. Dragon's Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.


The announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that's passed since Dragon's Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game's director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name "Dragon's Dogma II," which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.
Before the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon's Dogma. It's a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.
There's no date for Dragon's Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company's RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.

Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.
Shredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”

All's well that ends well, though. In response to "overwhelming community response", Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past week, we've witnessed an obscene amount of trailers featuring promising upcoming games, many of which are coming from talented independent developers. Events like Steam's Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.
The ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of "show floor" demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren't complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.
Xbox isn't ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.
Batora: Lost Haven
Broken Pieces
Severed Steel
Tinykin
Some of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can't wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.]]></summary>

Admittedly, "world record" is less impressive when only developers and media have played, and I expect to be toppled soon after it launches today. Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I've had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I've stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

However, PlayStation seemingly had other (accidental) plans as the publisher leaked everything about Part I hours before its official reveal. 
Keighley and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann took shots at PlayStation during the showcase, and it was clear the two were upset about the leak. Nonetheless, The Last of Us remake is real, and it’s out on Sept. 2. With all that behind it now, fans have begun to focus on the visual updates of Part I, which has seemingly split the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The auto-attacking action of Vampire Survivors and rude 'tude of Flash games combines in Brotato, an upcoming indie game with a free demo available in the Steam Next Fest right now. We play as a potato dodging around waves of aliens while blasting them with sticks, stones, guns, knives, rocket launchers, and weird mutations. I mean it as a great compliment when I say the roguelikelike arena survive 'em up feels like a Newgrounds game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinifactory developers Zachtronics have revealed what they say is their last game, Last Call BBS. It’s a compilation of eight smaller games, some new and some reworked elements of previous games. These range from assembling Gundam-esque models to the tile-matching from Exapunks, now with an added single–player campaign. Of course, there’s two solitaire games thrown in for good measure too. Check out Zachtronics’ last hurrah in the trailer below.

It was amazing when I played its early build last year, and its Steam Next Fest demo is somehow even better. How could it not be! Have you seen it? Anger Foot is a game about kicking doors at muppet men. That’s it. That’s the pitch. It rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farthest Frontier, which arrives on Steam Early Access on August 9th, sounds as much of a statement of intent as it does the name of a city-building game. It’s a combination of town management and survival sim, putting you in the presumably cheap clogs of a band of settlers trying to make a go of it in the wilderness. A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.

In 2021, while interviewing creator Ben Esposito about then-upcoming Neon White, he told me he wasn't trying to make a game appealing to everyone. He wanted Neon White to appeal to "really specific people."
Put another way, as Esposito said in one of the game's trailers, it's a game made for "freaks."
I guess that makes me a freak, then. Because Neon White is my favorite game I've played all year – by a large margin.
You assume the role of Neon White; a dead assassin pulled from Hell for a divine competition. Demons overrun Heaven, so the powers that be task White and a host of damned…]]></summary>

It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn't know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles carved its perfect niche in video games by way of the cooperative beat ‘em up. Titles like the 1989 arcade game and Turtles in Time let fans fulfill the fantasy of kicking shell alongside their friends, but it’s been a long time since our green heroes were the stars of a great video game. Shredder’s Revenge ends that drought, serving as a lovingly crafted homage to TMNT’s glory days that gives fans what they remember while sanding down most of the rough edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall kicked off the recent Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase with a brand new look at gameplay. Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. 
Following that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. 


“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.'"
Smith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. 
Of course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase.

Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting's first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category.

The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you're willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That's a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a "farmadventure", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a "survival game without survival"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase has been and gone, but Not E3 is far from over. Including, as it turns out, for Xbox and Bethesda: tonight’s Xbox Games Showcase Extended stream will take a deeper dive into some of the many games that were announced during the main show on Sunday, with new trailers and extended interviews. Liam and I will be liveblogging the whole thing, despite him having stayed up until God-knows-when last night watching Capcom’s Resident Evil and dinosaur genocide announcements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The collective JRPG fandom did a little squee and cartwheeled when Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 Portable were announced for PC at Sunday’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. There was no word on whether either game would make their way to Steam like Persona 4 Golden, though. Well, never fear, because developers Atlus say both games will be coming to Valve’s storefront, as Eurogamer report. In case you missed the trailer, here it is below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.

Shutdowns, raids, arrests, and site-blocking orders have repeatedly made headlines. Against this backdrop, it's surprising to see that piracy has become more popular, with YouTube and Facebook now the top sources to access content illegally. Meanwhile, password sharing is a growing concern too.

Like in Vampire Survivors, I think the roguelikelike arcade shooter's real victory condition is spewing so many bullets and explosions and fireballs and lightning strikes and ice shards that the framerate starts chugging. As far as I'm concerned, when the game can no longer process just how ridiculous my run is, I've beaten it and I win. Reader dear, I'm delighted to say I finally managed that in 20 Minutes Till Dawn. I finally won.

Revealed as part of their not E3 livestream, the Winter's Expansion will include three seperate additions to entice fans back into its world of tall vampire ladies and weird dog men.
The first is Shadow Of Rose, a story expansion set after the events of the base game that focuses on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters. In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious "powers", Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village. Players will guide Rose through a number of spooky locales, including what appears to be Castle Dimetrescu from the game's main campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Capcom announced Exoprimal, an action game devised by your six-year-old self where players jump into badass exosuit and then machine-gun roiling hordes of dinosaurs, Alice0 believed that you fought the big lizard-birds with the help of an AI. In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight's Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

Normally getting a good AiO of this size costs around £100 to £180, but right now Amazon is offering the MSI MAG CoreLiquid 280R for half price: just £50. That's an awesome value for a high-performance CPU cooler that even includes RGB lighting.

There's no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn't matter that you're a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you'll have a great time doing it.

It’s the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it’s also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally glimpsed our first look at some in-game footage from interstellar RPG Starfield at yesterday’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, and it had the feel of a less retro Fallout 4. Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.

NotE3 was in full swing this weekend but wasn't the only gawp-o-rama around, with Screenshot Saturday still giving looks at birds, a goth Deus Ex, and a vision of an open-world Sonic the Hedgehog chillout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.
