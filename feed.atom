        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a handful of rhythm games on PC, but a lot of them are ultra-hard, anime-drenched tests of reflexes and memorisation. I like my rhythm games on the other end of the scale, containing playful minigames with silly concepts and stories. Think Rhythm Heaven. Think Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan.

Think, perhaps, Melatonin. It's an in-development rhythm game about dreams merging with reality, and looks like exactly my thing. Watch the trailer below.

What if there was a way to stop the aging process and only your family knew the secret? How far would you go to protect it? And at what cost? The Centennial Case isn’t your typical murder-mystery adventure game. It goes out of its way to be different, whether it’s swapping you to various murders over the course of 100 years or using live-action footage to make you feel like you’re participating in a movie. The latter evokes a nostalgic feeling of the FMV games of yore, but the advanced tech and heavy focus on deduction create an experience …]]></summary>

The new season of Destiny 2 goes live today, and a rework of the Solar subclass arrives alongside it. Destiny 2 Season of the Haunted adds new abilities to each class' Solar capabilities, from more hammer-time to more anime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pqu5n-zao8
A new video published this morning goes into detail about what's in store for each Solar subclass. Past reworks have shaken up subclasses quite a bit, but these seem focused on several new abilities, adding some more "oomph" to the moveset. The Bungie developers jokingly refer to this as "Operation Caliente," meant to spice up abilities that have been stagnant.
Titans get a flashy hammer move called Consecration, which lets them uppercut up into the air with twin hammers and slam …]]></summary>

Every day, we're learning something new about what we can — and crucially can't — expect from the tiered PlayStation Plus revamp launching on June 13 in North America. Today, it's a caveat about the subscription's streamable PS3 games: namely, you won't be able to access any of their DLC. This was an issue before with cloud-based games played via PlayStation Now, and it'll still be present with PlayStation Plus Premium.
As pointed out by Video Games Chronicle, Sony confirmed this week that "DLC and add-on content is not supported when streaming a title."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Family Feud
Japanese indie dev nekogameteacher, (of Super Drink Bros. fame), is back on the scene with an equally nutty title with an equally silly premise. Currently in development for PC, Family Battle: Tag Arena promises multiplayer mayhem in a colorful anime world that hosts one too many superheroes.
You'll have to bear with me, as details are understandably muddled, but it appears that Family Battle, true to its title, is the tale of two extended families of superpowered heroes, facing off to determine who is the one true "Super Family." This war will play out in a series of two-on-two arena-based battles, with teams stepping into the role of their chosen family members — all of which carry their own unique skills, abilities, powers, and play styles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZKNRlCIdGQ
With one player in the role of "Attacker" and a second player as "Support," the two teams engage in fast-paced and chaotic 3D warfare, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks as well as their own respective powers to take the fight. While the attacking characters get down and dirty on the front line, it is up to the supporting player to disrupt the enemy from long-range — laying traps, clearing out hazards, or providing their partner with offensive and defensive buffs. With strong chemistry and quick communication, a team can use its strategy and synergy to bring the bragging rights back home.
Family Battle: Tag Arena is currently in development for PC (via Steam). It will enter an Early Access period from August 6, but you can check out the official store page right now. Do it for The Family.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.
A PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. 


The DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. 
The controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  
To learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.]]></summary>

Fans of the Call of Duty series expect a new game every year, but there's always plenty of hype when the new release dates start rolling around. That's at least the case for me, maybe because I'm still a baby CoD fan, because I'm pumped to try out the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, especially now that it has a release date. They're really building the suspense on this one — first the logo reveal last month, now the art reveal, and then some potential new announcements teased for the future.
The Call of Duty Twitter officially revealed the next franchise entry's release date this morning: October 28, 2022. Along with that info, we also got a short video showing off the art for some of the game's characters, which includes a return of Task Force 141, who were also principal characters in the original Modern Warfare 2. We also caught a glimpse of a mysterious numbered sequence that reads "J-8-22" at around the 44-second mark, which just might be an important date for fans to look forward to.
https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1529137835764228097
This title is actually a reboot sequel of the 2009 game with the exact same name, something that has caused a few fans (including myself) a bit of confusion this time around. Modern Warfare 2 is truly a beloved title in Call of Duty history, so it makes a lot of sense that Activision would want to bring it back for another go-around. We got some really iconic missions from that game, like "Wolverines!" and "Cliffhanger," so here's hoping we get to see some other really memorable adventures this time around, too.
I personally love a good sniper mission, but something I always look forward to in a good CoD campaign is those larger-than-life set pieces. Here's hoping that Infinity Ward can deliver this time around, and revamp the series in a way we've needed in the past few years.

Numskull Games has given us a sneak peek ahead of time at all of the gameplay systems coming to retro throwback Final Vendetta. From these five minutes of footage alone, it's plain to see that this is a love letter to Streets of Rage, Double Dragon, and Final Fight. You'll be punching and kicking your way through the streets of London to rescue your sister from a crime gang.
The preview is an overview of how to play the game, and what moves you'll be able to tackle foes with Final Vendetta. Numskull Games showcases the game's unique block button, the ability to attack someone behind you, and — to make enemies feel really humiliated — kick them when they're face-first on the floor. Dying mid-brawl will drop you back into battle quickly and will also clear the screen — the thud of your impact really is that powerful!

Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime has a book to sell, and we're learning all sorts of fascinating info from his time at Nintendo as a result. This time, we're learning about the Nintendo online play situation: specifically why the company took forever to actually implement it in earnest.
Speaking to the GeekWire podcast (via Nintendo Life), Reggie elucidated on what a lot of folks assumed over the years regarding Nintendo's slow play with online, with some inside info. Noting that Nintendo has always been interested in "doing things differently," he highlighted the strong historical push for couch co-op, going all the way up to the Wii era with Wii Sports (something else Reggie knows quite a bit about).

You might have heard the hot scoop that Kazuma Kiryu is about to guest star in Rainbow Six Siege. Well, he isn't, but his suit and haircut sure are. Ubisoft has announced that it is collaborating with Sega to bring character skins of the Yakuza hero — as well as his one-time love interest and ass-kicking partner, Kaoru Sayama — to its popular online squad shooter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rnZeKj9SWM
The Rainbow Six Siege Yakuza Bundle, which launches on all platforms today, includes looks for Siege's resident "Team Japan," Hibana and Echo. In addition to the character skins, new weapon skins will kit Hibana out with a Police-themed rifle skin, while Echo gets a pearl-colored rifle skin emblazoned with the legendary Dragon of Dojima. Though these are, essentially, Siege characters in cosplay, it's still pretty weird to see even a dollar store Kazuma carrying a gun. Later this season, a new Elite skin will see Echo transform into the wildly unpredictable Goro Majima, as teased in the above trailer.
This is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege has ventured into "guest skins" territory. Back in 2020, Rainbow squad leader Ash got her Lara Croft on, while 2021 saw Zofia don the iconic S.T.A.R.S. garb of Resident Evil's Jill Valentine. These crossover costumes are part of Rainbow Six Siege's continued progression into a wider universe of lore — evolving from its nationalistic and stringently militant, roots into a more approachable, character-driven, alternate universe. Another example of this new direction lies in the icky, sci-fi sensibilities of 2021's Rainbow Six Extraction, which saw the counter-terrorist team battle a literal alien invasion.
Rainbow Six Siege and Rainbow Six Extraction are available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. The Rainbow Six Siege Yakuza Bundle is available on all platforms today.

Sonic Origins is meant to be a celebration of classic Sonic, the first time that all four main games from the Mega Drive/Genesis era — Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD — have been compiled together. And from the looks of the gameplay trailer shared earlier this month, it seems like it will be!
The collection comes with a number of different modes, including Anniversary Mode (that comes with a bunch of modern day features), Classic Mode, and a brand new Story Mode. This will feature some fancy new animated cutscenes and will let you play through the games in chronological order (not release order, which is why CD comes before Sonic 2).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's time for the annual "where's the sequel?" chant
The Dragon's Dogma 10th anniversary is underway, and Capcom is celebrating it with (!)...a website dedicated to the series. It's one of the most Capcom things we'll see all week!
Amid a historical breakdown of the several projects that the franchise has produced, we get a short message from the game's legendary director Hideaki Itsuno (who is still at Capcom, and still wants to make a sequel):
"Dragon's Dogma, first released in 2012, is celebrating its 10th anniversary! Thank you, Arisen, for taking up arms and braving through the impossible challenges laid ahead of you. We are forever grateful for your support throughout the years and hope you will join us in this momentous celebration of Dragon's Dogma!"

As a reminder, Dragon's Dogma launched in 2012, and was eventually awarded an expansion-re-release of sorts with Dark Arisen. In 2015, Dragon's Dogma Online was released exclusively in Japan, which didn't help keep up the series' cachet worldwide. In 2020, an anime adaptation debuted on Netflix. We're still waiting for a cold hard sequel or a true follow-up.
Hopefully, this Dragon's Dogma 10th anniversary website is the start of that campaign. While the art is lovely, the site isn't too much to look at currently. Out of the six "historical bullet points," three of them are for ports of Dark Arisen on various platforms.
Still, sequel-begging aside, this series deserves to be celebrated in some fashion, and if this is all we're getting, at least it's something.

A new mod for Elden Ring aims to make co-op persist beyond the fog door, and it's going into beta this week. Modder LukeYui's seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring is going into public beta on May 27.
Yes, Elden Ring does already support co-op. But it is limited to certain areas and generally feels like it's meant for tackling bosses or tough areas, rather than exploring the Lands Between together. The seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring could change that.
Shown off in a video, LukeYui's mod allows for multiple players to ride their horses, get shared rewards from great enemies, and engage in PvP. Even when the host dies, they can spectate the other player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKuJO9nK-8
The mod will go live on NexusMods on May 27. No indication's been made towards how long it will stay up. But several alpha testers will also be streaming the co-op action. You can find their Twitch links in the mod's trailer description.
The Fellowship of the Elden Ring
It's a pretty cool thought that, if this mod pans out well, players could truly co-op great swathes of Elden Ring. While the drop-in co-op works right now, it's really only for spurts. Being able to run the entirety of an area, or just explore together, is something else entirely.
Of course, Elden Ring has already been a hotbed for neat mods. Some let you summon bosses, or even infamous boss-killers. One project is trying to put FromSoftware's latest into the realm of virtual reality. And another went the hardware route, making a Fisher-Price controller work with Elden Ring.
It's safe to say Elden Ring is one of the year's biggest releases. As time rolls on though, I'm looking forward to more of what modders can do with the massive world FromSoft has made. And letting me and three of my friends engage in jolly co-op adventures is certainly a good pitch.

A few weeks after the confirmation of its existence, Activision Blizzard announced the release date of the next Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II, in a tweet accompanied by a video showing off character art from the game.
#ModernWarfare2 Ships October 28th 💀 pic.twitter.com/OsgOspGh1j
May 24, 2022
The tweet reads, “#ModernWarfare2 ships October 28.” Get it? Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.
For a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.

While we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release. PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC are a shoo-in, but PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are likely, but questionable additions as we move forward in the console generation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has secured its release date along with a new cinematic trailer. 
Gollum’s video game solo outing launches September 1 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.


The game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. 
Gameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. 
We last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo. You can read our impressions of it from that time here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You don't get kicked out after 30 minutes anymore
The FFXIV inactivity timer is no more: for now, at least! Patch 6.11a has removed the feature that logged folks out after 30 minutes of not doing anything, now that the servers have stabilized since the release of Endwalker. Square Enix says this applies to all areas of the game, including the Firmament.
In what can be described as a minor patch, the team also alters job balance a bit, mixes up PVP matchmaking (in Crystalline Conflict "players in the Crystal tier can now be matched with players who are Diamond 3 (with 1 Rising Star) or higher"), and several bugs have been addressed, including the Paladin Requiescat glitch.
As a general rule, multiple jobs have been buffed in PVP to bring their performance up and allow for more party variety. Gunbreaker, Bard, Machinist, Dancer, Summoner, and Black Mage have gotten potency (damage) increases across the board; with the latter getting massive changes to multiple abilities (including cast time reductions and even added functionality). The Red Mage was nerfed a bit (only with the corps-a-corps ability, reducing its damage reduction from 20% to 10%).
The FFXIV inactivity timer is easily the biggest deal of the patch though. While 30 minutes is a decent chunk of time, it's not enough to go out to eat and come back! Sometimes, especially in a social situation like waiting to start a raid, it can be useful to stay logged in just to receive/eventually read messages from friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dat's not fay-rrrrreeee!
Warner Bros. Interactive's madcap brawler MultiVersus might only be in its pre-release stages, but already players and developers are noticing that some members of its colorful roster are just a little too handy with the ol' fisticuffs, and are currently on The List to receive a good old fashioned nerfing.
Responding to feedback from the game's recent closed alpha, MultiVersus director Tony Huynh has noted that four characters, in particular, seem to be dishing out far more doses of digital pain than others. First on the list is DC Comics' anti-hero Harley Quinn, who is joined by Adventure Time heroes Finn and Jake, and finally, Original MultiVersus Character Do Not Steal Reindog. Huynh notes that this quartet will receive larger "punish windows," which one would assume means that they will be easier to counter when they whiff their zany attacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvborgKG7fw
Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, and MultiVersus is likely to see a ton of adjustments as it progresses from Alpha to Beta, and from Beta to Launch. Alongside character balance updates, developer Player First Games will also be looking at fixing bugs, improving stability, tweaking matchmaking, and all other elements that make up the core essentials of any successful fighting game.
While MultiVersus is, admittedly, pushing into a ridiculously crowded market, the closed alpha has shown promise, even hooking in a party of non-fighting game players. It's a star-studded slapfest, that's for sure, and I'm looking forward to following the title's progression toward its eventual release, scheduled for later in 2022.
MultiVersus is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Did you check out this weekend's alpha? If so, then spill your thoughts in the comments, and be sure to check out our own CJ Andriessen's impressions right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[September 1, 2022
The Lord of the Rings Gollum game release date has been revealed, and one platform will be sitting things out for a bit.
So the beans have been spilled today: it's out on September 1 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Sadly, Switch users will have to wait for an indeterminate amount of time beyond that initial Gollum game release date, as that version has been delayed until "later this year."
I'm still really interested in the tricksy nature of the creation of this game from a macro standpoint. Adapting a Tolkien work is always difficult given that the action-based motifs of most video games weren't glorified in the source material: but playing as a villain (a conflicted one at that) could allow the development team to do some cool things with Gollum and the narrative.
That said, it'll be tough to balance the potential "stealth gameplay" (which is always hard to get right in the best of circumstances) and the aforementioned narrative elements: hopefully they're up to the task. The "partnership with Middle-earth Enterprises" (read: not the Tolkien Estate) could help with some oversight, though most of their input could be dictating what material the team does/doesn't have the rights for.

Ah, Mario... Where would we be without our favourite Italian plumber? Would Nintendo even exist now? Would the gaming industry exist? Would we exist? Would you? Heavens, we're getting a bit deep, now... Needless to say, the Super Mario Bros. series is fundamentally important to Nintendo and to the gaming industry at large.
Which Super Mario game is the best, though? Pitting the core titles against one another is like asking to choose your favourite pizza topping, or your favourite holiday destination, or your favourite episode of Seinfeld... It's a huge task, but thankfully, our lovely video producer Felix is here to run you through the top 14 Super Mario games of all time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft plugs away at long-awaited sequel
It has been literal years since we last saw anything of Ubisoft's long, long, long-awaited adventure title Beyond Good and Evil 2. In fact, the sequel to the 2003 action-adventure has gone so dark, that fans are already wondering whether the title is heading for an extended development of Dead Island 2 proportions.
However, it seems that the cyberpunkian project is both far from canned and equally far from completion. A new job listing from Ubisoft Barcelona sees the developer reaching out for a "Senior Gameplay Animator to jump on board with Jade and company, with the listing suggesting that Beyond Good and Evil 2 will be one of Ubisoft's "most ambitious games to date."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QgaMMuXzuo
It is believed that no less than five of Ubisoft's studios are currently working on the project, which has only seen a single cinematic trailer, released way back at E3 2018. While franchise creator Michel Ancel has now left the industry entirely, it seems that production on the purgatory follow-up is progressing. It's difficult to deny that, at this rate, fans may be better off simply holding off on their anticipation until Ubisoft finally has any in-game footage to share.
A Beyond Good and Evil cinematic adaptation is also currently in pre-production for the video-streaming service, Netflix. At this rate, we might be more likely to see the movie premiere before the game's sequel comes close to hitting the shelves.
Beyond Good and Evil 2 billed as ‘one of Ubisoft’s most ambitious games yet’ [VGC]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Sonic the Hedgehog 2 launched on Sega Genesis in 1992, it took the foundation laid with the Blue Blur's debut entry and expanded it in myriad ways. In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does literally every publisher need a stream? The answer is no
With E3 dead and buried for this year, it's all about Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest 2022, and whatever scattered streams decide to casually show up around it. Thankfully, there might be less of the latter in 2022.
Speaking on Twitter Spaces (as reported by VGC),  Keighley does what he does best: hype up his Summer Game Fest event. But this time he provides cold hard facts that actually highlight what this year's festival could look like, and things seem good in terms of making it actually feel E3-esque in 2022. Point blank, he explains:
"There were a lot of shows last year where everyone was disappointed when they weren’t really press conferences, right? Like Take-Two, Capcom, Square Enix and things like that...I think [they] have learned that if you’re going to do a press conference, you kind of need to have 30 minutes-plus of stuff, and sometimes they only have one or two great games to show, which may not be enough to do a full event around. So I think that’s going to be a bit of a shift. I have a pretty good sense of what’s coming in the next month, and I think people will be hyped about games in general."

It's kind of a bold statement in a way — noting that Summer Game Fest is bigger than, say, a Square Enix conference — but he's absolutely right about people being disappointed in general by smaller showcases; a reaction even companies like EA aren't immune to.
Now, we could still get a billion streams anyway, despite this claim. But this has me hopeful that at the very least, several publishers will "fold" into a bigger event, if only because they realized they can't cut it on their own in the past.

The long-awaited Lord of the Rings: Gollum from Daedalic Entertainment has been given a release date of September 1st, 2022 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Unfortunately however, it seems the Switch version needs a bit more time in the oven, with the press release stating that it is "planned for later this year".
Originally announced in March 2019, the game was due to arrive in 2021, but was subsequently delayed to 2022, with NACON joining forces with Daedalic Entertainment in order to "faithfully represent" the Lord of the Rings universe. Switch owners will need to wait a little bit longer, but likely only by a few months at the most.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

Streets of Rage 4 is arguably the greatest side-scrolling brawler ever made. At least that’s what I’ve been told.

Not only did SoR4 help revitalize a genre that once dominated the industry, but it also effectively tapped into the beat ‘em up’s roots as the precursor to the modern fighting game genre.
Upon its release in 2020, the game was showered with glowing reviews and strong sales, moving more than two and a half million copies in its first year on the market. In July of last year, Mr. X’s Nightmare DLC launched, adding more playable characters, including muscle mama Est…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blooming brilliant.
OPUS: Echo of Starsong is intimidating. Not so much in terms of difficulty — there's very little of that in what's largely a visual novel-esque sort of business — but in terms of story, there's so much to take in. Even with the preceding two games (OPUS: The Day We Found Earth and OPUS: Rocket of Whispers) in your back pocket, you're going to be thrown in at the deep end here. The world of OPUS is a shockingly well-realised one, rich with lore that stretches across in-game decades.
It's easily the most expansive title in the series, offering a number of different inputs in order to facilitate exploration of its world, taking control of multiple different characters across multiple years. What we're swinging at here is it's a lot, though it may not seem like such at the very beginning. Thrown into a world of space pirates, miners, witches and extensive politics, you're following the very intimate, very human story of the relationship between intergalactic traveller Jun, his guardian Kay, and enigmatic Witch Eda, among many others.

Krut: The Mythic Wings is based on the Thai animated film Krut: The Himmaphan Warriors, and the developers have aimed to recreate and represent the film and share Thai and Southeast Asian culture with the rest of the world.

        <updated>2022-05-24T12:24:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel Studios has released a new Thor: Love and Thunder trailer that runs more than two minutes long and features a ton of new footage, especially compared to the teaser trailer released last month. 
The new trailer features extended looks at scenes from the teaser, like when Thor realizes Jane Foster is back and now wielding Mjolnir. It also contains new footage of Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the villain of Taika Waititi’s latest Thor film, Gorr the God Butcher.


For comic fans, one look at Christian Bale’s Gorr, and it’s immediately apparent that this is a very different take. Gorr is typically more alien-looking but still humanoid. Bale’s Gorr looks very much like a human, and it’s not surprising because if you’re going to hire someone like Bale to play a villain, why not squeeze out as much as you can by reminding folks that this is Bale. 
However, regardless of where you fall on “he’s too human” or “I like it,” it’s hard to disagree that Bale’s Gorr is appropriately metal. Right off the bat, Gorr the God Butcher is an incredible title to hold if you’re a villain. Couple that with his first announcement – that all gods need to die, including Thor – and his design, which features black-tipped fingers, a planet-shattering weapon, and a black liquid that runs out of his mouth, and Gorr might be the most metal MCU villain yet. 

For more, watch the first Thor: Love and Thunder teaser trailer and then listen to this episode of From Panel To Podcast, which is Game Informer’s comic book podcast, to hear us talk about Thor: Love and Thunder.

        <updated>2022-05-24T12:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two, the publisher behind household name franchises like Grand Theft Auto, XCOM, and NBA2K, has officially acquired mobile juggernaut Zynga in the second-biggest deal in games history after Microsoft's eventual acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
According to PC Gamer, the proposals were approved last Thursday, and the acquisition totals a whopping $12.7 billion. Zynga is notable for its globally enjoyed small screen titles like Farmville and CSR Racing 2, the most popular mobile racing game. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick voiced his company's excitement about the deal, stating:
"We are thrilled to complete our combination with Zynga, which is a pivotal step to increase exponentially our Net Bookings from mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we bring together our exceptional talent, exciting pipelines of games, and industry-leading technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can take our portfolio to another level of creativity, innovation, and quality."
Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau responded in kind, "We are excited for Zynga's next-generation mobile platform, free-to-play expertise, diverse offering of games and incredible team to join the Take-Two family. We are eager to continue building an unparalleled portfolio of games that will reach broader markets and lead to continued growth for this next chapter of Zynga's history."
Perhaps we'll see more mobile ports or versions of Take-Two titles in the coming years. This deal comes hot off of financial reports that revealed the launch of more than 69 Take-Two games over the next three years. Only time will tell what fruit is born of this monumental merger. Acquisition culture is growing in the games industry. Sony recently hired a Corporate Development Director to spearhead growth opportunities through acquisitions, and Microsoft's Phil Spencer reiterated Xbox's commitment to buying studios that are "a good fit."

Pac-Man is currently celebrating its 42nd Anniversary, which is frankly insane when you really stop and think about it. As part of the celebration, Bandai Namco has teamed up with Epic Games to launch a Fortnite collaboration, due to kick off on June 2nd.
That's not all, though. An official theme song has been launched for the Pac-Man franchise, and we have to say, we absolutely love it. The song was written by Yoshihito Yano of Bandai Namco Studios Inc. and Kazuhito Udetsu of Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc., and performed by Tokyo-based artist Kaho Kidoguchi.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano's development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

The next season of Chocobo GP — Square Enix's answer to Mario Kart — is imminent. Following a delay of the start of season 2, Square Enix is now preparing to wave the chequered flag for the next set of changes.
In the biggest update since the game launched, version 1.1.0 is coming to Chocobo GP on 31st May and will be ringing in season 2 of the kart racer. The upcoming patch doesn't just prepare the game and tidy up bugs, however — two major additions will be allowing players of the Lite edition to play online, and the introduction of a brand new course in Balamb Garden, the iconic school from Final Fantasy VIII.

Chinese firm Aya Neo has already made something of a splash in the handheld gaming arena thanks to its Windows-based portables, but they've always been held back by the fact that they're so expensive, often costing over $1000.
However, the firm is expanding its lineup to include the Aya Neo Air, which will cost just CNY 4,399 (~US$649) when it launches later this year. That's still a big chunk of change, but that price point makes this a more realistic rival for the Switch – although it's worth noting that it's still more expensive than Valve's recently-released Steam Deck.

AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

Originally released in 2015, Touken Ranbu is a free-to-play browser game where players take up the role of a Saniwa who has the power to turn historical, mythical, and even a few imaginary swords into pretty boy warriors known as "Touken Danshi". The Danshi are mankind’s greatest weapon against the History Retrograde Army, a group of absurd-looking skeletal bugs that are traveling backward in time to change the course of history. As the Saniwa, it is up to you to protect the historical timeline by sending your Danshi back through previous eras of Japanese history to defeat them, even if it means restoring unquestionably cruel moments from the past.
The game was given an international release just last year, which is when I first became acquainted with it. But …]]></summary>

And now developer Flaming Fowl Studios and publisher Asmodee Digital have plans to release this digital version on consoles in 2023.
Asmodee is working with Saber Games and Embracer Group on this console port. No specific systems are known at this time, but Asmodee's tweet announcing this project shows an image of an Xbox controller. You can see it below along with a teaser video for the console versions:

When Tchia was announced at the Game Awards back in 2020, I immediately added it to my list of beautiful, relaxing games that I'm looking forward to. It's billed on Steam as a "tropical open-world adventure" which, as someone who loves all things sand and surf, is enough on its own to get me interested in learning more about the game. All of the other fun adventures the game promises, well, those are just icing on the cake.
Unfortunately, the game's developer Awaceb just announced that Tchia has been delayed to early 2023, so we're going to have to wait a little bit longer to embark on our tropical adventure. The good news is they did drop off a new mini-feature that highlights a key component of Tchia's gameplay: ocean exploration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQXFd4jn-mY
The short trailer shows clips of the titular character Tchia sailing around gorgeous tide pools, diving into the water in search of lost treasure, and even different customization options for the boat's sails and flags. Of all the open-world games I've played, Tchia looks to be the most relaxed and easy-going, which we can always use more of in an industry of titles focused so heavily on combat.
The news of the delay may not be ideal, but it does look like Tchia is going to be worth the wait. On top of the ocean exploration portion of the gameplay, we can also look forward to other fun mechanics like transforming into different animals and objects, climbing and gliding around the oceanside cliffs, and strumming on a fully playable ukulele.
We can definitely see the impact of titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey in Tchia, and I personally can't wait to see what new spin Awaceb puts on gameplay mechanics that we've come to know and love.
Tchia will be available in early 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

We first summed up Palworld as "Pokémon meets guns," and that line still rings true — but the more I see of this ridiculous survival crafting game with monster befriending (and butchering!), the more I think it's something I'd actually bother to play. After watching the new Palworld footage out of Indie Live Expo 2022, I'm becoming weirdly invested.
This isn't even a full minute-long clip, but it'll stick with you.

The Game Workers Alliance, a union of Raven Software quality assurance employees, has successfully voted to become officially recognized by Activision Blizzard. That makes them only the second formal union in the North American video game industry, following Video Games unionizing in December 2021, and the first within a major U.S. game publisher. 
According to the Washington Post, the Milwaukee branch of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) counted mailed-in ballots submitted by eligible Raven employees. Out of 22 ballots, 19 voted Yes, and 3 voted No. Parties have until May 31 to file an objection. If no one does, then the result becomes official.

I have a history with Total Recall on NES. Not only has it been frequently trashed by everyone I’ve ever looked up to, but it also soured my early retro gaming experience. We had an NES growing up, but my family sold it for an SNES while I was still too young to care. I reacquired one when I was a teenager and it came with potentially the worst assortment of games I could have started with: Kid Icarus, Castlevania 2, and Total Recall. It would be years later that Punch-Out!! and River City Ransom would teach me that not every game on the system would make me feel like peeling my skin off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The team becomes the first union at a major U.S. studio
Raven Software quality assurance workers have now officially voted to unionize. The final vote came down 19 for, 3 against.
The vote was held today, over a webcast stream. The group, Game Workers Alliance, marks the first union at a major games studio in North America and one of only a few around, including Vodeo Games staff.
https://twitter.com/WeAreGWA/status/1528825165798223872
It's a big move, especially as The Washington Post reported that Activision Blizzard management had been discouraging employees from voting in favor of the union. A Bloomberg report from earlier today says that the National Labor Relations Board is preparing an official complaint unless Activision settles. An Activision spokesperson denied the allegations in a statement to Bloomberg.
A long road
It's been a long road for Raven employees, starting with sudden layoffs at the end of last year. Workers at Raven's QA department, which works on titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, held a walkout and eventually went on strike calling for worker representation.
The strike ended when the QA testers formed a union, Game Workers Alliance, under the Communication Workers of America. The union called on Activision Blizzard for official recognition.
Activision Blizzard did recently confirm it would be moving many of its U.S. QA workers to full-time positions. But the company also said it would not voluntarily recognize Raven Software's QA union, leading to today's vote.
The publisher has been the subject of acute scrutiny for some time now. A lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing kickstarted a series of lawsuits and reports.
Microsoft announced earlier this year that it plans to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. Microsoft told The Washington Post earlier this year that it would "not stand in the way" of an Activision Blizzard union.

I wasn't sure what to make of V Rising in my first hour or so with it. The Steam Early Access survival game starts out just tasking you with making a vampire lord, rising from a coffin, and collecting resources. Crafting, scrapping, and surviving, it all felt familiar.
Yet the isometric world and grim, gothic setting kept giving me more and more Diablo vibes. Soon I had a castle and heart, some weapons and spells to work with, and a domain to call my own. And soon, I'd go on the hunt, and really see where V Rising would set itself apart for me. After putting in a handful of hours with V Rising over the weekend, I can absolutely see why players are so excited about its prospects.

As cloud gaming continues to build out, one service provider is now bundling streaming games in for its customers. AT&T announced today that Control Ultimate Edition is free to stream in its entirety to a phone, tablet, or computer for AT&T customers.
According to AT&T's site, you just need a postpaid mobility plan. Then you can head to its Play Now site using a mobile device or computer. Enter your phone number and zip code for your account, and bam, Control Ultimate Edition.
It's available for a limited time, and powered by Google's Immersive Stream for Games. That program is a spin-off of Stadia, where companies can license Google's Stadia streaming tech for their own streaming purposes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UISRDU_mzaw
This isn't the only game available, either. Batman: Arkham Knight is also on the program, as it launched last fall.
Cloudy future
Cloud gaming has been an interesting technology to watch develop over the years. Stadia itself went through some woes, shuttering its internal studios and looking to expand in other ways.
A report in February indicated Google might be pivoting and adapting the technology, bringing the tech to services looking for streaming options. It certainly seems like this Control offer falls under that.
Other companies have tried out their cloud tech, too. Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming has made Xbox One and Series X|S games open for streaming through the cloud.
For AT&T, it's a very specific subset of users able to take advantage of this. But it is interesting, as a microcosm of where these options could go: mobile. Cloud options already feel largely targeted towards phones, as they make for capable and widely available streaming platforms. With a pack-in like Control Ultimate Edition, it's certainly a step to watch for future streaming developments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just telling a friend that I would love to see a Lobo television show that draws inspiration from The Mandalorian and Deadpool. Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that's basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.
He's a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like "Ram Grenade Down Throat," "Blow Opponent in Half," and "Fire Hole Through Opponent." The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer's archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.
I doubt we'll ever see Lobo in a game, but there's a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects. Which DC hero do you think deserves a shot at a game next? Let us know in the comments section below.]]></summary>

Here are Game Informer, we loved Sonic The Hedgehog 2, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 and while 2022 is void of much competition in the video game adaptation space, save for Uncharted, it’s one of our favorite video game movies in a while. Sonic fans clearly showed up, too, because not only did Sonic The Hedgehog 2 score the best opening weekend for any video game movie ever, but it’s also the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the U.S. as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Logitech MX Master is an incredibly popular series of office mice, and today the latest MX Master 3 has dropped from its usual price of $100 to just $55 at Office Depot. That's a massive discount, achieved via a combination of an Office Depot price drop to $75, a 25% off code (SELFMADETECH) and a 30% back rewards code (90893995). 
This isn't the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

Although there are many (too many?) chances to get into Warhammer and 40K these days when it comes to video game adaptations, two upcoming titles, in particular, are really speaking to me: the first-person co-op game Darktide from Vermintide developer Fatshark, and Space Marine 2, a long-awaited action sequel. We'll see more of both of them shortly, as Games Workshop is putting together a Warhammer Skulls showcase on June 1.
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 are the showpiece games here — especially since they're new and they look cool — but the event will also cover the "latest updates and future plans" for some already released games, too. In its announcement, Games Workshop specifically pointed to Total War: Warhammer III, Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector, and Warhammer: Vermintide 2. We'll see what we get.
[caption id="attachment_323256" align="alignnone" width="1920"] That's a lot of logos![/caption]
When to show up
The Warhammer Skulls event will begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific on Wednesday, June 1, with "week-long offers" and new game content to follow. You can catch it live on Twitch.
Even if you're only interested in seeing a new trailer or two, you may want to swing by for the wider showcase — Clive Standen (of Vikings fame) will be involved. (If you missed it, he's Captain Titus in Space Marine 2.) Considering how quickly our summer calendar is filling up, though, I don't fault anyone for being a bit more choosy with their time.
Darktide isn't too far off with a September 13, 2022 release date, but Space Marine 2 feels much less tangible at this point — Saber Interactive is still listing a TBA launch.
I'm ready to cull the hordes in both of these games. Where are you at with them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fighting game fans and brawler fans rejoice! The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. 
The four sets respectively are:
Ryu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off
Chun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance
Guile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength
Ken Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect

The two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. 
“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.” 
This collection, which encompasses four SF vs. TMNT faceoffs, was created in celebration of Street Fighter’s 35th Anniversary, which is this year. 
What SF vs. TMNT matchups would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot Wheels Unleashed is getting some content soon featuring some looney new vehicles and tracks. In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.
A brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they're seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.
Hot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I'd assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.
The Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules. For more on Hot Wheels Unleashed, read our review of the racer here, and for more Looney Tunes nonsense, check out our preview and videos of MultiVersus.]]></summary>

If there is one thing I’ve learned from the current era of pop culture, it’s that I shouldn’t get too attached to the characters and stories that entertain me and bring me joy. Because, inevitably, this world will find a way to ruin everything that we love. Whether it’s turning cinema’s most magical moviegoing experience into one of the stupidest film franchises ever, or stripping away all meaning from a beloved character so you can endlessly monetize them, there are no depths companies and corporations won’t sink to if it means squeezing out a few more nickels from their fans and consumers.

2022 game streams are on the way, and I use "E3" in quotes because really, we all know it's E3 in spirit, even if E3 doesn't exist this year. I mean, the ESA made its bed, but it's still weird to call it by any other name at the current moment. It's kind of like Facebook changing the name of the Oculus Rift to something I won't even mention here. I'm just not ready for change!
In the meantime, here are all of the confirmed dates and times for 2022 game streams. It's...a lot. While "E3 is canceled," we're effectively getting a more spread out E3: with all the good and bad that comes with that.
Expect this page to be updated when new 2022 "E3" and Summer Game Fest streams arise.
When the Summer Games Fest stream starts
June 9 - 2PM ET
When the Netflix Gaming stream starts
June 10 - 1PM ET
When the Guerilla Collective stream starts
June 11 - 11AM ET
When the Wholesome Games Direct stream starts
June 11 - 12:30PM ET
When the Future Games Show stream starts
June 11 - 3PM ET
When the Xbox and Bethesda showcase stream starts
June 12 - 1PM ET
When the PC Gaming Show stream starts
June 12 - 3:30PM ET
Remember, EA Play Live 2022 has been canceled

When I booted up Citizen Sleeper for the first time, it immediately enthralled me with its premise. Its dystopian transhumanist pitch – surviving as a digitized consciousness of a human body implanted into a robot designed to work for a mega-corporation – is refreshing in the cyberpunk genre of games. Its slick, clean, and unique art style, coupled with its score, a Tycho-esque take on sci-fi beats, told me I was in for a good time, assuming the gameplay would click. And at first, I wasn't sure if it was going to because its early …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. 
Lost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. 


Before launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. 


At launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  
You can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game's price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every kid is a goddamn dork. Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

A look around the gaming landscape reveals exactly which one, too: PlayStation, the company with an exclusive Spider-Man franchise, and an upcoming Wolverine game. And over on the Xbox side, you won’t find any new Marvel games developed by an Xbox studio because according to Ong, the company declined Marvel’s offer, opting instead to focus on its own IP, as reported by Video Games Chronicle.

In less undeservedly romantic terms, it was the MMO’s newly added launcher that – unlike the rest of the game – didn’t work well at all with the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/23/two-more-classic-games-coming-to-ps-plus-accidentally-revealed"/>
        <updated>2022-05-23T12:27:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony unveiled its new and revamped PlayStation Plus service that combines Plus with PS Now back in March. Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. 
Funnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. 
As Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. 
Over on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  
While PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe's Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

Not that Battlefield 2042's website or digital store pages have been updated to reflect that change yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. 
Unlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!

In it, Chip and Dale deal with the realities of staying relevant in an industry that has changed significantly over the course of multiple decades. In one scene at a fan convention, the Rangers run into a familiar face that we never thought we'd actually see in a finished film, Ugly Sonic.
That's right, the version of Sonic the Hedgehog that caused the 2020 film to be delayed and re-modeled makes his triumphant return in Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers. Polygon spoke with Akiva Schaffer, the director of Chip 'n Dale, who said getting the rejected mascot likeness is one of h…]]></summary>

According to a report from Dylan Byers at Puck News, the merging of EA into NBC Universal was well in motion until the deal fell apart in April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The conclusion to the first season of Master Chief's TV adventures is finally here, but did it stick the landing or continue to frustrate us? Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we're reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.


The regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn't do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.
In episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee's decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that "Transcendence" has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.
When looking at the first season as a whole, it's clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.'s tale and whether or not we're excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.
Thank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we're so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. 
What do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.]]></summary>

Fueled Up is a four-player couch co-op game set in space announced last month and the first trailer had us convinced it would make for some chaotic, and great, co-op sessions. We couldn't help ourselves so we reached out to Fireline Games to ask if we could play it and they said yes. And now, today, you get to watch more than 20 minutes of our gameplay!


As you'll soon hear, not only did your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Alex Stadnik, get the chance to go hands-on with Fueled Up, they were joined by two of the devs from Fireline Games – Kacper Kowalczuk and Chris Heldt – to round out the four-person team. If you're wondering how we did so well playing Fueled Up, just know it's because Wesley and Alex are really good at video games and totally not because they had two people who actually created this game helping them. 
VIDEO
Enjoy this first look at Fueled Up gameplay on PC as Wesley and Alex ask them questions about the game, how the four-person development studio developed it, what they're hoping to add to the cooperative multiplayer space, and more. Be on the lookout for Fueled Up when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime this year. 
For more about Fueled Up, be sure to watch the reveal trailer from last month. For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for early looks at Diablo Immortal, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, MultiVersus, Bear And Breakfast, and more.

Tchia was first announced at the 2020 Game Awards and unfolds on a beautiful island inspired by New Caledonia. Players control a young girl with the magical ability to inhabit the bodies of animals as well as inanimate objects, such as coconuts. Exploration involves sailing to different tropical islands in an open ocean as well as climbing through forests and soaring across the landscape on a glider. The game last appeared at the 2021 Game Awards where it got a 2022 release window.

Developer Awaceb posted an update on Twitter explaining that it needs to delay the game to tinker on it further, saying in part “this extra time will allow us to really polish every aspect of the game and flesh out all the little details that we know will make Tchia a really special experience.” 
Tchia is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. You can catch up on every big game delayed to next year here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Stranding hit the PlayStation 4 back in 2019. Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. 
It seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. 
Death Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that.

        <updated>2022-05-20T14:44:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo announced in February that it plans to discontinue Wii U and 3DS eShop purchases in March 2023. However, the sunsetting process gradually rolls out throughout 2022. The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.
If you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  
Keep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. 
As a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”

For starters, the upcoming Disney Plus show, Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins next week and Disney and Fortnite have an extensive history of collaborating ahead of big releases like movies or TV shows. There’s also the fact that Obi-Wan’s lightsaber is already in Fortnite as it was one of four added to the game during its May the Fourth Star Wars Celebration period. 
Now, it’s official: the Jedi master is coming to Fortnite to find the high ground. More specifically, he’ll hit the Fortnite Item Shop on Thursday, May 26, at 8 p.m. ET. That’s just in time for his big Disney Plus show, which begins the next day. As for what to expect, here’s a look:

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TT Games’ Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga hit consoles and PC last month and since its release, it’s received two new character packs. Today, however, it received its first patch and after downloading it, you’ll find that there are 34 new Kyber Bricks to discover. 
While this is the first update for The Skywalker Saga, it is surprisingly a smaller one, bringing just a few fixes and a handful of Capital Ship encounters with it, as reported by Nintendo Everything.


Here’s a look at the full patch notes for this May 2022 update: 
Numerous fixes to stability, quality, progression and performance issues throughout the title, including fixes for:
Issue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.
Issue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.
Issue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.
Implemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:
Fulminatrix
Home One
Invisible Hand
Venator
As you can see, the patch fixes three issues that, if encountered, could stop your progression forward in the game. It also adds four new Capital Ship encounters to The Skywalker Saga, which includes with it 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect. 
While waiting for this patch to download, read Game Informer’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review, and then check out our guide of codes to unlock additional characters in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. Check out these awesome new Star Wars dioramas recently debuted by Lego after that.

The tweet reads, "Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus." The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called "An Explosive Start." A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name "Excellent work, Agent."
With the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q. Intelligent Cube, and Jumping Flash, though Syphon Filter is the only one on the list confirmed for trophy support.
PlayStation Plus' revamp adds two more pricing tiers with value-adds such as a downloadable game library and cloud streaming on compatible devices and PCs. You can read about the pricing and tier differences here. The new subscription tiers go live on June 13 in North America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June is fast approaching, and while there won’t be an E3, we’ll still get plenty of announcements thanks to a variety of summer gaming showcases. Most of them come out of Summer Game Fest, Geoff Keighley’s annual onslaught of livestreams and world premieres, but there are a few non-Keighley branded streams taking place as well. To help you get a grip on what’s going on and when, we’ve compiled all of the announced presentations with dates, times, and a brief description of what each entails. We'll update this list as more livestreams are announced.

Ryu’s new model looks very impressive, and wow, is he a wide dude. He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous. We have almost no information on the game as of now, but that won’t stop us from thinking about the possibilities of what may come with SF6 or what we want the next big chapter in the series to be.
Capcom is no stranger to live service games, nor do they lack experience in seasonal content. Street Fighter V had plenty of both, with four seasons of new characters, plenty of costumes, and new stages. N…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. 
Marvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. 


“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” 

At launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. 

Beginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. 
In regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more.

The delayed new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will be released in Q4 of 2022. 
Back in April, CD Projekt Red announced that it had taken the development of a new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in-house and that as a result of this shift, the update had been essentially indefinitely delayed. Following reports that the delay was in "development hell," CDPR put out a notice that this was not the case and now we know that the new-gen update will be released sometime in the final three months of this year.

Player First Games is well on its way to releasing its fighting game MultiVersus, a new multiplayer platform brawler that pits the extensive list of characters from the Warner Bros. catalog against one another in chaotic button-mashing battles. It's easy to compare MultiVersus to other fighting games in the genre, like Nintendo's juggernaut Super Smash Bros., but after spending a handful of hours throwing fists, kicks, and lasers with the WB crew, there's plenty that impressed me about MultiVersus that makes it stand out, and should be a game to …]]></summary>

I'd launch Windows 3.1 just to watch screensavers, marvelling at Mystify and staring at Starfield. How wonderful that our computer needed to dream as preventative medicine! I relived this today with a new collection of customisable 3D screensavers, watching shoals of fish, taking a road trip through a museum of global electricity pylons, watching housing estates rise and fall, and seeing so many swirly colours.

What games are funny? Why, and how? Is it easier for games to be funny when they're not trying to be? Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?

There is a difference, but you know it when you see it. Matthew's life is like a sitcom, and also we apologise to Henry Cavill for forgetting his birthday. Sorry Henry. Please come on the show.

Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. 
There’s already a starship's load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.

The game's first PvP beta drew to a close today, but we should find out what's next for the hero shooter at next month's event. The blog post doesn't give much away, all told, but according to the game's official Twitter account the event will include more details about its next PvP beta. Fingers crossed for an invite this time.

But this week, in the name of experimentation, I'm trying an approach that seems frankly inefficient. What if we... picked between two similar things? While I can't imagine many will think this good, let's give it a go, for science. Tell me, what's better: random critical hits, or controlled critical hits?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like "Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble," and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. 
To save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we've heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.
Barring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like "cops", "switch car" and "plan", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D gaming is… well, if not dead, then at best being kept in an iron lung by a teensy niche of enthusiasts. However, Acer will be making another attempt to take it semi-mainstream when it releases the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop in September 2022. Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.
This is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though.

Among the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.

Screenshots show what could be any other isometric RPG like Path Of Exile or something – anything.
So, you dive in expecting an average time. One characterised by little more than two palms on the knees once you've closed it down, then a big stand and a wordless stretch. But no! V Rising is the opposite of average; it should be renamed V-ERY GOOD Rising. Forget the art, the description, the screenshots. Just give it a shot.

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. 
Instead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wetlands, the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, is ready for public testing!
This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
