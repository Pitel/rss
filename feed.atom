        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 4 Life and Death expansion pack trailer gives Sims another shot at life with the latest haunting features. From funerals to the new Ravenwood neighborhood, there's plenty of spooktacular content to go around, perfect for its Halloween debut on Oct. 31, 2024. 


Right from the start, the reveal offers a tantalizing glimpse of a new clairvoyant feature: tarot cards. Your Sim will be able to peer into their future, trusting in the heart of the cards. But the one I'm most excited to see is the upcoming funeral event. It's a sentence I never thought I'd write, but in the Sims universe, the unexpected is always just around the corner.




This long-awaited mechanic finally allows you to set up a service after a death in the family. In its current version, these moments fall fairly flat,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of side quests in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and many of them give excellent rewards. Some are worth doing because they unlock further side quests, and the “One Soldier Too Many” side quest is one of these. 


Before you can begin this side quest, you’ll need to have completed the main story quest “Still Missing”, during which you clear the rift that has overtaken Hyrule Castle and rescue the King. 


Completing “One Soldier Too Many” and another side quest called “Impa’s Gift” will allow you to pick up a third side quest, “From the Heart”. This third side quest unlocks the Customary Attire outfit, so it’s worth working towards.

Anyone who has ventured into Carmine Forest eventually learns that regular blood spiders are aggressive creatures, with their queen being even stronger.


Where to find Queen Blood Spider in Throne and Liberty


There are two possible locations for the Queen Blood Spider in Throne and Liberty, both within the southern part of Carmine Forest. The first is just east of the main path, directly south of the forest's waypoint. Alternatively, you can head past both paths until you find another clearing she spawns in. 


Both will appear as small blue circles on your map if you have the Friend of Morokai the Turncoat quest active.

Footage of this mod has been circling the game's biggest subreddit for some time now, and it is slowly getting better and better.

        <updated>2024-10-03T15:00:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A release date has been set for Henry Hoare’s and Black-eye Priest’s latest horror game, Sniper Killer. It releases on October 17, 2024 for PC.


Sniper Killer has you alternate between two opposing roles. The first is the eponymous murderer who is tasked with taking out their targets from long range. The second is a detective who is investigating the murders and trying to stop the killer. It would really be too obvious if it turned out the detective and the killer are the same person, right? We’ll see.


Actually, from what I remember from the demo, it’s a journalism student investigating, but the new trailer says detective. It’s been over a year since the demo, so almost everything could have changed.




Sniper Killer comes from the horror development duo behind Bloodwash and Night at the Gates of Hell and Puppet Combo’s Torture Star Video publishing label. It follows the same seedy lo-fi look and feel, so there’ll be plenty of gore (and maybe a few tits), but it’ll all be charmingly low-poly and smudgy. A demo is still available, so you can try it out, but, as I mentioned, I don’t know how much has changed since then. I’ve been seeing development footage for quite a while now, and it seems like a lot of work has been done.


I’m excited. While I felt that Night at the Gates of Hell’s gratuitousness paled in comparison to the more grounded(ish) Bloodwash, both are pretty unique indie horror experiences. So, even if I’m not sure Sniper Killer will have the same thrills as Bloodwash, it’s at least going to be inventive. The fact that it seems like less of an action or slasher plot gets me curious enough.


Sniper Killer releases on PC on October 17, 2024.

The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

The Armory Pass is arguably the most significant addition in this update. Coming in at $15.99, this allows you to earn credits for each match you play, which can be spent on all the new cosmetics (which we'll get onto soon enough). It's essentially a battle pass, where you have a little more choice over your rewards.

You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie!
Much like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.
Are you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest daily build!

I am very enthusiastic. I actually named Into the Hive as my most anticipated game of 2024. Chicken Police: Paint it Red left a lasting impact on me when I played it (late) back in 2021 with its lovingly developed characters and interesting worldbuilding. Also, the photomanipulation used to create the characters and environments is practically hypnotic. Don’t let me oversell it, it’s a heavily narrative visual novel that can be slow and almost too detailed, but that’s part of what I love about it. Its creators are obviously very passionate abo…]]></summary>

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

Well here's a little sweetness to brighten up your Thursday, Mario has just nabbed the silver medal at the Olympics.
Okay, not quite. Firstly, this isn't Mario; it's Welsh plumber Ruben Duggan, who is jokingly referred to as "Super Mario" by his customers on account of his moustache (and, you know, the plumbing). Secondly, it's not the Olympics — at least, not those ones. This is the WorldSkills competition, known as "the skills Olympics," to those who take part, and it's a pretty big deal.

I play them all the time, and I have for most of my life, but I have no interest in the Gran Turismos of the world. Even Forza and The Crew are pushing it. It’s not really until you hit Burnout territory that you can get my attention.


But I especially love racing titles from the time before polygonal 3D took over. OutRun, Rad Mobile, the incredible Cool Riders: games that had to rely on graphical tricks and math to make their roads stretch to the horizon. One such method was Sega’s “Super Scaler” technique, which would stretch, shrink, and rotate sprites to make them look like they’re closer or further from the screen.

If you've been following the history of the FIFA series on Switch, you'll know there was a massive plot twist last year. After delivering exactly the same FIFA game for six years in a row and getting progressively more frustrated Nintendo Life reviews in the process, EA finally stepped up its game with EA Sports FC 24 and delivered, for the first time on Nintendo's console, full feature parity with all other versions of the game.
Now that this new honeymoon period for the series is over, does EA Sports FC 25 continue this bold new strategy of treating Switch owners as well as everyone else, or has EA gone back to its old ways and just delivered last year's game with updated rosters?

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Once the servers are up, you'll be able to witness some significant changes inside the game. NCSoft has taken feedback from the community, and the first post-launch patch includes some big changes. While most of the changes have been applied universally across all the platforms, few tweaks are exclusive to the Xbox and PlayStation consoles.


Throne and Liberty Update 1.1.0 All Platforms changes


Once you've access to Update 1.1.0, the UI should behave in a smoother fashion. Moreover, some of the pesky bugs that acted as hindrances have been squashed by the developers. 



Boss Effects: Mechanic markers should now appear more reliably under high visual effect counts.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The servers for Throne and Liberty are down at the time of writing as the developers prepare the client for Update 1.1.0.


This is the first major post-launch update, and it's available on PC and consoles. While the update is already available across all platforms, the servers continue to be out of order. Thankfully, NCSoft has already informed players of a potential timeline regarding when you'll be able to play once again.


When will the Throne and Liberty servers go live after Update 1.1.0?


The maintenance began as scheduled at 12:30 a.m. PT/3:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. UTC. According to the official notice, it is expected to last approximately six hours. If we assume that NCSoft will stick with that timeline, you can jump into Throne and Liberty at 6:30 a.m. PT/9:30 a.m. ET/1:30 p.m. UTC.




There's a chance that the maintenance could be extended at short notice. We have seen that happening in the past with games like Lost Ark, so a delay can't be ruled out yet. If there are no such delays, you should be able to play the latest MMO in about four hours since this article went live. If there are any delays, we will update the new timeline in this article.


The latest update includes some major changes across all platforms, much of which are targeted towards making the game a lot more stable. If the changes work as intended, the UI should feel smoother, and some of the errors you might have encountered till now should be resolved.


However, to test it out, we will have to wait at least a few more hours until NCSoft is done with its maintenance work.

Unlike some MMOs, Throne and Liberty's stats are not too many, which actually makes it easier for you to understand them. You'll want to level up the stats, which matter more for your build. While this is pretty obvious, always remember that the best stats for you will depend on what style of build you're running inside the game. Naturally, the optimum way is to level those stats up first to get the most out of your builds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're not playing with your friends and other players in Throne and Liberty, then what are you even doing!


A core experience of every MMO is to get together in adventures and share all the spoils. In Amazon Games' latest adventure, you can play with and against each other. The PvP scene is pretty near despite the early days, but you can simply concentrate on the PvE side of things. It's pretty fun to get together with your buddies to take down the strong bosses, and unlock unique rewards. To ease the process, you can either join a guild, or create one of your own.


How to create a guild in Throne and Liberty


While the easier job is just to join a guild, you can create one on your own as well.



Go to the main menu.


Select the Guild option.


Click on Create a Guild.


Choose your Guild Emblem, and you can also customize its looks.


Choose the name for your guild.


Once created, players can search for it and request to join. You can also share the details with your friends so that they can join.



Do note that you can't immediately create a guild after starting the game. You'll have to reach level 7 in order to make one (or join a guild).


How to join a guild in Throne and Liberty


If you don't want to create a guild, you can simply join one made by another player. As an alternative, you can also join a Party if you simply want to clear content, which is hard to do alone. Once you're level 7 or higher, go to the main menu.



Select the Guild function.


You can filter out your results using the available prerequisites.


Once you've found a guild, send a request to join.


Once your request is accepted, you'll be part of the guild.



Apart from joining guilds and parties, Throne and Liberty also has a matchmaking system for certain types of content. To access this feature, you'll need to reach player level 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korean publisher Krafton has confirmed that it signed a licensing agreement with Palworld developer, Pocketpair. The agreement will see PUBG: Battlegrounds developer, PUBG Studios, bring Palworld to mobile devices for the first time.


Touted as "Pokemon with guns" by fans, Palworld was a surprise gargantuan success upon its Early Access launch earlier this year. Few, least of all Pocketpair, could have seen its eyewatering sales figures coming, as it stormed to the top of the charts on PC and Xbox consoles at the start of 2024.

Player counts have dropped in the months since, although a recent PlayStation 5 release has helped bring new fans into the fold. Nintendo and The Pokemon Company suing Pocketpair has also played a part in keeping Palworld in the news cycle of late.


Krafton confirmed Palworld's upcoming mobile port in a statement on its website, with its subsidiary PUBG Studios moving forward on the project. The announcement gave no release window for Palworld on Android and iOS, although it did confirm it "plans to faithfully reinterpret and implement the original’s main fun elements to fit the mobile environment." Whether this results in any significant gameplay changes remains to be seen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast now has complete control over their card game's most popular format. Some might be surprised to learn that Magic: The Gathering's most popular and beloved format, Commander, was not already overseen by the card game's owners. The answer, in short, is that the format wasn't for Wizards. Commander is for everyone. 


Commander was born from Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH) format on an air force base in Alaska. A Magic Judge named Sheldon Menery started to shape this format in the early 2000s around the idea of a social, player-driven philosophy. Sheldon founded the Commander Rules Committee (RC) to help guide the format down these hopeful paths. The intention of the RC has always been to encourage the social, casual nature of Commander, rather than enforce strict rulesets.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titmouse, the animation studio behind Metalocalypse and partners on The Legend of Vox Machina, has announced that they are launching a Kickstarter campaign to create their own tabletop roleplaying game. 


Drunkards, Druggies & Delinquents is a little different from the usual dice-throwing fare. Players will experience typical tabletop tropes, adventuring as wizards and fighters to take on demons and monsters like Meat Man. However, the game also encourages players to drink and consume as they take damage or complete quests and adventures.

As Titmouse themselves say on their Backerkit page, "the game is suited to players with a thirst for glory… and beer!" The campaign will launch on October 8 with fulfilment expected by Spring 2025, when the production company celeb…]]></summary>

Let's look into the differences between the two modes and help players choose the one most suiting of their playstyle.


What is Classic Mode in Throne and Liberty


As the name suggests, it's the mode more in line with the camera controls you'd find in other ARPGs. While you use the WASD keys to move your character, the camera remains locked in an angle at all times until the player uses the mouse to click and drag it around. The camera will once again become locked to where it was when the player stops dragging it around.

One of the important aspects of doing so is acquiring your Domain Expansion and getting a new powerful move. Here is how to get Domain Expansion in Sorcery Roblox.





How to get Domain Expansion


To get Domain Expansion in Sorcery, you'll need to have unlocked the ability to Meditate and also need a Void Key. It's random when you unlock Meditate, but you can get it any time after Level 90. You can Meditate by hitting the 'M' key, and Void Keys can be acquired by completing missions. Head to the big locked gate that normally tells you "I Need a Key". As long as you have a Void Key, you can unlock this gate and head inside.

The Slumber Dojo can be found in Kakariko Village, which can itself be found northwest of Hyrule Castle Town. It's accessible right from the very start of a playthrough, but I'd recommend building up a strong stock of Echoes before you take on the challenges within. 


Caromadillos are, as the name suggests, armadillo-like creatures who curl into a ball and repeatedly attack you by bouncing off of the walls like a three-year-old with a sugar rush. As such, this challenge could very quickly go south if they're all taking aim at you, but t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter if you are playing on consoles or PC, nothing will be more handy in Throne and Liberty than the ability to auto run, as doing it will allow you to take a break while still making your way to your destination. 


But how exactly can you do that in the game? Here's how to auto run in Throne and Liberty, no matter your platform of choice.


How to Auto Run in Throne and Liberty on both consoles and PC


You can auto run in Throne and Liberty when playing with a controller by opening your Quick Menu —hold L2/LT— and then selecting Move Constantly. PC players using a mouse and keyboard can also trigger the action by simply pressing "/". You can also set a keybind to the action on consoles, as well as change the default one on PC by doing the following: 



How to change your auto run keybind on PC

Head to Settings


Go to Shotcuts and then to Character


Scroll down until you spot Move Constantly


Click to reassign your keybind. 






How to assign an auto run shortcut on consoles (PS5 and Xbox)

Head to Settings


Open the Controller tab and then select Custom under Presets.


Scroll down until you spot Move Constantly.


Assign your desired input/input combination to the action.

Keep in mind that once auto running, you will be able to direct your character by moving your camera, as well as cancel the action by either performing a movement input or interacting with anything. To make sure you will be able to sharp turns, I recommend adjusting your Camera Sensitively, a feat you can do by heading to Gameplay and then to Camera.

It's just accepted wisdom these days that Zelda: A Link to the Past is one of the best entries in the entire Zelda canon.
This 16-bit classic updated the Zelda formula in amazing ways, offering a large and expansive game world packed with unique enemies and tricky dungeons. Later ported to the GBA, it remains one of the best video games in Nintendo's locker – but, like any game, it stands to reason that it wasn't going to be to everybody's tastes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

In case you haven’t heard, Hironobu Sakaguchi, the father of Final Fantasy, is returning home to Square Enix, so to speak, for the first time in 21 years, bringing Mistwalker’s one-time Apple Arcade-exclusive RPG Fantasian to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 (both physically and digitally) and to PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam (digitally) on December 5, 2024, in the form of Fantasian Neo Dimension.
To investigate more about his latest effort, which was first announced in 2018 and released three years later, Nintendo Life met up with Sakaguchi-san a few weeks ago (before the birth of his grandchild!) in Los Angeles to discuss his newest game’s second life, and whether it would be his final Fantasian.

Naturally, these speedruns showcase the game's final dungeon and boss, so we'd only recommend watching if you don't mind some pretty intense spoilers.

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me.

Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-running chief of the Tekken series, Katsuhiro Harada, once tried to convince KFC to let him use Colonel Sanders as a character in the fighting game, according to an interview with TheGamer. "[They] weren't very open to the idea," added game designer Michael Murray, who sat in on the interview. "[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."
Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into Tekken 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway.

Paying the academic price is funny if you say it like paying the iron price. Although, again, not quite funny enough to soothe my awful uni flashbacks of books that cost a week’s worth of groceries each.

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As befits the “very normal gardening game” that puzzly mystery box Grunn winkingly bills itself as, the first tool I obtained was a pair of shears. The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

So I tried out the demo for its sequel, System Purge: Hollow Point, and can confirm that the witch still has a nice hop. I'm thankful for this, because if the witch did not have a nice hop, the game would be maddening in a bad way. Don't get me wrong, it's still maddening. Just in a good way. The hop is good.

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bravely he stood, alone on his hill, unwavering in the face of backlash: Chrono Trigger should have just let Frog be a talking frog instead of being a knight turned into a frog. So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called Threads Of Time, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful. Hop on over to the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

Horace got burnt by a dodgy coffee maker once, had to regrow a few limbs, it’s a whole thing, the bear doesn’t like talking about it, etc. Anyway, rules are like Horace’s arms: they’re meant to be stretched, and also made of bear. MÖRK BORG Heresy Supreme is a grotty cheese dream of a 2D action game based on the popular tabletop RPG MÖRK BORG - a book so nice to just have on your shelf that I’m not even mad I accidentally bought a copy in Swedish. It’s fine. Makes it more metal.

It’s going to great! “What’s that, eh?!” I’ll say, pointing to a Doshaguma in a manner that might foolishly suggest I expect her to give a damn. “Mraow”, she’ll reply, knock over my coffee, then go back to sleep. “It’s you!” I’ll exclaim, pointing to the Palico I’ve spent six hours making look just like her. “That looks nothing like me, you odorous lummox,” she’ll insinuate with a cocked eyebrow, then go shout at an ant for a bit.
Ah well, at least I have videogames - this one is out on the 28th of Febwar, 2025. Here’s a trailer from last night’s Sony-me-doo:

Now here's Moon Watch, a Vampire Survivors-ish pixelart shooter in which you have a watch that stops time when you stand still. Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets.

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".

This rare roguelike distils the genre down to its purest components, all in favour of amplifying its dizzying combat that plays gracefully with the concepts of positioning and patience. Highly refined, stylish and complex, Shogun Showdown is a delight.

It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.

If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Crimson Desert dropped that audacious trailer at Gamescom 2023, I’ve yearned to soak in its medieval Just Cause 2 vibes. It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!
I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out "It’s just a demo" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When playing a new Soulslike, there’s an element of translation involved while you figure out the language of the game. What are the upgrade materials called? What’s the equivalent of poison? What are experience points and checkpoints called, although you’re going to call them souls and bonfires anyway? I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave. Enotria: The Last Song’s arcane Soulslike language is actually just Italian.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-review"/>
        <updated>2024-09-23T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoilers throughout. TLDR: fun, generous, beautiful animation and cinematography. Worked mostly fine on my PC. I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. 
Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

Potenciálně dojemná patnáctiminutová hříčka, která byla zcela nesmyslně natažena na 90 minut, následkem čehož se její rozvleklost téměř nedá fyzicky vydržet. (Ilča 5 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Po svěžích "Chudáčcích" je tohle návrat k intelektuální artovosti "Humra" nebo "Posvátného jelena".

Mírným pozitivem je, že to jsou tři oddělené minipříběhy (se stejnými herci) a ne jeden dlouhý. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
