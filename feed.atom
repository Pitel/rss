        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Ops 6 revolutionizes classic loadouts with the introduction of the convenient Dedicated Melee system. This innovative mechanic makes it a breeze to wield your tools, permitting you to use them at any moment. 


We'll show you how to use a Melee weapon in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to guide you through this new tactic.


Black Ops 6 Dedicated Melee guide


In Black Ops 6, you can equip your knife by holding the 'V' key on PC or pressing the right thumbstick for controllers. This differs from past entries like Modern Warfare 3, where Melees usually occupied the Secondary Weapon section. With the full launch of BO6, a third slot is now designated for the more compact weapons, giving you a total of three tools in your arsenal.

If you've performed Finishing Moves in the past, the Melee interaction utilizes the same button and process. The only difference is that Finishing Moves requires an enemy Operator close by, similar to the returning Body Shield feature. So, as long as nobody is around you, you can freely equip your Melee weapon. You'll also activate unlimited Tac Sprint while holding this tool, allowing you to travel more efficiently.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Keep in mind that the standard 'Switch Weapon' interaction does not work for Melee weapons. However, you can use it to swap out your knives for your Primary and Secondary.


The Baseball Bat and Knife are the only two tools available in the Melee Weapon category. The Knife unlocks automatically, while the Baseball Bat requires a Level 52 rank. There will likely be more Melee Weapons in the near future, so stay tuned for more variety in the upcoming seasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Ops Cold War's Body Shield returns in Black Ops 6, allowing you to give a nice hug to your opponents. The tactic offers many advantages by safely guarding you from enemy gunfire. We'll show you how to use Body Shield in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.


How to perform Body Shield in Black Ops 6


To use Body Shield in Black Ops 6, sneak up behind an enemy and double-tap the Melee button. The interaction appears when you're close to the opponent, which will also display a prompt for a Finishing Move (holding the button instead). It'll be tricky to do with all the chaos going around, so it may take a few tries to master.


Screenshot by Destructoid


I find it best to perform the Body Shield while holding a Melee weapon, as it helps you move around faster. Some maps also have more hiding spots for you to use, including the train yard in Derelict. Then, once you complete it, you'll temporarily gain control of the opponent with the free range to move around. Look out for the meter at the center of the screen to determine how long the shield will last. It goes by quickly, and the "victim" can even call for help to cut it short. Just try to take advantage of the shield while you can and shoot down anyone in your way.


Screenshot by Destructoid


When the Body Shield victim has done their part, you'll have the option to Quick Kill or Execute (Finishing Move) them. But if you want to keep the fun going, you can use BO6 voice chat with them to whisper some sweet nothings in their ears.

How do you Exfil in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies?


To Exfil in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies, you must wait until its corresponding notification appears during a specific round. The first time it spawns is during Round 11, so you'll need to survive until then. 


I've also noticed that it spawns around Rounds 16 and 21. There will likely be even more opportunities, but I'm still working my way through Zombies mode. No matter what, Exfils will always be available during the rounds mentioned above for both the Liberty Falls and Te…]]></summary>

How to get the Keycard


Screenshot by Destructoid


The key to the display case sits in the librarian's office. The door to the office is to the right of the display case, however this door is also locked. To open the door to the office you'll need a keycard.


From the office door, turn around and walk towards the front desk. Head towards the left side of the desk, near the printers, and crouch to get behind the front desk counter. The keycards are inside a box under the computers.


How to get the Display Key

Take this key card back to the locked door and put it in the keycard reader. In the librarian's office, turn right and pick up the Display Key on the desk near the note. Be sure to also grab the inhaler on the bookshelf, it's not necessary to open the Display Case, but it's worth having another healing item.


Use the Display Key on the Display Case and the spirit board is all yours. Now you need to find Amy, turn around, and run straight into the Non-Fiction section of the library. Take a left at the smaller bookshelves near the memorial into the Fiction section. 


Amy will be sitting at a table near the windows. Sit down at the table and Amy will happily guide you into the world of the supernatural.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once Human brought a new ‘Temperature’ mechanic in their new Way of the Winter update. In this update, you have to face harsh cold, and hot weather in the northern region of Nalcott Island. The point of this mechanic is to make survival a bit difficult for you. 


So, to help you understand this mechanic more, here is an article on everything you need to know about the new 'Temperature’ mechanic in Once Human. 


What is the Temperature mechanic in Once Human?




With the new introduction of the Temperature mechanic, you will experience both hot and cold weather in Once Human. Not only that, you are not just affected by the weather but also any environmental items that can influence the temperature around it. Let’s say if you are holding a torch or a Molotov Cocktail, you will start feeling hotter. Not just with the things; if you are near ice, you will feel cold, and if you are near lava, you will feel hot. 


To help you resist the weather, you can equip heat-resistant and cold-resistant gear to survive the temperature. You can also grow Spikematoes, Polar Peppers, and Sunny Ginger crops, as using them can help you tackle the cold weather.


The Way of the Winter update in Once Human also brings a new building called Thermal Tower, which lets you control the temperature around you. Plus, it also lets you increase the crop yield and speed up the production facilities. However, you have to defend this tower from the Colossal Chaosweavers.

Yet like a lot of people, I also use these betas to help determine whether I'll enjoy the final product. I approach these cautiously as some issues are part of the beta experience, but it's a great way to judge whether the core experience is for me.

Now, for the first time since 2016, Batman has returned to VR with Arkham Shadow. I won't leave you in suspense! Things turned out pretty well this time.

Batman: Arkham Shadow (Quest 3 [reviewed], Quest 3S)

I got early access to the demo, and I’m going to be honest: it’s not for me. That’s not a gentle way of saying it sucks; it’s just not my kind of game. It doesn’t gel with me. It’s not the sort of thing I find appealing. That’s it. I’m not referring to its quality.


On the surface, it kind of looks like my thing. It’s an OS Sim, sort of like Hypnospace Outlaw or The Operator. It revolves around this unfinished piece of software known only as untitled.exe.

Most gamers believed that Ubisoft cancelled Beyond Good & Evil 2, especially after the game's Creative Director, Emile Morel, sadly passed away in June 2023. But, in reality, this hasn't stopped the company from continuing to pursue this ambitious project, and the company has now assigned a new person to the role: Fawzi Mesmar, who announced it on his personal LinkedIn page.

All block moves in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero


There are three different kinds of blocks in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero. The right shoulder button (R1/RB) by itself is your standard block for most attacks. However, you'll need to guard against positional strikes too. If your opponent is trying to pull off an overhead attack, hold the right shoulder button and move your left analog stick up. If your foe sweeps your feet, hold the right shoulder button and move the left analog stick down. It's sometimes hard to detec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will keep you sailing the high seas far longer than expected. The game will have a lengthier story campaign than Like a Dragon Gaiden, as confirmed by its developer.


The news was revealed in an interview between Ryu Ga Gotoku boss Masayoshi Yokoyama and Famitsu. As translated by GameRant, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's story will be "1.3 - 1.5 times" longer than that of Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. Gaiden's story was about 12 hours on average, so we're looking at an increase of about 3.6 to 6 hours. Math!





Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will boast a longer voyage than expected


Remember that this is for the story, not the entire swashbuckling experience. As most games in the series also contain heaps of side content, Pirate Yakuza should be able to hold your attention for much longer. Hell, even LaD Gaiden could keep you locked in for around 30 hours depending on how much of the game you chose to explore. It included dozens of side missions and a Coliseum, where you could spend many hours recruiting fighters and winning events in a rough-and-tumble blood sport. 




Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off that takes place after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the eighth mainline game in the series. It'll likely fill in some gaps between the game and Like a Dragon 9, or at the very least give us a wacky misadventure starring Majima. Some prior allies do appear in some form or another, so it won't be the boggle-eyed lunatic sailing alone without any familiar faces. Either way, it could make for an exciting time with plenty of action and sailing. The game launches on February 21, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive has confirmed that Public Test Servers are to be added to the game in a future update. 


In a message spearheaded by Game Director Dmitriy Grigorenko, it was confirmed that this will allow players to "try out major balancing updates and make your voices heard before they are pushed onto public branches."


Space Marine 2 rolls back balance changes, Public Test Servers confirmed


Last week, Space Marine 2 released its 4.0 patch, and to say players weren't happy is an understatement. Unpopular weapon nerfs and a higher difficulty curve all around had gamers up in arms, leading some to take to the virtual streets in a form of protest as old as time: Steam review bombing.

Space Marine 2 fans can officially put down their pitchforks; the new 4.1 update to the game rolls back those controversial changes, with Grigorenko claiming he "forgot that once the game comes out, it's no longer a dev's game. It's yours first and foremost."


To avoid repeating the mistake with future balance updates, Saber Interactive confirmed that the aforementioned Public Test Servers will be coming to Space Marine 2 in "early 2025." However, no further timeline has been given for this as of yet.

The latest Japanese charts are in, courtesy of Famitsu, and as expected, Super Mario Party Jamboree has taken the region by storm, selling an impressive 227,569 units at launch. Remember these charts only account for boxed copies too, so digital sales will drive the total number up nicely.
It's a solid week for the PlayStation 5, mind, with Professional Baseball Spirits 2024-2025 coming in second place with 69,078 units sold, while Metaphor: ReFantazio finds representation on both the PS4 and PS5 in the top ten.

Keepsakes are items that grant things like passive buffs and are offered by some NPCs in Hades 2. They can be equipped before a run and can be swapped between Regions after activating the necessary incantation. Each Keepsake can be leveled up in rarity twice, making them even more powerful.

How to Change Weapons


By default, the key to change Weapons in Factorio Space Age is the 'C' key. This will automatically cycle to the next equipped weapon, based on your weapons shown in the bottom left corner of the screen on your tool belt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zotac are one of the better graphics card makers of the post-EVGA era, so even as the early pangs of handheld gaming PC fatigue start to creep in, I’ve been keeping a hopeful eye on the Zotac Zone. This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

Digital Eclipse's excellent Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition launched on Switch last month and we loved it. This is already a pretty beefy package with all Armageddon game modes, the studio's usual museum content and access to a Game Boy Color version, but it's about to get even bigger.
Publisher Team17 today revealed that three more games will be blasting into the Switch remaster at some point in "early 2025". Both the NES' and Mega Drive/Genesis' Worms will arrive alongside the GBA's Worms Party in the upcoming content update, putting this Anniversary Edition closer to an 'Anniversary Collection' than we'd initially expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a drag-on.
Open-world games have evolved a lot in the 19 years since the original Yakuza was released. Quirky fetch quests and meandering storytelling were often characteristics of the genre, as was the sense that the developers were gleefully mashing together ideas and holding everything together with an offbeat sense of humour. It’s a positive, then, that this 2017 remake, Yakuza Kiwami, now released on the Switch, updated and modernised much of the 2005 original, so much so that they’re effectively two distinct games.
For example, the remake completely overhauls the original’s fixed-perspective, Resident Evil-style Tokyo streets. The 2005 game featured just one combat style, while the remake has four — Rush, Brawler, Beast, and Dragon — a development first seen in a similar way in the much-superior 2015 prequel Yakuza 0. The game’s story was also significantly fleshed out by developing an important subplot concerning the game’s tragic antagonist, Nishiki.

It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe.

Using the New Zealand trick, it's possible to play earlier than normal, so if you're interested in the possibility, here's how you can perform it.


How to use the New Zealand Trick for CoD Black Ops 6


The "New Zealand trick" is well-known in the COD community and has even worked for other unrelated games in the past. This method takes advantage of modern gaming's staggered release schedules, which often roll out based on time zones. In theory, if you could temporarily set your location to New Zealand, you might unlock early access to Black Ops 6 before its official release in other regions. That’s the core idea behind this trick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wolf Among Us 2 has been listed as "Coming Soon" on its Epic Games Store page for so long that it's not surprising folks are getting noticeably concerned over it. Following a recent rumor that it got dusted, Telltale had to confirm that it's (yes) still in development.


The rumor apparently began on a Reddit thread, where a supposed whistleblower reported that the game was on the brink of cancellation. They wrote that The Wolf Among Us 2 was "at a critical point"  and Telltale may have "no choice but to shelve it."

Development on The Wolf Among Us 2 'continues', confirms Telltale


As the rumor grew wings, developer Telltale Games had to step in. Speaking to Eurogamer, the company confirmed that development on The Wolf Among Us 2 "continues" and that more will be revealed later.


"As a rule, we don't comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads," a Telltale Games rep told Eurogamer. "But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we're excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right."


Image via Telltale Games


The reply should be enough to satiate fans of the troubled series for now, although rumors like this tend to crop up during times of uncertainty for games long in development. Bigby Wolf's next adventure has been cooking for a long time, even before Telltale shut its doors in 2018. The developer made a surprising comeback in 2019 and announced that the game is still on the way. It was delayed from 2023 to this year, however, and we haven't seen hide nor hair of the wolf man. 


Hopefully, we'll hear more about a possible release date soon. I need more Bigby in my life, as do we all.

Playtonic Games has officially unveiled the confirmed platforms for its upcoming remaster of Yooka-Laylee, dubbed Yooka-Replaylee.
Curiously, Switch isn't mentioned by name, with Playtonic instead confirming a release on 'Nintendo Platforms'. Now, this could mean a couple of things: it's either a blanket way of referring to the Switch family of systems, or it's referencing Nintendo's upcoming new hardware.

We all know the Switch 2 is coming. We all know it's going to be revealed at some point before the end of the current financial year (March 2025). But what happens to the humble Switch when its successor eventually releases? Will Nintendo just let it die?
No, of course not. With the console nearing 150 million units sold since its release in 2017, Nintendo will want to keep supporting the device for those not particularly keen on upgrading for the time being. However, according to YouTuber tvPH (known as 'Brazil' on resetera), the company will likely lean heavily on third-party support while its first-party studios largely migrate over to the Switch 2.

Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children?

Wilmot's Warehouse felt like that joke made manifest, putting you in the shoes of a tiny warehouse working squareboi.

It's an abbreviated but generous display of equatorial exotica and vaguely prehistoric wildlife, home to such key verbs as "exploration", "village-building", "gardening", "creature-nurturing" and "murdering megasloths with a lump of wood". And look at that, there's a release date perched on top - 19th November 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week or so, you may have caught wind of Denuvo  - the makers of anti-cheat and anti-piracy software  - embarking on a PR campaign of sorts, intended to combat negative public perception of their software. In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. 
Denuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. 
RPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered". What claims are you referring to?
Andreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.

Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was little, I really liked what I saw of Shin chan, even if it was just largely flashes of his bare arse on Japanese TV. He seemed mischievous, a bit of a menace, and part of a fun family dynamic. Flash forward to now and I can only describe the lad as… jarring. At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.
And I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I forgot about just-launched horror game Tormenture when ravelling together this week's round-up of potent PC releases, but thankfully, Maw disciple Fachewachewa was on my case in the comments. It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.
It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.
"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game," developer Raphael Bossniak admits.
And yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.

Original story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: "{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.

It's a stalking game in which you are the person stalking you and also, you are the person being stalked. By you. Yes, I too am wearing an expression of puppy-eyed dismay and confusion. But it sounds interesting, sufficiently interesting that I can disregard the very loud DYSTOPIAN WORLD framing in the trailer.

Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding "generational leaps" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is "only incrementally better", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.

With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour!

In the wake of last night's trailer, store pages have gone live on Steam, Epic Games Store and Xbox, shedding a bit more light upon the aquatic monster's nature and in particular, how it will evolve before the 1.0 release.

It's all because you are, um, wanting to find a special rift in the future, so you can go back to a special version of the past. I think. Anyway yeah, it looks kinda fine to good.

Ah well, circle of life and all that. Plus, at least it’s thematic: you’ll have to make sacrifices yourself if you want to progress across its unforgiving deserts. This one’s got shades of roguelite, RPG, strategy, and turn-based tactics. Nothing too uncommon, but it’s the shades of Red Faction, Frostpunk, and Sunless Sea that have me interested.

The CJEU judgment holds that there was no violation of Sony's rights, since Action Replay ran alongside Sony's game code, only modifying values in RAM while leaving object code untouched.

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy have released the first proper in-game trailer for Alan Wake 2's second expansion, The Lake House. It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent chat with the Ian Games Network, IO Interactive boss Hakan Abrak said the Hitman developer "absolutely feel(s) like 20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy, creating an agent that travels the world and globetrotting whatnot, has given us some know-how" on bringing James Bond to the greasy screen ("greasy screen" is my new attempt at coining a "the big/small screen" but for games. I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leadership at Don’t Nod yesterday “presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies,” via financials report, in response to "a balance sheet that highlights the need to secure the company's resources" following the underperformance of Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden.
In plain terms, this means that up to 69 workers at the French company are at risk of layoffs due to an 11% year-on-year decline in operating revenue, via IGN. The number represents "29% of the Paris studio workforce", say the STJV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I punched a cultist in the face in Streets Of Rogue 2, just because. He started running away - something I would not allow. When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space RPG Exodus was announced back in December, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.
Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

Still, the pipe won’t last forever - this is videogame steel, the crumbliest steel there is. Thank god No More Room In Hell 2 doesn’t bother with the hunger or rest parts of the survival equation.

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

Ah yes, this is it, that sense of unpleasantly intimate sheepishness. That's the withering late-90s chatbox scorn I've been missing, in this age of glossy live service multiplayer. I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.
It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

Balancing shooters in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The allure of the sea-green GameBoy screen is difficult to resist. Picking up from where Pokémon left off two decades ago, Letalis is a bleepy-bloopy retro RPG about wandering from town to town and doing battle with dodgy local leaders to prove your worth. But you won't be doing the fighting yourself, God no. Leave that to the squad of Roman gladiators hiding in your back pocket.

FATHER TO NO MURDERED SONS. HUSBAND OF NO MURDERED WIVES. OWNER OF A BRONZE SWIMMING CERTIFICATE AND A WHITE BELT IN KARATE. Eater of pizza that has fallen on the floor, like a whole minute ago! And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. Hah, it's much easier to make that last claim in a video game, rather than when standing in a literal circle of swords. The game in question is Dieseldome: Oil And Blood, and it is pretty good fun. There's a demo on Steam, for now is the time of Next Fest.

This is why I like the demo for first-person shooter Cop Bastard a lot. It's set in early 90s Japan, where you'll smoke fools with guns in straightforward homage to 90s action movies. And it has an updated demo - not officially part of the latest Steam Next Fest - out right now.

The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

You are the lone engineer on a rustbucket submarine exploring the dangerous waters of a submerged country in an alternate reality 1990s. The warning lights on the control panel are flashing, a buzzer is spluttering like a dying bluebottle, and your robotic assistant is about as useful as an umbrella in the Mariana Trench. Things could not get any worse. And then you see it. Something in the green haze outside. Something with a tail.

Or at least, a proper list of known bugs on day one, to preempt any compilations created by vengeful players? Skyrim Lead Designer and Starfield Systems Designer Bruce Nesmith has spoken a little about the “interesting problem” of how open developers should be about technical issues on day one, given the expectation some players have that every game should be "flawless".
When asked by Videogamer if lists of known bugs (Nesmith throws out ‘700’ as an example for Skyrim) should be shared with fans on launch "to temper expectations," he responded:

Hundreds of domains with similar branding are scooping up millions of visitors, but who operates them and from where, is currently unknown.

Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti. "So when we stumbled into Mörk Borg, and then we started to play, we looked at each other in the eyes and said, 'Why don't we make a game out of it?'"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most important lessons in skiing is, presumably, to look where you're going. You wouldn't want to ski with your eyes closed or while viewing yourself from a drone pointed back at the mountain from above. That'd be daft.

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normal games for normal people, that's what everyone loves. Cosy experiences where nothing goes wrong and you have absolutely zero things to investigate and no otherworldly mysteries to worry about. It may shock you to learn that we were recently duped by "normal" gardening sim Grunn, which was not normal at all. But don't worry, it won't happen again. Today we bring you the ordinary and not-one-bit-suspicious Trip, which sees players wandering from carriage to carriage, chatting pleasantly with passengers during a long train journey. How long? Let me look at the timetable here, let's see... "Forever," it says. Hm. Must be a misprint.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the cutest type of eyeball? This question has plagued the games industry since Nintendo first allowed millions of unsupervised children to play god with Mii avatars and their customisable peepers. In low-stakes fishing game Webfishing, you can give your fuzzy avatar one of 33 styles of eye (I counted). This is the mark of a solid Animal Crossing-like. There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, a game needs an original premise before I'll write it up, and sometimes, it just needs a flying car, or a slick revolver with chambers outlined in mouthwatering red neon. Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

I was very close to buying the recent remake, actually, until I watched the extended prank scene online and realized, oh no, they’re taking themselves seriously now. They prestige-ified it. It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

With estimated profits of £475,000, across four years of offending, the man was sentenced to two years' prison and a further two on license, the Federation Against Copyright Theft reports. Is that sentence too long, or not long enough? That could depend on relevant information that FACT isn't reporting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backyard Basketball, is finally ready to come off the bench for some sweet public testing! You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie!
Much like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.
Are you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest daily build!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hodně mi to připomnělo "On se bojí" nebo filmy Charlieho Kaufmana. "Jiný člověk" je ale "tlumenější" a první půlhodinu vypadá skoro jako normální film, který možná není úplně podařeně natočený. Teprve pak to začne být opravdu divné a vyjde najevo, že to od počátku všechno byl sofistikovaný plán filmařů a že tím asi chtěli něco říct. (Ilča 70 %)]]></summary>

Pojďme natočit něco pro NORMÁLNÍ děti!" A to je škoda, protože tenhle film si klade potenciálně velmi zajímavé otázky, ale většinu z nich ignoruje na úkor roztomilých zvířátek a ujetého robota.
