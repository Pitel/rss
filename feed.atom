As you might've seen in the summer gaming streams, there are too many frog games to keep track of this year (arguably a good problem to have!), but one of them, above all, is not leaving my sight. Frogun is a collectible-grabbing 3D platformer inspired by the Nintendo 64 and PS1 era, and its protagonist, Renata, wields a frog that is also a "gun."
It's a genre close to my heart, with a cute style, and I'm all about it.

After making the wholesome rounds and recently sharing a demo on Steam, developer Molegato is now in the home stretch. Frogun will release on August 2, 2022, across Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. That's... pretty soon!

It looks like The DioField Chronicle is just around the corner. The new RPG from Lancarse and Square Enix has a release date set for September 22, 2022.
The date was first shown during a livestream about The DioField Chronicle for Japan, with a date of September 22, 2022 but no mention if that included North America.
Store pages and pre-orders have been going up, however, with a Sept. 22 date set on the PlayStation Store, Xbox store, Steam, and Square Enix Store.
The DioField Chronicle is retailing for $59.99, though a Deluxe Edition can nab you some extras for $74.99. Or there's the $169.99 Collector's Edition set, which includes a full-on board game based on The DioField Chronicle. I do respect the creativity with this particular pack-in.

It was me, The DioField Chronicle
The DioField Chronicle is a new strategy RPG from Square Enix and Lancarse. It follows a band of mercenaries called Blue Fox, as war erupts around them.
It advertises a real-time battle system that utilizes strategy and decision-making about units' strengths and weaknesses.
Plus, it's also got a diorama-style visual for battles that looks pretty great. It's reminding me a bit of Triangle Strategy with its isometric view and shading.

The DioField Chronicle was first revealed during a Sony State of Play in March, alongside another Square Enix game Valkyrie Elysium. That new Valkyrie game has been locked in for a September 29 date for PlayStation platforms, with a PC launch coming later on November 11.
It looks like between those two games and the Crisis Core remaster, Square Enix has a good amount of games in store for the months ahead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fall Guys proves it has legs
Fall Guys has been one of the most successful online games over the past few years, and for good reason. After the flood of battle royale games we got, it was a nice change of pace to have one that was a colorful, goofy platformer that we could play with friends. I know I certainly got swept up in it when it first came out, and had a blast trying something new even if I was terrible. Now, Fall Guys is seeing even more success, and I couldn't be happier that a creative and genuinely fun idea is getting the love it deserves.
The official Fall Guys account tweeted this morning that the game has officially surpassed 50 million players! Exciting news for a game with such humble beginnings. If you're wondering why the game is just now garnering such a big player base, it's because Fall Guys just switched to a free-to-play model with battle passes and all that good stuff on June 21. The other significant change was that it moved off of Steam and onto the Epic Games Launcher, and was made available on Xbox and Nintendo Switch for the first time.
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1544698314242793473
After the rerelease, Fall Guys garnered 20 million players in 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive feat for a game that's over two years old. Now it's more than doubled that after two weeks.
If nothing else, this scenario has proved that the free-to-play model can be pretty effective at getting players to try a new game, and because the outfits are such a fun part of Fall Guys, the battle pass system should work well for them. Here's hoping that the game continues to stick around for a while, because every time I see clips of it, it just makes me happy.
I guess now is a better time than any to jump back on the train, and try to claim a crown of my own once and for all.

The Competition and Markets Authority is looking into Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The UK regulator is officially looking into whether the deal could be anti-competitive.
September 1 is the deadline for the first phase of the investigation. In this phase, the CMA will determine whether Microsoft's Activision Blizzard deal could harm competition, and if it should launch an in-depth investigation. It's also inviting comments on the transaction from any interested party.
"As with all merger reviews, this investigation will consider whether the deal could harm competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers—for example, through higher prices, lower quality, or reduced choice," the CMA said (via GamesIndustry.biz).
Microsoft corporate VP and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said (via CNBC) that regulatory scrutiny of the deal was to be expected. Microsoft will "fully cooperate" with the CMA.
"We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition," said Tanzi. She also added that Microsoft remains "confident" the deal will close in fiscal year 2023.

A massive merger
The scrutiny isn't a surprise, especially with a deal as big as Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard. The CMA in the UK is not the only one looking into it, either. The FTC is also investigating the deal, as chair Lina Khan told lawmakers in June. The FTC's investigation will look at, among other things, how the deal would impact workers at Activision Blizzard.
The $68.7 billion deal was announced in January, and made a lot of waves. With a portfolio of games including Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, Warcraft, and much more, it could be a huge deal for Microsoft once the ink dries.

Gwent is back on the table, as CD Projekt Red reveals a new style of The Witcher card game is coming very soon. Gwent: Rogue Mage takes a deckbuilding, roguelike approach to Gwent, and it's out for PC, Android, and iOS on July 7.
IGN revealed the game this morning, as a standalone expansion of Gwent. It will have the same core mechanics, but operate a bit differently; first and foremost, it's a roguelike.
Players start with a set of cards in their deck, focusing on certain playstyles. Then more cards can be added as more nodes on the map are explored. Experience gained over the course of each run goes towards increasing the pool and strength of cards available in each run.

Square Enix has announced that it will release its upcoming fantasy action-adventure Valkyrie Elysium this fall. The Soleil-developed RPG will arrive on PlayStation platforms September 29, with a PC release to follow a little over a month later on November 11.
The latest release in the long-running Valkyrie/Valkyrie Profile series, Valkyrie Elysium will feature all of the deep adventure and Norse mythology that is the franchise's trademark. The plot sees the coming of Ragnarok, the cataclysmic event fated to destroy the world, the gods, and civilization itself. With the end times looming, the mighty Odin creates a sole emissary, Valkyrie, who stands as the final opposition to the collapse of the kingdom of the gods.
https://youtu.be/XXG0xBnY_zo
Valkyrie Elysium will incorporate the series’ trademark "Einherjar" spirit battles, while adding all-new mechanics such as the "Soul Chain" combo system. As they embark upon their quest, players will be able to further customize their weaponry, gear, and abilities to access more powerful spirits, skills, and devastating "Divine Arts." Valkyrie Elysium will retain the series' pedigree for beautiful and sweeping worlds, punctuated by an evocative score from series veteran composer Motoi Sakuraba.
Valkyrie Elysium will launch on PlayStation September 29, with PC (Steam) to follow on November 11. The PlayStation version of the Deluxe Digital Edition will also include a brand new port of the 1999 PSP release Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. The PC release will not, unfortunately, include this port.

Dreamed Away is a lovely-looking pixel-art RPG being published by Pineapple Works, and it's coming to Switch late next year. This game looks warm and cosy on the surface, but underneath its guise hides a mystical, unsettling vibe that's akin to Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away.
Developed by solo developer Nicolas Petton, who was inspired to create the game after the birth of his second child. Dreamed Away focuses on the sibling bond between Théo and his sister Louise in a small French village in Brittany. Théo wishes to reconnect with his sister, but struggles emotionally, which is where the cosiness and charm wash away into something a bit darker.

While modern Blizzard is perhaps best known for constantly putting out fires and fixing game launches, old-school Blizzard was practically untouchable from a quality point of view. This Wrath of the Lich King retrospective showcases one of the publisher's best periods, when for many, World of Warcraft was arguably at its best (Burning Crusade is the right answer, but that's neither here nor there).
The series is called Building Azeroth: Northrend, and the cast includes Ely Cannon (Art Director World of Warcraft), Sarah Boulian Verrall (Lead Level Designer World of Warcraft), and Aaron Keller (Game Director Overwatch), as they muse on their time with the series, and direct involvement with the original expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.

The tech demo experience The Matrix Awakens is leaving digital storefronts soon. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S owners have until July 9 to pick this demo up, before it departs.
Announced during the 2021 Game Awards, The Matrix Awakens is an Unreal Engine 5 tech demo that also intersects with The Matrix. It features performances from Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in alarmingly realistic CG.
But it's also not just a cutscene, but some playable slices of game and an open-world sandbox where you can mess with the world. Different areas show off parts of Unreal Engine 5's tech. It is a tech demo, after all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU0gvPcc3jQ
The Matrix is here
It's a fun demo with some neat tech to show off, and is already worth the low, low price of free for that. But for Matrix fans, there's also some charming banter between Reeves' Neo and Moss' Trinity that makes for a genuinely nice little slice of game. It would kind of rule to see a new Matrix game with this kind of approach. Especially considering how wild The Matrix Online got.
You can find The Matrix Awakens tech demo on the PlayStation Store and Xbox store until July 9, 2022.
Meanwhile, if The Matrix Awakens awoke a taste for new Matrix games for you, there's not much else new. You can, however, check this cool Sifu mod that replaces the main character with Neo and the enemies with Agent Smith. It's not the Path of Neo, but it's a mod that unsurprisingly fits the mood of the Burly Brawl from The Matrix Reloaded. Agent Smith just cannot catch a break, no matter where in The Matrix he goes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Virtual neutrality.
Thanks to ray casting, an early form of graphics processing that allowed the rendering of a 2D map as a pseudo-3D environment, Zero Tolerance, a true First-Person Shooter, arrived on Sega’s Mega Drive in 1994.
What makes Zero Tolerance Collection significant — particularly for fans of the original — is its boast of additional items of lore: an unreleased sequel, Zero Tolerance Underground, and the prototype title Beyond Zero Tolerance. As it happens, Zero Tolerance Underground is falsely advertised, and not a true sequel at all. Its nine stages (as opposed to the original game’s 40) were actually designed as bonus extras for a Mega CD port of Zero Tolerance that never saw the light of day. Beyond Zero Tolerance, the unfinished prototype meant as a true sequel, would be of greater appeal if it hadn’t already been legally released on the internet as freeware.

Genshin Impact is still trucking, and as we move into the eventual 3.0 expansion, the team is incrementally adding more stuff through new updates (2.8 is arriving on July 13). The next tie-in event is the Genshin Impact slime game Bouncing Blobby Slimes, which you can play now via a web app.
Unlike several other previous web games, this one is entirely skill-based. You'll take various slimes (with different properties and physics systems) and jump from block to block in a bid to score as many points as possible. To jump, you just hold on the screen (or click), aim the jump, then release to fling your slime. The closer you are to the middle of the platform when you land, the more score you'll net.

To play more levels you'll need stamina, which is tied to:
Logging in to the web event daily
Logging into Genshin Impact daily
Completing two daily commissions in Genshin Impact daily
Using 40 original resin in Genshin Impact daily
Visiting the HoYoLAB website
Rewards include the typical loot linked to these types of things:
Primogems
Enhancement ore
Mora (gold)
Hero's Wit (XP boosting books)
The event is more fun than a lot of former tie-ins because of the interactive element, so give it a shot if you still play Genshin. You can partake until July 10 at 23:59 (UTC+8).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still due "this winter"
Square Enix has showcased some extra Final Fantasy VII Remake Crisis Core quality of life changes via a new tweet, and most of them look great. Let's take a look at what Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion has in store for us eventually (the publisher is still sticking to a release window of "this winter" as of this week).
Here are the main Final Fantasy VII Remake Crisis Core quality of life upgrades:
Improved camera
Optimized UI
New menu-based battle system
New background music (by Takeharu Ishimoto, who worked on Legend of Mana, Kingdom Hearts, and several modern Final Fantasy games)
Full voiceover for text-based scenes in the original
I bolded the "new battle system," as that's easily going to be one of the most interesting elements of the remake, depending on how Square Enix handles it. While I lived through it on PSP (and came out fine), searching for discussions on the original "roulette" style battle system will garner results from "who the hell thought the roulette thing was a good idea?" to "it was one of my favorite parts of the game."
It remains to be seen how much has changed in the remake, as the roulette mechanic seems to still exist, based on the inaugural trailer. My guess is a lot of folks will see any change as an upgrade!

Fall Guys went free-to-play just over two weeks ago when it finally debuted on Switch in June. Mediatonic's colourful multiplayer game has already hit a milestone of 20 million players within 48 hours, and those numbers have more than doubled since then.
Mediatonic celebrated with a rather bright and bean-y visual of a world full of Fall Guys over on the game's official Twitter account:

We need more frog-influenced platformers in our lives, right? Well, Frogun might just have us covered then. Even if you aren't controlling an actual frog...
Today, developer Molegato and publisher Top Hat Studios announced that this nostalgic 90s-style platformer will be launching on the Switch on 2nd August. The game's publisher describes Frogun as "an old-school platformer with the soul of the PS1/N64 era", and it certainly looks that way. From the low-poly visuals and the unusual frog-grappling mechanics (your frog friend can be used as a grappling hook. It's cute. But it's weird because it's also a gun), right down to the bubbly music, we're getting the warm fuzzies just watching the trailer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Luminous game takes some more time
Forspoken is slipping out of this year. Square Enix confirms today that its action-RPG Forspoken is now set to launch on January 24, 2023.
On social media, the team says that all game elements are complete, and development is in its final polishing phase. But as a result of "ongoing discussions with key partners," Square Enix and Luminous Productions have decided to move the date back.
https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1544675140780392453
Previously, Forspoken was set for October 11, which was pushed back from a date in May. At the time, Square and Luminous said it needed some extra time to get it right.
Another one joins the 2023 calendar
While this move pushes Forspoken out and away from the fall window with games like Marvel's Midnight Suns, it's still headed into a growing 2023 lineup. The Dead Space remake is set for January 27, 2023, just a few days later.
Other big games have also moved into 2023, including the sequel to Breath of the Wild, Starfield, and Redfall. Plus, Final Fantasy XVI is currently slotted for a summer 2023 window.
Basically, next year is looking stacked with games already. It's not like this year will be quiet, though. Sony Santa Monica announced that God of War Ragnarok arrives on November 9, 2022.
As for Forspoken, it's been an interesting one to follow. The game previously dubbed Project Athia is an action-RPG, starring a girl named Frey who gets transported to another world and gains magical powers. It's a gorgeous game, even if the narrative gave a moment's pause. Square Enix says more information is on the way about Frey's journey this summer, so there might still be some more to learn before it heads back into prep for the new year.
Forspoken will now be starting off the new year's release schedule on PlayStation 5 and PC on January 24, 2023.

Yes, your eyes aren't deceiving you — the Wii Shop Channel and DSi shop are finally accessible again after the two were suffering outages for months.

We can all get back to listening to that jingle again just in time for Wii Shop Wednesday!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.]]></summary>

Pre-heating the oven and a rigorous badminton schedule didn't mingle too well with an open world that demanded every ounce of my concentration. I went MIA from the Lands Between for three months, spending my time watching cushy reality TV like Below Deck Mediterranean and lying in my bed, hoping its springs would somehow channel electricity into my bones and recharge my weary mind.
Over the past few days I've returned to the Lands Between with renewed vigor. I've taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn't stop for even a second. In doing everything it takes to finish this game before I burn out again, I've learned the importance of investment and why spending is good, actually.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['Multi-game showcase' to kick off fall season
Publisher Ubisoft, conspicuous by its absence during this summer's live stream series, has announced that it will be holding its next premier "Ubisoft Forward" live stream this September, where it will offer news, updates, and reveals pertaining to the company's current and forthcoming releases.
"On September 10 at 12:00 PT / 21:00 CEST, Ubisoft Forward returns in full force, ready to reveal updates and news on multiple games and projects from Ubisoft teams around the world," wrote the publisher on its website. "Ubisoft Forward will broadcast on YouTube, Twitch, and on our official website. We'll have more to share about Ubisoft Forward as we get closer to the event, so be sure to keep an eye on Ubisoft News for the latest updates."
Additionally, Ubisoft will host a live stream presentation tomorrow, July 7, focused entirely on its seafaring RPG Skull and Bones (formerly "Skull & Bones"). This spotlight event is expected to showcase extended gameplay of the upcoming adventure game, which will see players engaging in period piece naval warfare on the waves of the Indian Ocean. Currently in development for PS4, PC, and Xbox One, we are still to receive a release date for Skull and Bones — so perhaps we'll hear more about the game's launch window during tomorrow's stream.
The "Ubisoft Forward Spotlight On Skull and Bones" live stream kicks off tomorrow at 11:00 PT / 14:00 / 19:00 BST and can be watched via the official Ubisoft YouTube and Twitch channels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.
Replaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.

That's because, alongside that cinematic "Father and Son" trailer, the studio has released a new unboxing video for the game's Collector's and Jötnar editions. 
As you might expect, both editions of Ragnarok look fantastic. It doesn't hurt that both come in a fancy Knowledge Keeper's Shrine box that features beautiful artwork and plenty of fun goodies inside. Check them both out for yourself in the trailer below:

Nintendo has announced a new Splatoon 3 Switch OLED, which is set to be released later this year on August 26, right before the game launches on September 9.
The publisher has provided a full look at the system (front and back) in the video below, as well as the dock and the Joy-Con layout. Nintendo describes the color scheme as "a set of one blue and one yellow gradient Joy-Con controllers with white underbellies and a white, graffiti-themed Nintendo Switch dock."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUwmGziglpc
The company reiterates that this will be the same Switch OLED model that sports the 7-inch upgraded screen, complete with the wired LAN port in the dock, and 64GB of storage space. In other words, you aren't missing much if you don't want the new dock or the Joy-Con. The Splatoon 3 Switch OLED will cost $359.99.
I won't lose sleep over not picking this one up, but Splatoon fans will likely jump at the opportunity to pick something up! It's not every day (or year, really) that Splatoon gets a big celebration like this in hardware form.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1544667690484252672
Also arriving on September 9 is the Splatoon 3 Switch Pro Controller (which will retail for $74.99), and the Splatoon 3 Switch carrying case (which retails for $24.99).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Sony Santa Monica Studio have released a brand new God of War: Ragnarok trailer, revealing that the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2018's God of War will be released this November. 
More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we're less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic "Father and Son" trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.]]></summary>

Nintendo just announced a Mario + Rabbids free trial on Switch, and it kicks off today, running through July 12.
To be exact, the trial actually starts today, July 6, at 10AM PT, and will run through July 12 at 11:59. So if you think you can get through roughly 20-ish hours of story in six days, you can just finish it! This trial comes directly after the release date announcement for the sequel, which is coming later this year in October.
Like all trials, you need to be a Switch Online subscriber to partake. You can find the trial here, or via the eShop directly on the Switch.
There's two bonuses to this July 2022 Mario + Rabbids free trial run
The full game is on sale for $9.99 through July 20: so if you decide to buy in, you can upgrade to the full version from the trial (Nintendo also reminds us that save data will be preserved, so you won't need to start over if you upgrade after the trial)
As usual, you'll net 100 platinum for participating in the trial: if you own the full game, just boot it up during this period to get the points

Specifically, the strain they must be under carrying those preposterously high columns of metal cased packages up and down the slopes of post-apocalyptic America. If I were in his hiking boots, I'm not sure all the reinforced skeletons in the world would help me reach the same kind of porter-ing skills as he does gambolling about the place, at least not based on how sore and tired my dinky little wrists are after a couple of hours of playing Strange Scaffold's new Strand-type game, Witch Strandings. Yes, that's right. Someone other than Hideo Kojima has made a so-called Strand-like, and it's quite possibly the strangest game you'll play all year.

More specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. 


The game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're LIVE from the past, present, and future.
If you have any interest in Super Nintendo RPGs, then you’ve likely heard of Live A Live. Released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, it came out during what many claim is Square Enix's — then known as Square, or Squaresoft in the West — 'Golden Era', launching just under a year after Secret of Mana, and barely six months after Final Fantasy VI, two of the developer’s most well-known games on the system. Oh, and just months later, something called Chrono Trigger came out, too. Not a bad time for the RPG developer, then?
Unlike the aforementioned trio, however, this game never saw an official release outside of Japan – until now. Live A Live has been revived for the modern age with a glorious HD-2D lick of paint, the same retro-modern visual style made famous by Octopath Traveler and used again in Triangle Strategy. We’ve had a chance to go hands-on with four of the game’s chapters – three of which are playable in the recently released demo — and we can confidently say that, even 28 years later, Live A Live still feels like one of the most unique RPG experiences we’ve ever sat down with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.
I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It's Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.]]></summary>

For days I’ve been absorbing these images of a baby CPU air cooler, yoked to the dinkiest of PC storage, and I still can’t decide if it’s brilliant or just sheer crawling madness.


Except, in the not-so-distant future, there’s a chance that active SSD cooling won’t seem so excessive at all. That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures. And, in turn, a higher risk of throttling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Type-Moons first localised visual novel.
Developer Type-Moon, known for the Tsukihime series (which includes the fighting game series Melty Blood) and the Fate series, has never really cracked the Western market with its visual novels. While beloved worldwide by genre fans, the developer's VN output has never been localised. Which makes this announcement even more exciting for Type-Moon fans.
Witch on the Holy Night marks the first time a Type-Moon visual novel has received an official English localisation, and it's coming to Switch on 8th December. This was announced at this weekend's Anime Expo during the Fate/Grand Order panel. Published by Aniplex, this release is an enhanced version of the 2012 game of the same name (Mahoutsukai no Yoru) and will include voice acting, higher definition artwork, and will be playable in English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

A new Fall Guys event is rolling in on Thursday, bringing some more Assassin's Creed theming. Abstergo's Challenge adds some new objectives to complete for prizes, while Eivor and Odin roll into the Fall Guys Store.
Abstergo's Challenge kicks off on July 7, with a bunch of objectives themed around the game mode Sweet Thieves. This is the mode where one team plays invisible beans, trying to steal away candy, while the guardians of the candy try to grab and capture them.
Beating objectives like winning as a Thief or Guardian, as well as carrying enough candy and pressing buttons, gets you points in Abstergo's Challenge. Prizes include a title, pattern, and a shiny Apple of Eden-styled backpack.

Cuphead is built upon the fun of replaying and mastering boss fights, and that also goes for the new DLC, The Delicious Last Course.

With a hidden input.
Without spoiling anything, if you ever want to replay the DLC's secret boss (or just try the ghost-busting mausoleums again for the heck of it), here's how: stand facing the level entrance on Cuphead's overworld and hold the L+R triggers until it opens back up.

It's been over a decade since former Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono asked a room of San Diego Comic-Con attendees to literally wave money in the air to "prove" how much they wanted a brand new title in M.I.A. series Darkstalkers. And how many sequels has the Gothic fight franchise seen since that fateful show of dedication? Try zero. The stunt didn't take with the suits, and Darkstalkers remains in a shallow grave on the grounds of Capcom HQ.
One thing that Capcom has been showing passion for, however, is retro compilations, having released three such titles in as many years. Today, we're looking at Capcom Fighting Collection, which compiles a fistful of coin-op hits, most of which were not featured in the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom recently announced a 10-game Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, bundling together the six Game Boy Advance Battle Network titles and the various versions that were originally released. I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …]]></summary>

That makes it a slightly odd fit for new characters like Invader Zim or Rocko from Rocko's Modern Life, but well, that's what is coming later this month, alongside a handful of other Nickelodeon characters.

It looks like Rockstar may be laying off the remasters for a bit. A new report says remasters of both Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto IV were in consideration, but now Rockstar is shelving the projects.
Word first broke from Rockstar leaker Tez, who claimed a reliable source said these remasters were "on the table a few years ago," but Rockstar has chosen not to proceed with the projects in mind.
Today, Kotaku followed up with a report, saying they could confirm that Tez's tweet is accurate to what they've been told.
https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1543974193259319303
The decision seems to be indicative of the poor response Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition received. Response at launch indicates it was a technical mess, with patches rolling out soon after to try and tune the project. Rockstar publicly apologized for the state of the Trilogy.
As both Tez and Kotaku indicate, it looks like the remaster trilogy put some ideas on hold. According to Kotaku's sources, Rockstar is hoping people will forget about the remaster as it focuses its attention on Grand Theft Auto VI.
Kotaku does say that while the plan is to get the next GTA out the door, the future is open. Their sources say a possible Red Dead Redemption or GTA IV remaster aren't "out of scope" and could happen after VI ships.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1JJt7xHTlE
Taking some time
The possibility of a Red Dead Redemption remaster in particular is tantalizing. It's also been rumored for a while now. A report from Kotaku last year revealing the Trilogy remaster also indicated RDR would be due up, if the re-releases did well.
It now looks like those plans will have to wait until after Grand Theft Auto VI is out, though.

Splatoon 3 is steadily approaching, and the team has been teasing some more of what's to come. Yesterday, the Splatoon NA Twitter account posted a teaser of a Splatoon 3 map in some decaying ruins.
Dubbed "Mincemeat Metalworks," this facility was made from scrap metal, in order to make more metal. There's also some notable commentary here, that there was once a sea here but it evaporated.
The map itself has a cool juxtaposition between the cold steel ruins, baking in the sun and heat, with the paint globs and inflatable cover Splatoon is known for.
https://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1543942800005267456
The whole vibe of Splatoon 3 seems to carry on this theme of aquatic life taking over a messed-up world. It's worked well for Splatoon in the past, and the Splatlands seems like it could be a cool new area to explore.
Enter the Splatlands
It's not just new maps, though. Splatoon 3 also has some cosmetic changes that will help players have a much more visually distinct squid-kid avatar.
The team recently showed off the tricolor eyes and customizable eyebrows that Splatoon 3 will have as well. Plus, new hairstyles and fresh fashion. I mean, Splatoon is an ink-based shooter, but it's also about fashion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ngPsn5d5A
Splatoon 3 was recently locked in for a September 9 date on Nintendo Switch. The messy shooter will essentially close out Nintendo's summer. Hopefully we get to see more of it soon; while we've had updates on the multiplayer and PvE Salmon Run mode, I'd still love to see a deeper dive into the single-player portion.
Whether we get a Direct with more info soon or not, Splatoon 3 is set to launch on September 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones, Ubisoft's long-delayed pirate multiplayer game, rises from the depths of the sea on Thursday during a livestream presentation. Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.
Ubisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.
Until then, are you excited for Skull & Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft's pirate-focused Assassins' Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft says it has "reached the limit"
It's hard for Games with Gold to stand out in this giveaway-heavy climate, especially with so many players fixated on Xbox Game Pass, where the catalog runs deep and feels pretty consistently fresh. Today, Microsoft gave a heads-up about an upcoming change: starting in October 2022, the monthly "free" game lineups will no longer feature Xbox 360 titles.
The team explained the change in an email to Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and it makes sense — but I've still got questions.
"We have reached the limit of our ability to bring Xbox 360 games to the catalog; however, Games with Gold will continue to include exciting Xbox One titles and exclusive savings each month," the company said in an email. "This will not impact any Xbox 360 games that you downloaded before October 2022."
"Any Xbox 360 titles that you redeem via Games with Gold before that time are yours to keep on your Xbox account, regardless of whether you continue your subscription. Thank you for being a loyal member."
[caption id="attachment_333275" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Xbox Games with Gold for July 2022.[/caption]
So, we've got a few more months of business as usual with a pair of featured Xbox One and Xbox 360 games for subscribers to claim and keep. For reference, the sleepy selections for July — Beasts of Maravilla Island, Relicta, Thrillville: Off the Rails, and Torchlight — are a good indicator of where things are at with Games with Gold.
I'm curious to see how they might offset this change in October — will subscribers get more than two Xbox One games each month? Or is a quality-over-quantity approach a better choice? We've been through downgrades before with, say, PlayStation Plus.
Games with Gold can feel like a relic, and I have to wonder how much longer it'll last before it's refocused or fully sunsetted. With today's news, that timeline feels closer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great games for a good cause
Itch.io is known for its bundles of indie games that raise money for worthy causes, like the Black Lives Matter movement back in 2020 or for Ukraine earlier this year. Now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, itch.io has turned its sights to creating a bundle of indie games to raise money for abortion funds. The bundle has over 750 items from over 600 creators, valued at around $3000, but you can get it for a minimum donation of $10 (although of course, anything more than that is awesome). As someone who adores indie games, that's the steal of the century if you ask me.
All proceeds of the bundle will go directly towards the National Network for Abortion Fund's Collective Power Fund which, according to the bundle's official page, "moves money directly to abortion funds across 20+ U.S. states, with a particular focus on the South and Midwest (where it is often most difficult to get access to abortions). NNAF’s partnerships with these abortion funds provide direct resources and funds to many of the people most impacted by Roe v. Wade, towards immediate action."
From the sounds of it, this is a great way to get started if you're looking for a way to support the cause.
https://twitter.com/itchio/status/1543972913476280321
As of writing this article, the bundle has already raised over $150,000 of its $200,000 goal, and with over eight days left, I have a feeling it will surpass that number. The Ukraine bundle ended up with more than $6 million going to charity, while the Racial Equality bundle raised a whopping $8.1 million.
Here's hoping that gamers will show up for reproductive rights in the same way, but considering how much the community shows up in times of need, plus what great titles there are on offer, I don't think we have anything to worry about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[90 Minutes European Prime Goal was the final piece of the puzzle
This incredible SNES manuals project is finally complete, having secured the last English SNES instruction book they needed. The project recently announced on Twitter that they had acquired a scan for the English manual for 90 Minutes European Prime Goal, which, while not a marquee SNES release, was the last manual!
As project purveyor Peebs points out, this started as a grassroots effort roughly two years ago to get that number up to 100% from the previous figure of 52%. For reference, that's over 800 manuals that are housed on the site, which you can access directly here. They're lived-in, too! You can even see the imperfections and wear and tear on some — in a good way.
Flipping through the project list (which I recommend doing at least once) showcases the raw scope of it. Remember this is every English manual, even ones that are from the NA/PAL regions, as well as manuals with errors or slight phrasing differences. And rather than resting on their laurels, the crew is pursuing Super Famicom (Japan) manual logging as we speak.
SNES manuals aren't the only thing on offer
Of note: the manual project also has Nintendo 64 manuals available, as well as all 22 Virtual Boy games covered. No lie, the latter comes in real handy whenever I bust out my Virtual Boy! There's some neat IPD (interpupillary distance) configuration type stuff in some of those booklets.
Interestingly, Nintendo still has its archive of NES and SNES manuals up to coincide with the release of the "Mini" console lines.

Veteran video game writer Mary DeMarle has confirmed that they will be joining BioWare in order to pen the narrative for the next entry in the epic and much-beloved sci-fi franchise, Mass Effect. Game Director Michael Gamble confirmed the signing on social media yesterday.
"Oh, hey! I’m really excited to let you know that Mary DeMarle will be joining the Mass Effect team as Senior Narrative Director," wrote Gamble on Twitter. "You’ve seen her work in Guardians of the Galaxy & Deus Ex (to name a few!). She’s amazing."
https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1544057781619044353?s=20&t=XtimLuMwQbWu1roJUmzFyQ
As noted by Gamble, DeMarle is no stranger to epic, dramatic, and operatic storytelling, having penned the excellent Deus Ex games for Crystal Dynamics, and the recent comic-book adventure Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. These are both titles that deal with group dynamics, friendship, politics, technology, moral turbulence, and character-based comedy — all traits that make up the emotive space opera universe of Mass Effect.
DeMarle's new role at BioWare follows their leaving Eidos Montreal in the wake of the Embracer Group purchase. With a resume of stone-cold narrative classics, and multiple awards to their name, DeMarle is a valuable, prestigious, and highly sought-after writer. No doubt their talent for engrossing, compelling, and, most importantly, immersive storytelling will be a major ace in "Mass Effect 4's" sleeve. Mass Effect is its story — it always has been — and it's comforting to know that the next chapter is in safe hands.
The next chapter of Mass Effect is currently in development at BioWare.

The Fallout 76 content drops seemingly never end, which is...a good thing for folks who bought it and always wanted the game to improve. The next one involves a new Fallout 76 PTS period, which will add content to the live version "later this summer." It's more stuff for The Pitt!
Through the PTS you can partake in the "From Ashes to Fire" mission, as well as any quality of life upgrades and fixes that are part of the new build (a "new round of bug fixes" is already confirmed). To diffuse the confusion, The Pitt expeditions are already part of the game currently, as you'll be able to go on little micro-quests there — but a bigger expansion is also coming eventually.
As a reminder, the Fallout 76 PTS has now fully moved to Steam at this point in Fallout 76‘s lifecycle, and is no longer tethered to the Bethesda Launcher in any shape or form. For more details on how to migrate all that over to Steam, read this article. Bethesda also keeps a running log of recent PTS updates, which patch notes, improvements, and fixes to boot. You can find that log here, just remember that it's going to shift depending on feedback.

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It's attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More news on Ubisoft's projects is on the way
The pirating world of Skull and Bones is re-emerging. Ubisoft is hosting a worldwide gameplay reveal on July 7, showcasing a new look at the seafaring multiplayer game.
This isn't quite the first-ever reveal of Skull and Bones footage. We've seen a few gameplay looks in the past, dating back several years. But Ubisoft's pirate game has been quiet for quite a while, resurfacing here and there in financial statements and reports.
On July 7 at 11 a.m. PT, Ubisoft will get a chance at making a new impression for Skull and Bones. The pre-show will start at 10:45 a.m. PT, followed by new gameplay and a behind-the-scenes with the developers.

For plunder and fortune
There was a supposedly leaked gameplay video not long ago, showcasing what Ubisoft's Skull and Bones currently looks like. The video, as a sort-of tutorial for various game mechanics, showed resource collecting, management, and sailing the high seas looking for combat with other ships.
At the time, the official account shared a video, asking fans to keep their eyes on the horizon. Seems like it's time for the official re-reveal later this week.
Ubisoft has also locked in a new multi-game showcase later this year on September 10, at 12 p.m. PT. While this week's spotlight will focus on Skull and Bones, the upcoming September showcase will feature updates and news on multiple projects from Ubisoft's teams around the world. Considering that Ubisoft has many projects in development, ranging from a new Avatar game and Beyond Good & Evil 2 to XDefiant and Project Q, expect just about anything.

Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.

Black Forest Games' remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said "The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside." The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone who's played one of Firaxis' XCOM games in the last ten years will have a story about missed shots. Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they're an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis' creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  
"It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated. I felt the ghosts of everybody everywhere looking over my shoulder," he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an FPS game that's not all about which assault rifle has the best vertical foregrip? Well, Snow War looks to fill that gap. As a modern revamp of an 18-year-old Half-Life mod by the same name, it's an FPS where bullets are spheres of snow and guns are human arms... and snowball-launching crossbows. Not to mention it's set in the 80's with a synthwave backing track. I'm sold.

We jumped back into its ongoing second beta, in the hopes that we'd finally wrap our heads around the game. Maybe we'd got it all wrong the first time around? It's the sequel to the biggest hero shooter out there! This time, this time we'd feel the "2" part come alive beneath our fingertips as we insta-locked Torbjorn on attack.
Dear reader, Liam and I emerged from our Overwatch 2 session having had a marvellous chat. We caught up on life, talked about Monster Hunter Rise, and how nice it is that the RPS Treehouse is complete again. Everything except Overwatch 2 itself was discussed... Which says it all, really.

Komentuje to jednoduše: situace s X11 se nijak nelepší a Wayland je již široce podporován. Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje. Dodává také, že řeči jsou jedna věc, ale pokud kód [podpory X11] nikdo nenapíše, tak prostě nebude.]]></summary>

Netflix just posted the intro to the upcoming Cyberpunk anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and it's got a Franz Ferdinand track over the top - but hey, it's still pretty good.

The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative.

Admittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem. In it, the crew of the Invincible spacecraft investigates the planet Regis III for its mis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While writing a post about the Deus Ex randomiser mod last month, I tried to find a high-resolution clean version of the venerated immersive sim's box art to use as a header image. I trawled through archives of official sites hoping to discover that the marketing department had released it as a wallpaper or something, to no avail. But I did find a load of other official Deus Ex wallpapers which are so delightfully turn-of-the-millenium. Scanlines! Lensflare! Photoshop Difference Clouds filters! Come, admire, enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've seen sequels rise above and plummet below their precursors. Months ago, I said Overwatch 2 was a redemption arc. And now that the Beta is out on my preferred platform (Xbox), I've gotten the chance to sleep-dart and pulse-bomb my way through multiple game types, arenas, and heroes without the difficulties of mouse and keyboard controls. In other words, I'm confident that Overwatch 2 might not look like a completely different experience from its forebear, but it definitely plays like one.  


It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the …]]></summary>

Kicking off his first adventure in 1992, Kirby has grown into a juggernaut in the game industry, starring in dozens of titles and making appearances in countless others. The long-running franchise is among video games’ best-selling. One of its most successful titles, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released in March 2022. It’s not only breaking series records but also sucked in a whole new generation of fans. To celebrate the formidable gumball’s third decade in the industry, we’re looking back at the franchise, from how it started to where it’s floating now.

I can confirm it's really good! A lovely point and click mystery with some tricksy puzzles, but unlimited goes so you still get to feel clever - plus the story plays with some mystery tropes in really fun ways. But the real joy is its characters. It's a cast of suspects that are both wacky and relatable, and I love them.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/01/new-cult-of-the-lamb-trailer-highlights-best-practices-for-keeping-your-cult-happy"/>
        <updated>2022-07-01T18:59:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It's hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.]]></summary>

The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. 
This news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima. In this blog post, though, the studio clarifies some things amidst rumors of a Sly Cooper 5 and an Infamous remake.

I've nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well.

At least you'll get some good, cheap kit in return, and there are already enough sales knocking about for a roundup of the best early Prime Day PC gaming deals.
The nice thing about these is that, unlike the deals that launch on Prime Day itself (July 12-13th), you won't need an Amazon Prime account to take advantage of them. In fact, many of them aren't on Amazon at all - while Amazon’s Prime Day landing page is up and already pointing to various discounts, rival retailers have some price-matched or even better savings as well.

Announced earlier this week as part of the game's 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone's hair / fur. And in a game about felling all manner of feathery, scaly lizard animals, that's not exactly ideal.

What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …]]></summary>

The pack promises to introduce staples of high school life like attending classes, getting detention, going to prom, and graduating, all as on-screen activities that the player can guide their Sims through. While there's a fair bit of overlap with the series' established college-themed expansion packs like The Sims 4 Discover University, giving this treatment to high school-aged characters is a franchise first, and something that's been on the fandom's collective wish list for a very long time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a "punker granny" or a "famous streamer" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.]]></summary>

Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll soon have the chance to play EA's highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this "insider" program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title "Still working on it." The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it's going to be a blast.]]></summary>

There was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.

June 30, 2022
In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, "You will die here, and I will live forever." We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, "Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else."
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

All three of these games will be available to download for free for all three tiers of subscribers to the newly revamped PlayStation Plus – Premium, Extra, and Essential. You can add each to your library starting July 5 and they’ll be available until Aug. 1. That means you have until July 4 (next Monday) to download last month’s free games: God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. You can read more about the June 2022 PlayStation Plus lineup here. 
Enough about June, though – it’s old news! Onto July 2022! Here’s what PlayStation has to say about each of this month’s free games: 
Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan (PlayStation 4)
Arcadegeddon (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
While waiting for these games to go live, be sure to download last month’s games – God of War, Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl – and then read about the revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service to find out which new tier is right for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2020, a group of digital art smugglers lifted the National Gallery’s entire art collection, nabbing each of the 2,400 hi-res digital artworks straight from the institution’s website. Since the collection is made up of paintings long past their copyright expiration, countless works by Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Titian, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and the rest were all legally (technically) snatched up in what could have well been the biggest digital heist in art history.
The cheeky looters in question were StikiPixels, the very same team behind the art gallery sim Occupy White Walls, and now anyone who owns a PC and a copy of the game can hang these priceless paintings in their own private virtual collections. In OWW (officially pronounced Owouawwouaw if you have the time), you can build your own architecturally ambitious gallery and stuff it full of artwork.

After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I've started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I've played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you'll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it's done ours. I'll warn you now, though. It's a big list.

It's a loving send-up of The Witness, inviting us to a strange island to solve more line-drawing puzzles and listen to more audio tapes. Some of the puzzles are quite clever, and many of the jokes made me laugh—plus it's only an hour or two to complete.

All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.
As first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there's no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve's added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Round two of the Overwatch 2 beta is finally here, but what can fans look forward to with this latest tech test? Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!]]></summary>

After accusing two of his former colleagues of facilitating Chinese spying, Dotcom says that a report is being produced to show that mass infringement is taking place on Mega, a company he co-founded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn't going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, "How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?" To which I responded, "Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now." Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.]]></summary>

2017's Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game's associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle's success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

So, I sat down with the game's creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a "true adventure". Lo and behold, I think it worked!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. 
This shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. 
“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” 
This news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
According to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.

This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.

The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions & Legends. 
Azra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:
“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”
Azra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions & Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions & Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions & Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” 
Civilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. 
As Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.
Jane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. 
The Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.




Jane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel's Avengers.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-06-28T16:37:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. 
The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.
Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. 


When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. 
Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Gotham Knights exploring what life is like in a post-Bruce Wayne world, his iconic sidekick is wondering what a Robin is without a Batman. Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.


In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.
Gotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every month I throw half a dozen broken shovels at the sleeping forms lying around the RPS treehouse floor. I demand they dig a new hole for the monthly RPS Time Capsule of games we'd like to save from a certain year, and usually it isn't a problem. This time, however, the staff complained a lot about the year choice: it's 2005, baby, and they struggled. I'm okay with it though, because we ended up with a lot of cool abandonware and interesting choices I couldn't have predicted. Especially because, since I got to the Time Capsule first, I got to stuff in the most obvious choice.

The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is more of a niche prospect than its upscaler cousin DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), though it shares the same ultimate goal of making your PC games look sharper. Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

Lots of things with no end, basically. It's also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon's core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it's fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.
