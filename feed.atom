Final Fantasy VII Remake gave fans of the original game quite a shock as Cloud and the party exited Midgar. Zack, the protagonist of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a key figure in Cloud, Aerith, and Sephiroth's past, appears to be alive, and helped an injured Cloud reach Midgar. This stands in stark contrast to his fate in the original continuity, where he was killed and his Buster Sword was handed over to Cloud.

For all the brilliant aspects of retro games, the mod cons and performance we're used to now are pretty fantastic, too, and sometimes going back can be tough. Was this slowdown always here? I don't remember it looking this fuzzy. You mean I have to start again... at the beginning?!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long-time players of The Elder Scrolls series will need no introduction to Daggerfall, the second entry in Bethesda's fantasy franchise. However, if you have never played this absolute classic – albeit wholly retro-looking – RPG, now's the perfect time.


You see, the Daggerfall Unity project has finally released version 1.0 of this unofficial remake (thanks, PCGamesN), which you can download from GitHub. Intended as a more stable release of previous builds, this update represents the next stage of a recreation that's been ongoing for a few years.




Yes, some of you may scoff at the fact that this was made in the Unity engine. But you may take some comfort in knowing that it was made long before the debacle that saw the company's reputation take a nosedive.


Again, free to download


While The Elder Scrolls 2 is free to play through Steam, many would recommend the Unity version instead. It's a complete remake of the original 1996 release, done from the group up, but it doesn't lose its classic aesthetic and gameplay. It's simply been rebuilt in a different engine.


The visuals have been given a spit shine, but it still looks like a 90s DOS game. Add onto that Daggerfall Unity supporting mods, of which there are plenty to choose from, and it should make for a good time. 


While Skyrim is the one most people think of when it comes to TES, older gamers such as myself fondly recall some of the more dated installments. 


True, going back to their original iterations can be hard work on modern systems, but the Unity remake of Daggerfall is easily the definitive way to check out this legendary RPG. Especially now the full release is out. If you're at least interested, check out this rundown on changes and improvements in more detail.

An analyst has predicted that Nintendo's next console will be an iterative evolution on the current Switch and will cost $400 at launch. Oh, and it's apparently also coming this year.
Speaking via a predictions round-up over on GamesIndustry.biz, Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of game industry consultancy firm Kantan Games, has also predicted that the console's games will increase in price to $70, bringing them in line with recent gradual changes made to PS5 and Xbox games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Baldur's Gate 3 player has reportedly been banned for sharing their Xbox gameplay recording, as the footage automatically uploaded contained nude, in-game character models. 


Baldur's Gate 3 hasn't been out on the Xbox longer than a month, so this could be one of those BG3 oopsies, but it seems to come down to Xbox's own Terms of Service. Reddit user Daddy-Vegas claimed that one of his clips, fittingly named "naked camp time fun," landed him a ban lasting until the end of the year — yes, of the year that has just begun.




In an interview with DualShockers, Vegas explains that his clips were automatically shared to the Xbox public feed and that the ban occurred just a few seconds after the upload's completion. This left Vegas very little time to react to his malfeasance.


According to Vegas, he didn't intend to share the footage, but the console settings upload these by default  — you have to change the option yourself if you've got recordings that may violate ToS. The Xbox probably should not have that feature on by default or create a mature tag for this content, in case it finds it worthy of a ban. 


Naturally, players shouldn't have to worry about a ban over recordings of completely normal playthroughs of a game they'd acquired legally, but there's more. It's the old double standard of gore being fine, but looking at a naked body is a big no-no. 


And it gets even stranger


Vegas' post caused many other Xbox users to complain about similar penalties issued by Xbox, penalties that aren't even necessarily BG3 or nudity-related. Reddit user lmaoolivia talks about being banned on similar grounds when playing Attack On Titan, a game that doesn't even feature full-frontal nudity.




Destructoid has reached out to Microsoft and Larian Studios for comment, and will update this story should we hear back.

And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.
It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be the terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey.

Goodness, is it really 2024 already? Yep, hard to believe, yet here we are. As we enter the seventh year of the Switch's life cycle, a lot of eyes (including ours) are inevitably drifting toward a potential new hardware announcement in the coming months.
With many of Nintendo's first-party lineup for the year consisting of remakes and remasters, it certainly feels like we're in the 'wind down' phase of the Switch, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of games worth highlighting.

Indeed, while the announcement did specify that Sony and Polyphony Digital would "end the distribution" of purchasable DLCs and online services for Gran Turismo Sport, the expectation was that the game would remain accessible in an always-offline form. This, however, hasn't been the case, as anyone who hadn't purchased Sport before January 31, 2024, at 06:00 UTC won't be able to purchase, download, or play the game at all in the future. The community isn't thrilled about this development.

Last year I complained about Puzzmo's crossword clues being very US-centric and Excors commented that US and UK puzzles seem very different, both in their form and in the fact that UK crosswords are often crytpic. Which is true! Often if you see a "quick crossword" in a UK paper that means "crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you're waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot". So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It's way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it's just smug puns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whew! What a year it was. We saw The best Steam games of 2023 revealed – with some surprising results – countered by the tragic loss of a lot of studios and development teams. Above all, the last 12 months have shown the popularity of gaming is by no means dipping.


According to recent data from SteamDB, 14,533 games were released on the Steam platform in 2023. With the exception of 2018, we can see this number has been on the rise since the early 2000s. According to the graph, October was the busiest month, with 1,324 titles released on the platform.




Given what we can see – and providing the data is indeed accurate – we can expect this figure to rise even further throughout this new year.


Diamonds in the rough


Obviously, over 14,500 video game launches is a lot. But it's more than likely that many of these would have been obscure indie titles that perhaps didn't make much of an impact. But that's okay, the number alone shows that gaming – especially on PC – continues to be on the rise.


Actually, the indie scene did have quite an impact on the industry. The SteamDB chart shows that independent developers released a total of 6,408 games, which accounts for around 44% of all titles released last year. That and we got to see the enormous success of the likes of Lethal Company, which still holds a high position on Steam's Top Sellers (just behind Baldur's Gate 3, no less).


In short, 2023 saw a hell of a lot of video games being released on Steam. May it continue into 2024 and beyond.

Rumors about this casting popped up yesterday, January 2, with Deadline reporting that Black would play Steve (the Minecraft guy with the teal shirt and blue pants). Notably, Black starred as the villainous Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, giving us the instant-classic "Peaches," too. 
Following that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, we're all excited about GTA 6. We'd been waiting for a reveal trailer for what felt like forever. The chance to revisit Vice City in the next installment of Rockstar's Goliath franchise is something many of us are looking forward to. But there is another project that's worth keeping an eye on.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, a studio called Revolution Team is currently remaking the original Vice City, hoping to succeed where the official remaster failed. The trailer below teases what's to be expected in what's being called the Nextgen Edition.




Going off the description on YouTube, the developer is taking the 2002 Grand Theft Auto game and importing it into Rockstar's RAGE engine. More specifically, it looks as though this remake will use the GTA IV version.


No AI upscaling here, it would seem


Revolution Team acknowledges the Definitive Edition, saying that this version of Vice City will be different, i.e. better.



The official remaster uses the Unreal Engine only for rendering, but the game’s physics engine is still RenderWare, released more than 20 years ago, with outdated mechanics and animations.




The project is expected to release sometime in 2025. Here's what else you can expect in the Nextgen Edition:



• Improved version of the city from Definitive Edition
• Improved weapons from Definitive Edition
• All cars from the Xbox version of the game
• Models of all characters and peds from the Xbox version of the game (with improved textures)
• All original radio stations
• Cut scenes from the original game
• Design in the style of the original game
• Neon on buildings from Vice City Stories
• Additional fixes and improvements from the Revolution Team

Excitement because I have never played Daggerfall and it is one of the weirder, more fantastical Elder Scrolls RPGs - the one with multiple endings which sequels have explained away as somehow all being canon thanks to a metaphysical event called a Dragon Break, whereby timelines branch and reconnect. And horror because I have never played Daggerfall, which is said to be 620,000 square miles in size, and I'm getting to that point in life where I seriously ask myself whether I can finish certain games before I perish.
Still the journey is more important than reaching the destination, right? Perhaps I can treat it like an occasional walking sim.

The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket's first game. 
In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

As we mentioned a little while back, the Switch version of The Sinking City has been unaffected by the ongoing dispute since Frogwares originally published it instead of Nacon.

Originally released on Steam last September, the game sees you playing as a mouse cursor on a computer (yes, really) and setting out to help a bunny discover the truth behind its existence. Of course, this is a horror adventure, so we can expect a fair number of jumps and scares along the way — many of which can be seen in the above Steam launch trailer.

The first breakdown of physical sales in the UK for 2024 is here, with Hogwarts Legacy taking the top spot just ahead of Super Mario Bros. Wonder in the final week of 2023. According to GfK (thanks, GamesIndustry), the former is also the biggest boxed game of 2023, supplanting EA's footballing juggernaut for the first time in a decade.
You might remember that in our last UK Charts breakdown we mentioned Mario Wonder missed out on the Christmas number one. That's still technically true, but according to new GfK data, it was actually the highest-selling game on a single platform; EA Sports FC 24 beat it simply thanks to combined sales across multiple consoles. So, you could say Mario Wonder was Christmas number one and be correct... sort of.

While January isn't always the biggest month on the video game calender, this year there are already several games to look forward to. One of these is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - a new Metroidvania-style take on the classic platforming series.
If you're wondering just how much bang for your buck you'll be able to get from this one, according to Game Informer, this new adventure is estimated to be roughly 25 hours. It's not entirely clear if this is just the main game or a completionist run. However, the length of each playthrough depends on player skill and the amount of exploration.

        <updated>2024-01-02T22:38:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term "late" has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, "the timing was incorrect and has since been amended." So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.
Original story:
Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, "And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year."
Star Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.
For more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-02T22:12:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney dropped a blog post today teasing what the House of Mouse has in store for fans across the next 12 months. Among the things the company reaffirmed was that Star Wars Outlaws is indeed coming this year.


Oddly though, when the blog was initially published, it specifically stated "late 2024" as the release window for Outlaws. However, a few hours later, the post was updated to remove "late" and now simply lists 2024. 


A lot to explore in 2024. 


Nothing was really shared on the project other than a vague summation.  The blog simply teased that players will "explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new." 


We were first introduced to the game when Ubisoft unveiled it during Xbox's 2023 Games Showcase. Set in the time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Outlaws revolves around the underground world of the franchise. You play as an outlaw scoundrel by the name of Kay Vess as she attempts a massive heist alongside her companion, Nix. 


Developed by Massive Entertainment, the title features a variety of different forms of gameplay. While it's primarily a third-person action-adventure project, you'll also encounter stealth, vehicular combat, space combat, and more.


The "late 2024" designation may have been removed from Disney's blog, but it's still probably safe to assume that's the targeted window for Outlaws at this point. For whatever reason, Disney and Ubisoft must just not be ready to formally list the game's release date as such. Regardless, there's little doubt we'll be seeing much more of Star Wars Outlaws in the near future.

This brings to an end several years of uncertainty and litigation, which saw the Lovecraftian RPG delisted from Steam several times and at one point restored by its publisher via an allegedly pirated version of the game. 

The downside is that an updated version of the game is coming to all storefronts in the coming weeks and it won't be compatible with old save files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would be easy to say that Final Fantasy XVI: Echoes of the Fallen is just more Final Fantasy XVI. See, it's so easy, I just said it right there. And that’s about 90% of what you need to know about this DLC.


Granted, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I generally feel grated by DLC that’s kind of slapped haphazardly onto a game without a lot of thought, and that’s not the case with Echoes of the Fallen. Instead, Echoes of the Fallen functions as a neat bonus endgame quest that culminates in the game's closest equivalent to a superboss. I didn’t necessarily find Final Fantasy XVI lacking for content, but I really like how integrated into the game this DLC is. A totally new player wouldn't even know this was content added after the fact if the game didn't announce it!


That said, is Echo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an official blog post, Blizzard confirmed the next update for World of Warcraft: Dragonflight will drop on January 16. Titled Seeds of Renewal, the update brings a handful of new content to the popular MMORPG as well as concludes the current storyline campaign of the Dragon Isles.

Worldwide Dragonriding and Azerothian Archives and more


One of the most popular mechanics introduced in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight is Dragonriding. Currently, the feature is only accessible in the new expansion area, the Dragon Isles.  However, with the Seeds of Renewal update, Dragonriding is being expanded to be useable in all old-world continents where flying is available which includes most of Azeroth.


A new system is also being added called the Azerothian Archives. Players will have the chance to deliver into the history and lore of the Dragon Isles and explore an iconic time before the expansion over Weekly Public Events at the Traitor's Rest. Solo and Group activities will be available and reward players with Battle Pets, Mounts, and a Transmog set.


Fans of Worgens and Genn Greymane, the King of Gilneas, will be happy to see the King finally attempt to reclaim the kingdom of Gilneas in the Seeds of Renewal update. Gilneas has long been abandoned after being invaded by the Forsaken and then ripped asunder by the Cataclysm in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion. Players will have the opportunity to aid King Greymane in retaking Gilneas.


Finally, Follower Dungeons are being added in the Seeds of Renewal update as well. Players can enlist the help of NPC companions to clear through dungeons instead of doing so with other players. All eight Normal Dragonflight Dungeons will now automatically scale and fill between 1-4 AI players, with more dungeons to come in the future.


The World of Warcraft 10.2.5 Seeds of Renewal update is set to launch on January 16.

Focusing on technical rendering solutions as of late, Durante has now set his sights on a new kind of local multiplayer gaming.


More specifically, Durante's latest blog post, titled "A New Approach to Local Multiplayer / Splitscreen Perspective With Raytracing," goes in-depth on Thoman's idea of leveraging raytracing to develop a new kind of hotseat multiplayer screen-sharing experience. Historically, hotseat games have relied on one of several different types of split-screen implementations. A prominent example comes from racing games such as Gran Turismo, for one, where each player is allotted either one-half or one-quarter of the scr…]]></summary>

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.
That game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time. Though not completely ignored, thanks to the occasional cameo in other Ubisoft games and underplayed mobile releases, w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”


Cain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consumer Softproducts’ follow-up to 2021’s shared fever dream, Cruelty Squad, is now listed on Steam. Psycho Patrol R is now available for wishlisting, though there is no announced release window.


I had noticed Consumer Softproducts tinkering around with a mech game since the release of Cruelty Squad, but with such things, sometimes an end result is never seen. However, it’s looking more likely with the official name and fancy store page.


Psycho Patrol R has you play as a federal police officer of the eponymous Psycho Patrol. You’re tasked with piloting a V-Stalker to solve “mental crime, among other things.” It bills itself as a “combination of high-intensity tactical FPS combat” and takes place in an open, non-linear world. You’re also able to customize the equipment on your stompy V-Stalker, which I think is an unwritten law in the world of mech games. It also appears that you will be spending some time outside of your robot womb and can engage in thrilling conversations about cryptocurrency with executives.


Right now, it looks like Psycho Patrol R will tone down the garish and nauseatingly surreal colors of Cruelty Squad, but the game’s graphics still scream jank-pop. I think I might have been disappointed if it didn’t.


I reviewed Cruelty Squad back in 2021. I called out its deliberately stilted gameplay, referring to it as “a purposeful desecration of the holy grounds of game design.” That was one of the first times I was quoted on Wikipedia, but the phrase was eventually expunged from the article to make room for more favorable acclamations. I meant it as a compliment. Cruelty Squad has been living in my brain ever since and is probably the source of trauma that has driven me into the arms of similar jank-pop titles.


Psycho Patrol R is currently set for release on PC, though no release window has been stated.

        <id>https://www.destructoid.com/?p=445233</id>
        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/square-enix-plans-to-expand-use-of-generative-ai-in-2024-according-to-company-president/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=square-enix-plans-to-expand-use-of-generative-ai-in-2024-according-to-company-president"/>
        <updated>2024-01-02T16:12:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a New Year’s letter, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu plans to be “aggressive in applying” generative AI to their “content development and publishing functions” going forward.


Kiryu doesn’t really get specific about their intended uses for AI beyond that, merely spending a couple of paragraphs extolling the potential of the relatively new technology. He says, “I believe that generative AI has the potential not only to reshape what we create, but also to fundamentally change the processes by which we create, including programming.”


If you’re not familiar with Square Enix’s New Year’s messages, they have previously been undersigned by former president Yosuke Matsuda. They have, for the past couple of years, delved into the company’s intentions with Web 3.0, NFTs, blockchain, and the Metaverse. Square Enix even went as far as selling off Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal to Embracer Group to help fund their investment in those technologies.


Considering this letter is meant to ring in the New Year after one that was rife with job losses and layoffs, it’s pretty bold to talk about AI. While the letter says nothing about an intention to replace employee processes with the technology, when the topic of the benefits of generative AI comes up, it usually involves the automation of roles. It’s tone-deaf to bring it up as a positive direction when the roles of artists and software engineers are often considered vulnerable to replacement by the technology.


So, in the spirit of that callousness, I feel it’s appropriate to bring up that a not-insignificant portion of executives have stated that their own jobs could be replaced by AI.


On the other hand, it can be perceived as amusing to hear Square Enix say this sort of thing – even bringing up text-based dialogue – when their previous experiments with such a thing went hilariously awry.

I am! 2023 gave us a ton of great games to play, but we also had a lot of bad gaming industry news dropping steadily throughout. Hopefully, this year will bring better tidings as some of the sectors recover and come back stronger.


In the meantime, here's a quick recap of what's been happening on the Switch eShop for the past few weeks. Studios pushed out everything they could at a rapid pace before the holiday, just as users unwrap their new Switches and redeem their eShop gift card money. After that things slowed down to a crawl, with only eight total games coming out the week of December 28 through January 3.

The topline: they want to do more with generative "AI" machine learning tools,  and they're still dead keen on metaversy VR/AR stuff. The blockchain remains a "focus", too, though it gets much less of a billing than in 2023's new year letter from Square Enix’s previous president Yosuke Matsuda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though the studio remains forever secretive, Kojima Productions has been gracious enough to provide fans a sneak peek into two upcoming projects: the Death Stranding sequel and OD. On Twitter, Hideo Kojima recently gave an update on Death Stranding 2's development. 


He explains that 2024 entails another year of development for the game which is being produced at the same time as OD. Death Stranding 2 still "has some ADR left" and after that, the studio will focus on doing Japanese voice-overs. There's still no official release date for Death Stranding 2, but with Kojima discussing "another year of development," a 2025 launch wouldn't be out of the question.

A busy year for Kojima Productions


During The Game Awards 2023, Kojima spoke a bit about OD which is described as a title that will defy expectations and expand the medium. He's enlisted the help of movie-maker Jordan Peele, and we've received a cryptic teaser trailer, though we're still stuck without a release date.




Although Kojima intends to limit his business trips this year, he's still busy turning Death Stranding into a movie, collaborating on the Avengers, and working on OD in addition to other video projects. He also mentions a writing project along with the possible revival of Hide Radio and "a special program on 'HideTube'."




It appears it's a busy year ahead for Kojima Productions, but we may see the fruits of the studio's labor soon. Plenty of the upcoming projects intrigue me, but I'm particularly interested to see how Death Stranding's movie adaptation will be handled. Although the game is teeming with lengthy cutscenes, it'll be a tall task to capture the unique atmosphere established by the gameplay.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of EarthBound (known in Japan as Mother 2) and, according to the official X (formerly Twitter) page, plans are in place to celebrate the hefty milestone (thanks, My Nintendo News).
What these plans are, exactly, is up in the air at the moment, but we're not expecting anything earth-shattering. After all, Earthbound itself is already playable on Switch via the Nintendo Switch Online service, and we're way beyond anticipating any official Western release of its sequel, Mother 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy new year all. What's the weather like where you are? We've got Amber and Yellow warnings in London - I do not understand what these terms mean, but I'm going to add a Sapphire warning for escalating Maw activity. The creature was pretty lively over the Xmas weekend, but Graham managed to soothe it with posts about gaming-related new year resolutions and, of all things, the Spike Video Game Awards. We can expect the Maw's petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.
Some new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I've just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder contains all sorts of hidden secrets and surprises, but there were also a lot of ideas left on the cutting room floor.
As highlighted by producer Takashi Tezuka during a chat with Famitsu last week, there was a point during the game's development when the team considered Yoshi's egg-throwing mechanic. Ultimately, the concept "became hard to control" and Nintendo didn't want to isolate new players.

Japanese video game creator Shigeru Miyamoto isn't getting any younger, so what exactly are his plans regarding retirement?
The Guardian recently asked the Nintendo legend if he was "ever tempted" to call time on his outstanding career and although he's been at the company since its arcade era, he's apparently got "no plans to do so". He's more focused on the future of the company and the scenario where he needs to "pass things on" to someone.

I own more of the Famicom titles, but I wasn’t planning on making a thing of Pachio-Kun. It was fun to spit facts about the Japanese gambling industry, but I couldn’t possibly do that for multiple articles. But then I got the Analogue Duo.


When reviewing it, I wanted to get disc-based games to test, so I ordered a bunch from Japan. They didn’t arrive in time. In fact, they arrived mere hours after my review went live. Typical. I was looking for cheap games and came across two Pachio-Kun titles that confused me. Why does a pachinko game have cutscenes, I wondered. W…]]></summary>

Switch, eh? You think it's had its final bookend game and then another all-timer comes along to extend the library. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom looked like the perfect finale for an extraordinary console that kicked off with Breath of the Wild, but then Nintendo goes and puts out the best 2D Mario in 30 years with Super Mario Wonder. And between those and continuing into 2024, you've got fantastic games like Pikmin 4, Super Mario RPG, and (hopefully) the upcoming Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake extending the bookshelf even further. It's a heck of a console with an extraordinary library that Just. Keeps. Going.

Final Fantasy VII is full of iconic scenes. Whether you're talking about the well-known sequences already depicted in Remake or the upcoming gut-punch at the Forgotten Capital, the Remake trilogy allows fans to experience these moments in their most fully realized forms. While this middle portion of Final Fantasy VII, which Rebirth depicts, focuses on Aerith and the looming specter of Sephiroth, so much of Rebirth's depiction emphasizes the deepening of relationships.
This is true with how the developers approached both the main story and side content in Rebirth, and it's sure to make it so …]]></summary>

At least, that’s what it feels like the game industry is increasingly saying I should do. A number of recently revealed titles have been slapped with 2025 release windows, so I can’t help but wonder how next year will shape up and, most importantly, what the awards seasons will look like.  
There are still hundreds of games yet to fill the 2025 release calendar, but let’s pretend they won’t exist. Let’s say 95% of the game industry collectively decided to take a year off. Making games is obscenely hard, and to avoid crunch, everyone decided to take some well-deserved (and well-compensated) R&R, so these seven titles are the only ones to launch in 2025.

Store shelves were crowded with poorly made games, and consumer interest waned substantially. Developers that ushered in the “golden age” of arcades and the first two generations of home consoles began to crash and burn at an alarming pace. In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.
In the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges. With its striking red and gold design, the Family Computer, better known as the Famicom, brought arcade hits like Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. into Japanese homes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fate/Samurai Remnant, the latest entry in the Fate franchise, will receive the first of three DLCs soon, and it will arrive in February 2024. 


Titled Record’s Fragment: Keian Command Championship, details on what to expect are still sparse. The trailer depicts Gilgamesh the King of Heroes announcing that he has seized control of the fates of several characters from the base game. He then announces the start of the Keian Command Championship.  




Two more DLCs are on the way, but they've yet to be named or receive a release date, although they are to launch in 2024. Each of the DLCs will bring additional scenarios, new Servants, stages, and more. If you want access to all the extra content, a Season Pass is available which also comes with the Hallowed Relic Sword Mountings bonus. 


I enjoyed my time with Fate/Samurai Remnant, so the DLC piques my interest. Perhaps the only downside is that it comes during a time that already promises to be packed with enticing titles like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Persona 3 Reload.

One deal that caught our eye this morning is this deal on a Gigabyte RTX 4070 Windforce 3X OC model, which is down to £530.58 when bought from Amazon US via Amazon UK. 
The deal price, which includes shipping and import duty, is significantly cheaper than UK-based options from major GPU makers which are in the £560 to £600 range. However, there are cheaper UK options if you're happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance.

That might be because I've not had a huge amount of time to play loads outside of review duties and general life things, but there's only been, like, less than a handful of games that have truly commanded my attention.
One of said games comes backflipping in right at the tailend of this year: Astral Ascent. It's a 2D roguelike in the vein of Dead Cells, where you battle through stages, power-up, try and get as far as you can, inevitably die, reinvest your winnings, power-up permanently, then go again. It saddens me that I've not seen much excitement for the game elsewhere, so here I am with a little pudding for you. A little treat. Here comes the plane, nyaaaooownnn.

Plus a couple others that came out of early access in 2023 but which I sadly don't have time to write about in full. Trust me, The Last Spell and Against The Storm are both phenomenal games as well.
Anyway: in this handsomely decorated selection box, you'll find four of my honourable mentions for games I've enjoyed playing the most this year. If you have a hole in your Steam library, maybe these will help fill it over the Christmas break!

Probably something like 70% of my 2023 games time was spent on precisely two co-op shooters, neither of which I’ve written about much, nor were new enough to be eligible for the most recent Advent Calendar. I apparently have a type. I’m sorry.
Still, while the man’s rules prevent me from recommending Deep Rock Galactic or Darktide, I do have a few picks that fell short of full Advent Calendar glory. And they’re all... colourful, quite short indie platformers? Hmm, maybe I have two types.

According to TrueAchievements, after calculating the cost of each new game on Xbox Game Pass, the total amounted to nearly $9000.


With big releases like Starfield and Hi-Fi Rush, there was no shortage of new games for subscribers to dig into. Clearly, Xbox Game Pass was committed to being the best gaming service, bringing in huge third-party titles and inventive indies. As for the savings, the exact amounts are listed below:

However, in retrospect, this is partially due to me getting it confused with Don Doko Don, a 1989 arcade game in Taito’s single-screen format. If I knew what I was thinking about, I’d be even more excited.


Hammerin’ Harry is a port of Irem’s 1990 arcade game, which was called Daiku no Gen-san: Beranme-chō Sōdōki in Japan. While Irem is perhaps best remembered for their R-Type series, their back catalog is built from an extremely colorful mix of titles on both arcade and consoles. There are a lot of underappreciated greats like Undercover Cops and Gekisha Boy which, to be fair, are largely unknown in the West because they were never localized.

And through it all, the RPS guides team has been quietly toiling away, appeasing The Beast That Is Google with medium-rare slabs of SEO meat, and providing the answers to oft-asked gaming questions.
It's important to me to have a moment in the year where we can step into the light for a little bit and celebrate everything the guides team has accomplished this year. Usually we stay well out of the spotlight, because people only like seeing guides if they're actively searching for it. But today, we're staging a coup. We're taking centre stage, and threatening the lighting technician with all manner of disagreeable bodily experiences unless they keep the spotlight fixed firmly on us for the duration of this post.
2023 has been an amazing standout year for guides. Let's take a look at the games that have defined the year for us, and celebrate some of the fantastic work our team has published.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The year 2023 is coming to a close. And as time carries on into the new year, we've got even more games to fill our endless backlogs, ranging from small surprises to our most anticipated known launches.


Really, 2024 is already shaping up to another big year for games. Right off the bat in the first quarter, we'll see RPG fans eating well with the likes of Infinite Wealth, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Dragon's Dogma 2, and Persona 3 Reload.




Princess Peach gets to take the stage, and Ubisoft might deliver a bit of a surprise with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Also, we'll (probably) see the launch of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Skull and Bones. That's just in the span of January to March!


But what are we looking forward to, here at Destructoid? We've put together a li…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of every year, gamers are faced with an undeniable fact: far too many video games are released in a 12-month span for anyone to reasonably play them all. It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.
“You've never played this?”
I understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…]]></summary>

It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. 
Between big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development. Here are the 10 biggest gaming news…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The increasing use of AI in gaming draws ambivalent responses. While some appreciate it when used in the right context, others complain that it lacks the artistic flair that only humans can bring. Date Ariane’s creator, Ariane Barnes, has been warning of the possible harms of AI in gaming all year, and it hasn’t stopped in December.


For the uninitiated, Date Ariane is a classic game that launched in 2004 and has gone on to be highly influential in the realm of adult visual novels. It has a simple premise - go on a date with Ariane and ensure it ends on a sexual note. It’s still available, has received remasters, and the creator has released other visual novels in the same vein.


In a blog released this month, she describes 2023 as the year of the rise and fall of AI, claiming that “in l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've mentioned elsewhere that I played a lot of huge games this year, both literally referring to their size, and metaphorically referring to their brand name awareness (I had great intentions of doing a long-running Starfield diary, where I visited every planet I could until I got demoralised by the project, but unfortunately that turned out to be the length of one entry). I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023. I am very pleased with the shape of our Advent Calendar this year, though, especially the mid-table, which has some good weirdo entries and some surprises there.
So I thought I'd struggle to come up with three reminders for you for the Selection Box. And yet I didn't! They're also very on brand. Words and murder you say? Maybe in 2024 I should make a resolution to switch things up a bit. Gotta keep you guessing, dear readers...

It's only four episodes long, but it offers a unique slice-of-life perspective of the franchise which may be enough to rekindle the flame of passion for the franchise in even the most disillusioned fans. 


The episodes are about fifteen minutes each, so you'll be done with all of them in about an hour. They're best binged sequentially, and though each episode is mostly self-contained, they all have the same relaxed vibe that makes watching the series an incredibly calming experience. 


The first episode introduces you to the protagonist, Haru, who's not having the best time in her personal life, so she heads over to the Pokemon Resort to reinvent herself as a concierge. She's expecting…]]></summary>

Microsoft announced in January of 2022 that it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, the largest video game acquisition ever. After nearly two years of Stateside court cases with the federal government, appeals and appeasements across the pond, unprecedented document leaks, direct arguments from rivals like PlayStation, and more, the deal is complete: Xbox is home to all 19 of Activision Blizzard’s studios (and King’s 11 mobile game development st…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve have put together their "Best Of 2023" lists on Steam. This is different from the Steam Awards, voting for which is ongoing, and instead is built from Steam data like revenue, peak concurrent players, and so on. It's interesting every year as older games or indie obscurities do better than you expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than six years after the original Persona 5 arrived on U.S. store shelves, the RPG is still spitting out successors and spin-offs that capitalize on how beloved that title is to this day. The 2020 update, Persona 5 Royal, is the best-received successor, but both 2021 Musou hybrid Persona 5 Strikers and the recently released turn-based strategy RPG Persona 5 Tactica gave players plenty to love.
Among the reasons players love those games are the new additions to the cast. Each of those aforementioned titles gives the core Phantom Thieves new characters with whom to interact. Royal gave us Kasumi and Maruki, Strikers gave us Sophia and Zenkichi, and most recently, Tactica gave us Erina and Toshiro. With chemistry serving such an important role for the casts of these games, bringing in ne…]]></summary>

While the majority will be ones that most of you will be expecting, there are a couple of surprises in there. Or at least that's what I think.


You can see the full list of top grossing games of 2023 on the Steam website, which splits it into categories going from platinum to bronze, depending on overall sales. There are also different lists for best Steam Deck games, most played, best VR releases, and more.




As for the overall top sellers on the platform, the likes of Hogwarts Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 were surefire winners. It's also nice to see Sons of the Forest in the platinum category. Hype for the indie horror game may have died down, but it selling two …]]></summary>

Obsidian's Josh Sawyer was right when he called it an "embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power". Yet I still can't help but also see the Game Awards as something else: a sign of progress. That's because I remember the Spike Video Game Awards from 2007, which remains the nadir of both the games industry specifically and popular culture in general.

While I've only slapped one Bestest Best badge down in 2023 (woe is me), our lovely freelancers, current RPSers, and former RPSers have done a whole lot more badge-slapping. A grand total of 26 Bestest Bests have graced our monitors this year, which makes it three more than last year's Bestest Best round-up. And I'd say it's a nice mixture of big budget open worlders, puzzle gems, and indie delights that make up our roster for 2023, too.
So yeah, I'd encourage you to have a flick through the list below and see if there's anything you can add to the wishlist. Even as the person with "Reviews" in their job title, I can confirm I literally have loads of these Bestest Bests in my backlog. I will endeavour to play a handful over this Christmas break on my Steam Deck, maybe combining the experience with a nibble on a mince pie. Anyway, enjoy! And Merry Reviewsmas!

I thought I was at 68, so I was trying to figure out how to fit one more in. But it turns out that OpenCritic is missing one, and poorer for it.


What are we here for? Right. My favorite games this year, in no particular order.


It is always hard for me to put year-end lists together because I can barely remember what I played last month. That’s it. There’s no “but” to that statement. Okay, roll the, uh… article.

The larger industry and its members will always look back on 2023 with justified frustration.
Patterns in any year are always a given. Trends inspire entire genres to be prevalent, and we also have events like 2009, where there were two high-profile open-world games about super-powered humans: Infamous and Prototype. This year will certainly be remembered for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3, among others, but I can’t help but notice that RPGs citing a specific era of the genre were also, inexplicably, hugely popular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2024 is right around the corner, and what better way to kick it off than to get some complimentary games from your PlayStation Plus subscription? As announced in the PS Blog, this month's selection of games is headlined by A Plague Tale: Requiem, Asobo Studio's 2022 tale of sickness and siblings. While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, "Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic." You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.
The other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, "Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish."D All three games will be available to download on January 2.
And as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.
Are you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The annual CES conference showcases what new tech and ideas companies have been working on. Next year's event will be held on January 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. Sony has confirmed it'll be there, and you'll be able to watch its presentation streamed on its official YouTube channel at 05:00 PM PST. 


Described as one of the world's largest technology events, you'll want to keep an eye on CES to see what game-changing tech is coming our way. This could range from televisions to cameras and other electronics produced by the tech world. 


This year, Sony aims to focus on the company's purpose which is to "fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology." The company has yet to reveal what's in store, though it has revealed that it will be joined by Sony Honda Mobility. 


In its announcement of its attendance, the company looks back at its past attendance at the event. It appeared at CES for the first time in June 1977, and since then it has showcased plenty of new technology during its presentations, including the "world's first CD player." Since then, the company gradually shifted its approach to the event, and it is now concerned with "introducing its latest technologies and initiatives that support creators."


You should be warned that this event is not centered on PlayStation, and it is only one of Sony's several ventures. Nevertheless, past CES events have brought us some interesting gaming news. In 2023, we got a look at Sony's accessibility controller which launched on December 6, while in 2022 we got a glimpse of the PS VR2 which hit shelves in February this year.  


CES 2024 is set to be another packed event filled with exhibitors hoping to show off their latest advancements. According to the event organizer, there will be over 150 companies represented. Companies that have confirmed their attendance include Samsung, Lenovo, and Intel to name a few.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't have much time to play new games this year, honestly. Prior to joining the RPS Treehouse in late October, I spent much of the year organising a massive international move with my family from the US to the UK, which meant that many of 2023's fresh releases - aside from the few that I've highlighted in this year's advent calendar - remained in the unplayed depths of my Steam list. Now that it's December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box. After much deliberation, I realised that there were a few indie gems that I managed to crack open amidst all the chaos of arranging 60+ boxes for shipment across the Atlantic.

The hybrid console received critically acclaimed exclusives like Pikmin 4, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Super Mario RPG. Recently, Nintendo revealed the top 30 most downloaded games on Japan's eShop in 2023. 


The list doesn't come with too many surprises, although if you haven't been paying attention, it may be unexpected to see Pikmin 4 clinching third place. It didn't cause too much of a splash in the West, but Famitsu lists reveal that it has been selling well in Japan. It may also be a shock to see that Tears of the Kingdom isn't in the number one spot and sits in second place instead. 


That's because Suika Game takes first place, a game that has accumulated over 5 million downloads worldwide. The whole top 30 list …]]></summary>

By the end of his journey through Silent Hill, everything will be chaos – his mind and even the world around him, a violent cacophony of anguish.
But in the beginning, it’s silent. The kind of quiet that’s deafening, where you hear your pulse in your ears, and every tiny sound becomes the worst thing you can imagine.
Includes spoilers for Silent Hill 2
The opening hour of Silent Hill 2 is – without question – the scariest thing I have ever played. Which, taken at face value, might seem a bit ridiculous. Your goal is simply to navigate James through a dilapidated apartment building. At most, you’ll face 10 enemies throughout the building’s three floors, but they hardly pose a threat; they’re easily avoided or killed. Gameplay primarily consists…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve has released its annual "Best Of" list highlighting the top-performing games on Steam measured by gross revenue and player engagement.
The categories are top sellers, best-selling new releases, most-played games on PC, most-played games on Steam Deck, highest-grossing early access games, most-played using a controller, and best-selling VR titles. The top 12 games in each category earn Platinum status, while everything below them is grouped into a descending ranking of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. It's a fun snapshot of the games Steam users dug into most this year and a reminder that games seemingly on the downtrend or long in the tooth (like, say, Destiny 2) clearly have a lot of players still logging in to play.

In 2020, Final Fantasy VII Remake greatly expanded his role in the first act of the beloved RPG, and in 2024, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hopes to give us even more context for the One-Winged Angel. We played a portion of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and spoke with several members of the development team to learn how Sephiroth is depicted in the upcoming second act of the Remake trilogy.

Sick of your family, sick of leftovers, wondering if the day after Boxing Day is still excuse enough to eat two dozen After Eights for dinner, your mind might start to slip towards the future. 2024! What all could you achieve with a whole twelve months stretched out before you? 

You could finally learn piano, you could re-commit yourself to bouldering, you could finally scratch out that novel. Or maybe you could just play a lot of video games. That's no less noble a pursuit. So what is your video game resolution for 2024?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has once again fallen to me to pick out my favourite features, this time from 2023. This is a terrible task, because there are always a lot I like. I've tried to cut it down a bit from last year, for both our sakes, dear reader, and decided that previews don't count (because as a format previews do a lot of the work for you, to be honest). Even reducing my task this way made it tough to whittle things down, and I'm sure I've missed some excellent articles and writers - and that I will be corrected in the comments!
Still, read on for a place to start if you want to look back at the year that was on RPS. We've got interviews, community nonsense, and even more interviews for you to enjoy here. I think in 2024 I'm going to advocate for more horseposting.

When you think of pirates, history mainstays like Blackbeard might come to mind alongside the fictional Jack Sparrow. An important but often forgotten name, however, is Cheng Shih. Not only is Cheng Shih one of history's most successful pirates, but she's also the woman who took over her late husband Zheng Yi Sao's pirate armada after his death, putting her in indirect control of 40,000-plus pirates for a nearly decade-long stint in Chinese waters in the early 19th Century. While Cheng Shih's story can be found on pages of books and elsewhere, Singer Studios aims to bring her story to life in VR.

It's Kuma's turn now, and the fighting bear is embearrassing challengers left and right.
Sporting a sweet headband and rugged gi, Kuma looks to be an unbearably challenging opponent. His furious paw swipes show he has no problem bearing arms, even against his perennial crush, Panda. In fact, she could bearly stand up to him! But don’t take my word for it. Bear witness to Kuma’s grizzly carnage by watching the trailer below. 


Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check out our recent hands-on preview of the game's story mode here.]]></summary>

Playing a giant timesink game all day hasn't appealed as I've sought to spend more time in forests and up hills and down rivers, and Destiny 2 burned me out so hard on live service games that I still can't face those.

Anyone?

Uh. I think I've been locked inside the treehouse while the others left on their Christmas holidays, so I guess I may as well continue to write the news. Deathloop is currently free to keep for those with an Amazon Prime membership.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Final Fantasy X exploded onto the PlayStation 2 in 2001, it revolutionized not just the Final Fantasy series but the role-playing genre as a whole. The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.
For Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map's disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. "We started off expressi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's December 26, which means Christmas has come and gone, and other seasonal holidays are underway while we all wait for the new year to kick off next week. Everyone knows that the days between your winter holiday and New Year's Eve are for gaming, right? At least, we hope you're doing some gaming today, tomorrow, and the day after! Or maybe you're kicking back with a good book, or watching a new movie?


We don't know what it is you're doing but we want to! In fact, we want to know what video game presents you found under the tree or in a beautifully wrapped gift box this year, too.
Did you get a new console? Did you get some games to add to your never-ending backlog – we're all still catching up on 2023's frankly absurd gauntlet of releases, right? Did you get some cool shirts, some Fortnite V-bucks, or a new coffee cup with Clive from Final Fantasy XVI on it?
Whatever it is you got, we want to know so drop a line in the comments below! And if this year's gifts weren't video game-themed, tell us what your favorite gift was anyway! 
On behalf of everyone here at Game Informer, we hope the holidays are treating you well (and we hope you're getting through that backlog for the sake of 2024's release schedule).]]></summary>

This is on top of the toolset allowing anyone to make and publish their own games within Fortnite.
The whole thing was kind of weird.
Not that any of the experiences are bad – the Lego thing is super not for me, but I really like the racing game (made by Psyonix, developer of Rocket League), and I think the music element has the potential to become something interesting down the road. 
I'm just not so sure Epic's utopian vision of Fortnite as this everything app makes sense. I agree with the idea that Fortnite is a great social tool – but only in the way most online video games can…]]></summary>

It was a challenging year for the industry as a whole, but in terms of artistic output, 2023 is absolutely a contender.

However, the year's game release calendar was so much more than just those 10 games. Below, you'll see our winners for various categories, allowing us to celebrate a wide range of games, moments, characters, and elements from the extremely strong year for game releases.

We got a 2023 release window alongside a new trailer back in 2022, but the mod needed more time, missing a release this year. Now, Team FOLON has revealed Fallout: London will be released in April, as reported by Eurogamer. 
More specifically, it will be available on April 23, 2024. The team announced this date in a new developer update released on December 23. In it, the team shows off more of the work it's done since its last trailer, highlighting well-worn and lesser-known locales of London alongside enemies, weapons, and more. It ends with the April 23, 2024, release date announcement.

It's also perhaps no surprise that in the big spreadsheet of games I've played this year, I've set yet another new record for things I've played to completion. At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you're reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn't be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That's more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I'm so chuffing tired right now.
In any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I've taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid’s Master Collection was a fairly underwhelming package of some of the greatest video games ever made when it released back in October. While official updates since then have done little to address some of its most egregious problems - leaving modders to step in, as usual - the game’s latest patch has finally offered up a decent serving of improvements direct from the source.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bahnsen Knights knows what not to tell you. Its world is largely a mystery, because all that matters is the situation its protagonist Boulder is stuck way, way too deep in. Everything feels like it's about to come to a head somehow, even though you have very little idea what's going on.
Its world could almost be a post-apocalypse one, a feeling that persists even though it's unclear how true it is, how much is ambient cult brainwashing, and how much just the result of Boulder starting to lose himself after being undercover for far too long.

Social media users have been playing the stolen build and posting videos, which range from early tutorial sequences to story scenes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hear ye! This month marked the 25th birthday of Thief: The Dark Project. While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.


Notable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest? One of Thief’s original designers, Daniel Thron, joined The Black Parade’s team – and simultaneously released a new Thief short film, featuring the original game’s voice actors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, ransomware group Rhysida released more than a terabyte of data it illegally obtained by hacking Marvel's Spider-Man 2 developer, Insomniac Games. The hacked data comprised of more than 1.3 million files, for a total of 1.67 terabytes of data, including information about Marvel's Wolverine, future Insomniac Games titles, release schedules, private employee information like tax and employment forms, internal studio messages, and more.
Insomniac has now publicly addressed the hack in a new statement, stating that development on Marvel's Wolverine will continue as planned.

December 22, 2023
Here's what the studio said, in full: 
Last week, Rhysida revealed it had hacked Insomniac Games, posting images to prove the validity of its claim and demanding 50 bitcoin – roughly $2 million – from Somy within seven days or it would release what it had discovered. Sony did not comply with the demand and the ransomware group released 1.67 terabytes of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac. 
Insomniac just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here. The studio revealed Marvel's Wolverine back in 2021, revealing this year that the game takes place in the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Park: Snow Day, the upcoming four-player cooperative adventure first announced in August, is coming on March 26. A new trailer shows off more of the game’s frosty action and, of course, the series’ signature foul-mouth humor.
As the New Kid, players join Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny on an epic quest after a blizzard blankets the Colorado town, and school is canceled. Like the most recent South Park titles, The Stick of Truth and The Fractured But Whole, the adventure is told through the lens of a make-believe high-fantasy adventure, but Snow Day ditches turn-based combat in favor of a more action-oriented experience. 


Players can use different melee and ranged weapons, wield magic and other abilities, and customize their character with various clothing. Snow Day can be played with up to four friends, alongside strangers in online matchmaking, or as a solo experience with A.I. allies. 
South Park: Snow Day is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-22T13:59:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fntastic announced earlier this month that it would be closing down, just days after launching its controversial game, The Day Before. It said at the time that servers for The Day Before would remain in operation but that the game's future was unknown. Now, the studio has announced that it has officially ceased operations and The Day Before's servers will be turned off next month. 
More specifically, the servers will be turned off on January 22, 2024. While the game has an emphasis on online play, it could still be played offline. However, on December 12, five days after the game launched on Steam, it was pulled from the storefront and The Day Before hasn't been available for purchase since. Plus, Fntastic says the game will be "retired." 
pic.twitter.com/GIX4ZAztny
December 22, 2023
Here's Fntastic's full statement on the server closure: 
The Day Before launched into Early Access on December 7. The game peaked at 38,104 concurrent users at launch on Steam but today, that number is down to 55 players, according to SteamDB. In those four days, The Day Before also received enough negative reviews from players to place it into the 10 worst-reviewed games on Steam. 
Over the years, The Day Before has been the subject of controversy, ranging from requests for volunteer work, various delays, broken promises, and more. Fntastic has scrubbed its entire YouTube channel, leaving the following note as its channel's description: "We're grateful to everyone who supported us during these difficult years. It's been a fantastic journey over the past eight years." 
[Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Fntastic's statement said, "Steam will not proactively refund all remaining players." The statement says, "Steam will now proactively refund all remaining players" and the story has been updated to reflect that. Game Informer regrets this mistake.]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Contact Entertainment, the team behind VR games like 2018's Firewall: Zero Hour and this year's Firewall Ultra on PSVR 2, has announced it is closing, as reported by Gematsu. After almost eight years as a studio, it will shut down at the end of the year. It cites a lack of VR support within the industry. 


"After almost eight years of working with the most amazing team I've ever had the pleasure of being part of, I'm sad to announce that we will be closing our company First Contact Entertainment by the end of the year," a Facebook post from the company reads. "The lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll. As a AAA VR game developer, we are just not able to justify the expenses needed going forward. 
"We are a team of fearless innovators willing to push new technologies to its limits. I am extremely proud of the team and grateful to our investors, our partners and of course, our community of dedicated and passionate players. It's been a wild ride. Thank you."

First, the approach: having exited a vast pine forest of primeval aspect and supernatural disposition, with distant, daylit clearings leading the eye deeper and deeper into the undergrowth, till it feels at last as though your gaze has become tangibly enmeshed with clutching root and lowering branch - having finally escaped from that terrible, terrible forest, with its single, mournful stream crossed by a bridge of predatory bareness that is surely a haven for trolls, you set out across a grey and purple oblivion of reed and heather, a moorland rising to the border between glens, broken only by the stark red stain of a door. Nearing this otherworldly aberration, this scarlet phantasm, you realise that there is a house constructed around it, a sloping excrescence of withered planks and flaking plaster. What fell secrets could it harbour? Let us go and make our visit.

The last twelve months were bookended with the launch of two excellent VR headsets (although only one is truly relevant to us PC gamers) and a whole bunch of great VR titles. The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year. So it's an unevenly weighted set of barbells, the kind that would give our moustachioed muscleman a slipped disk.

Today you can pick up this GPU for just £266 thanks to an Amazon UK Lightning Deal on a graphics card that comes from Amazon US - with no extra import or shipping fees. That compares favourably to the £320 that the next-cheapest A770 GPU costs, especially when you consider this is the better 16GB variant with a factory overclock!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Assassin’s Creed series debuted in 2007, and since then, the series has become a fixture in the gaming landscape. It received reliable annual installments (or more!) for several years; that cadence has relented a bit now, but the franchise's long history has certainly left us with no shortage of Assassin’s Creed games to enjoy. But how do they stack up against each other?
 We originally published a version of this list back in 2015, but more Assassin's Creed games have released now, and some of our perspectives have shifted. So we are taking another look at the titles in the whole main series (no spin-offs or side-stories) and ranking them, highlighting the best moments and acknowledging the weaknesses in each.

That's was a big part of the appeal of To The Core, an incremental game with the spectacle of Vampire Survivors. I think it's now the reason I want to play the oddly named (the) Gnorp Apologue. It's an incremental town builder about... gnorps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently returned to Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, one year after the grimdark Left 4 Dead 'em up launched and eleven months after I stopped playing. It was always fun to tear through the grubby guts of a Gothic industrial megacity with your chainsword, but it became repetitive and its whole loot-o-crafting mess sucked. A year on, the loot and crafting still suck, but I've really enjoyed the variety added by new levels and weapons and the polish from a year of tweaks and quality-of-life changes. If you played Darktide on Game Pass (or bought it), consider another look.

Games where any soldier can receive a horror mark, which attracts unspeakable phantoms from beyond reality to randomly attack them, and if they survive, they'll probably receive more horror marks. Games where I once deployed my entire military against an evil raven so large and powerful that I lost, leaving behind corpses that it fed on to grow even stronger. Games where a frog could, mathematically, kill god with one blow.
Dominions 6 is due out in January, bringing with it changes so esoteric that I'd be better off talking about Dominions 3 to Dominions 5 instead. So let's do that.

It appears Nate is quite unfamiliar with time travel films. We also think up some some resolutions for next year, and you've also got our regular recommendations to look forwards to at the end of the show. Plus, Nate does a thrilling end of year quiz with a question for each month. It goes about as well as you'd expect.

If Epic Games and my Switch were involved, Fortnite and Persona 5 Royal would've absolutely been included in the lineup, too.

But I think 2024 could be a big one for me. Not only are a number of upcoming RPGs right up my alley, they align with new and existing motivations: hangs with pals and Japanese language learning. For the first time, I'm excited to embrace the grind both in-game and outside of it.

So here's a quick update for one of the more ambitious sub-projects that has been percolating along in the background: Macromedia Director support!

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20231206/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.
Earlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.
Unfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.
Since we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.
We still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.
Thank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!
