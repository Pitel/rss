Nintendo Directs are always chock-full of information on games coming to different regions. And while the North American Nintendo Direct had a bunch of games to show off, today's Nintendo Direct for Japan also had some surprising, intriguing games on display.
I try to make a habit of watching the Japanese Nintendo Direct after the North American one airs. For one, it's an interesting way to see how Nintendo organizes these shows for different regions; some games move further up in the rundown, or feel like they get a little more time. And in other cases, some games only show up in certain regions' Directs. It's a handy way to spot games you might have otherwise missed, and has put me onto early stand-outs like Gnosia's Switch port.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has done a great job making some truly inventive special edition Xbox Series controllers, and their latest effort is one that uses the 'NASA-punk' aesthetics of upcoming big budget Bethesda RPG Starfield. The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That's still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

I can’t really imagine a future where I can afford to buy a home for myself, let alone one where I could make a living buying up repair jobs and selling them at a higher price. Not that I think I’d want to. But regardless, House Flipper is probably as close as I’m going to get.
Released in 2018, House Flipper had a profound effect on the simulator genre. Not that I think it meant to. However, it hit upon a nice balance of ugly jank and tactile gameplay. It wasn’t the first of its kind, but a combination of its engaging execution of its core concept and ability to connect with audiences made it a success that others hurried to emulate. We still live in a market glutted with job simulators, and while some of them are good in their own right, it’s hard for any of them …]]></summary>

As many of you may already know, Final Fantasy XVI will feature exactly zero minigames. That's a fairly disappointing aspect of a game that's not even out yet, so we believe an eulogy is due, right now.
Much like the plots from the various games in the Final Fantasy series, most of the franchise's awesome minigames also do not carry over from game to game. It's time we take a look at the most memorable ones and perhaps hope Square Enix ports them all to Final Fantasy XIV.
10. Fort Condor (FFVII Remake)
Fans can complain all they want about the story changes that Remake brought to the original story, but it's hard to argue that they did a bad job with Fort Condor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have Castlevania at home.
If nothing else, you’ve got to give the Skautfold franchise credit for being unafraid to mix things up. After Skautfold: Shrouded in Sanity introduced the series as a retro-style survival horror, its sequels went on to span the Metroidvania, shooter, and RPG genres. Skautfold: Usurper, the latest release in the series to come to Switch, was the first Metroidvania and boasts key art that's very reminiscent of Aria of Sorrow. Unfortunately, the game isn’t very good. There are some redeeming elements here, but this isn't something that we can enthusiastically recommend.
The plot takes place in an alternate 19th-century London, picking up shortly after an alien structure called the Citadel crashed down into the city and began releasing a nefarious ‘Fog’ that drove people insane and turned them into Lovecraftian monsters. You play as Saragat, a dead knight brought back to life by a necromancer named Waltham, who has taken control of Saragat’s body to destroy the keeper of the Citadel and seize its power for himself. Yet, despite the cool premise, the story feels quite poorly written. Dialogue is overall stiff and oddly paced, and it’s difficult to follow the relationships between characters and the vague histories they each present.

Sonic the Hedgehog's official Twitter page has just announced that Sonic's YouTube and Twitch channels will host a new Sonic Central on June 23. The live showcase is akin to something like a Nintendo Direct, and will tease some of Sonic's "upcoming projects, partnerships, and events" that will take place this year.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1671548671962521600?s=20
While still don't know any details about a possible new main entry in the Sonic series, we know about some of the treats Sega has in store for fans. Nintendo has just announced that Sonic will return in Sonic Superstars this Fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0il5KpfzvCU
Superstars is an entirely new game made in the vein of the classic 2D Sonic games. It'll feature modern graphics and we don't just get to play as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. We'll get to play them all at the same time in local four-player co-op mode.
If you think Fall is too far away, then fret not. Sonic will also return in Sonic Origins Plus this very Friday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoyoWlOJILc
Origins Plus is a collection that features four classic Sonic games in HD, as well as 12 Sonic games from the Game Gear. It also boasts some new features like new challenges, modes, a playable Amy, and even her super form.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1671213321880748032?s=20
But as with all things Sonic, the backlash is never too far away. Twitter users are already claiming that the game has been leaked, and fans aren't happy with the quality of the sound of the Game Gear remasters. Twitter user Kirisame states that he has analyzed the audio files and complains that the stereo changes actually make the game sound worse.
https://twitter.com/kirisamemofo/status/1670235195050536961?s=20
To learn more about it all and more, stay tuned to Sonic's Twitch or Youtube channels this Friday, June 23, at 8 am PST or 11 am EST.

Bad news for Halo lore fans, as developer 343 Industries has confirmed that it will no longer be producing narrative cutscenes for Halo Infinite — The cinematics, which generally drop with each and every new season, will no longer be a part of the updates from Season 4 onwards.
Speaking on Twitter, 343 community director Brian Jarrard explains the decision.
"As we've refined our top priorities and shifted resources internally this year, we had to make the decision to forego seasonal narrative cutscenes to make room for the team to continue focusing on highly requested features, content, and improvements for Halo Infinite," writes Jarrard. 
https://twitter.com/ske7ch/status/1670926893078691841?s=20
"These trade-offs are never easy to make, and we truly appreciate your support as the team works to make Halo Infinite the best experience possible. While the job is far from over, Season 4 marks another big step forward and we remain committed to this journey with the Halo community."
Of course, 343 Industries was one of the Microsoft subsidiaries that was hit by layoffs at the start of the year, which forces the dedicated Halo team to prioritize its manpower and talent on the core elements of the sci-fi shooter. The studio has recently spoken of its aim to improve many areas of Halo Infinite's gameplay, with incoming additions such as a new career ranking system and the return of Infection Mode, both of which launched this week as part of Season 4's content.
Halo Infinite is available now on Xbox and PC platforms.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it's worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parental Advisory Explicit Content
Twitch is adopting a new range of labels and tags with which it hopes creators can better classify mature content on their respective channels — The new tags, which are live on the platform right now, are the latest step in the company's efforts to improve community safety on the popular streaming service.
Initially, the site had a catch-all "Mature Content" label, but the new tags hope to be a little more specific as to what audience members can expect when visiting one of the site's millions of channels.
The new labels are:
Mature-Rated Games
Sexual Themes
Drugs, Intoxication, or Excessive Tobacco Use
Violent and Graphic Depictions
Significant Profanity or Vulgarity
Gambling
While the Mature labels warn Twitch viewers of a channel's content, they are not a replacement nor a "Get Out of Jail Free Card" for anyone breaking the site's Community Guidelines, which remain unaltered at the time of writing. Streamers may receive warnings for failing to accurately label their content, with potential blocks for repeat offenders. That said, Twitch also notes that a streamer will not be auto-suspended for mislabelling their channel. You can check out the full details on the new labeling system on Twitch.
Twitch continues to implement and experiment with rules, guidelines, and features in order to combat explicit content on the website. Of course, given the mammoth nature of the streaming platform, moderation has been a momentous issue for the Twitch team, which has led to false positives, user confusion, and the controversial application, (and sometimes retraction) of security and marketing measures.

Square Enix let the Bunny out of the bag a little earlier than planned, but today's Nintendo Direct confirmed that RPG fans should be excited. Star Ocean The Second Story R is a gorgeous HD-2D-esque (but not quite) remake of the classic 1998 PS1 action RPG from tri-Ace. And it's launching on Switch on 2nd November.
With enhanced pixel art visuals and stunning 3D environments to create a unique world, Star Ocean The Second Story R allows you to play through the game as one of two characters — Claude C. Kenny and Rena Lanford. Each character has a slightly different perspective on the story, and you'll be able to recruit different characters depending on who you pick.

Today's Nintendo Direct was a bit of a Mario blowout, wasn't it? Mario and Princess Peach both got a chunk of the spotlight, and we have a classic SNES RPG remaster coming, too! However, Luigi definitely wasn't left out of the show, as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is getting a remaster on Switch next year.
Originally released in 2013 (yes, it really is ten years ago) on the 3DS, the Switch version gives the spooky sequel a lovely makeover with enhanced visuals. We only got a 20-second clip of the upcoming remaster, but it'll be filling out the beginning of 2024 nicely alongside Princess Peach's own game.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.
Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.


Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.]]></summary>

Today was a new Nintendo Direct, with a whole host of news for Switch owners on what's coming for the rest of the year on Nintendo's handheld hybrid.
It was, honestly, a pretty up-and-down Direct. I don't think there was a lack of big reveals; we got a new 2D Mario, an absolutely gorgeous remake of a classic Mario RPG, and the first two Pikmin games are hitting the Switch later today.
Still, for those with high hopes—especially given that this Direct is happening within the Not-E3 window—or those who don't care too much about Mario, I could see this falling a bit flat for them. Me? I'm personally into a lot of the third-party reveals we saw, like XSEED's new action-RPG dungeon-crawler and more Persona 5 Tactica footage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Second Story is getting an HD-2D overhaul that slaps the letter R at the end of the title, a nod to the fact that it’s a remake.
The game first launched for PlayStation in 1998 (1999 in the U.S.) and stars protagonists Claude, a human federation officer, and Rena, a mystically powered girl, who players choose to control in separate campaigns. The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. 


This enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.
Star Ocean The Second Story R launches November 2 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sucking time away.
poncle's BAFTA-winning roguelike Vampire Survivors has been a huge hit on PC, Xbox, and mobile. Dropping in Early Access first before getting a full release in October 2022, today's Nintendo Direct finally confirmed that the game will be coming to Switch — on 17th August.
The game will be $4,99 / €4,99 / £3,99 on the Switch eShop, while both DLCs — Legacy of the Moonspell and Tides of the Foscari — will be available to buy separately for $1,99 / €1,99 / £1,59 each. You're getting an endless, addictive adventure with retro pixel graphics and homages to Castlevania in spades for not even a tenner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.
While the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises "valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider." 
The Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.

This trilogy also includes all post-launch content, including DLC expansions, suits, Batmobiles, and more.

Check out Batman: Arkham Trilogy in the reveal trailer below: 


Unfortunately, this trilogy does not include the (pretty great) Batman: Arkham Origins, which wasn't developed by Rocksteady; it was developed by Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal.

As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo spoke to me directly as they announced WarioWare: Move It!. They know my weakness. They will be targeting it on November 3, 2023 on Switch.
As the name implies, you’re going to have to get off the couch. Personally, this is not something I would be excited for, but WarioWare certainly has a way of making me willing to embarrass myself.
https://youtu.be/z4kkqicAeG0
It honestly looks great. The trailer shows off the poses you’re supposed to take. True to the series, they’ve been very careful to make you look ridiculous. There’s a person doing a mad squat and another just wiggling. You can also see a whole bunch of cameos from Mario titles and Pikmin. There also appears to be some modernized versions of older Microgames.
There’s also going to be local co-op, and there will also be 4-player modes. For 4-players, there's a board game style party mode. I really hope they call the mode "Super Wario Party." I can't be the only one who thought of that.
I am definitely on board with this. I actually skipped the WarioWare: Get it Together due to a lack of funds, but I really need to get around to it. I need to "get it together," if you will.
I suppose I have time, as WarioWare: Move It! will be releasing on Nintendo Switch on November 3, 2023.

Announced during today's Nintendo Direct, Princess Peach's new game doesn't have a name just yet, and we have very few details on it at the time of its reveal. However, it looks to be a 2D side-scrolling platformer where Peach gets her powers by changing her outfits — as seen towards the end of the trailer.

To cap off its Nintendo Direct presentation, the legendary publisher lifted the lid on Super Mario Bros. Wonder, a brand new 2D platform adventure starring the iconic plumber and his friends. The new title will launch on Nintendo Switch on October 20, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JStAYvbeSHc
The trailer featured what, at first, appeared to be some classic 2D Super Mario action, but soon gave way to an elastic and playable world, featuring growing pipes, talking flowers, lanky Goombas, a night-time mode, and various other strange phenomena. The trailer also showcased the "Wonder Flowers" — powerups that can change our hero in all manner of ways, from making him taller, to increasing his jump height, and even turning him into an elephant!
Other characters are playable, including Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, and Toad, and while the gameplay seems authentic to the 2D Super Mario style, Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks to play with the world and its characters in ways never before experienced, all daubed in a vibrant, "cartoon" visual style. More information will be revealed by Nintendo in the lead-up to the game's launch on October 20.

Today's Nintendo Direct is full of surprises. In addition to some excellent RPG news, we've got some info about interesting original titles as well. A prime example of this is Penny's Big Breakaway, a new 3D platformer from the team behind Sonic Mania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAgpRYM2M8
While the game itself doesn't have too many similarities to the typical Blue Blur video game, it does promise a speedrun-centric slant with its Time Attack mode. More importantly, we got lots of yo-yo based attacks, which the titular Penny can modify with various snack-based power-ups. We can already find mentions of unlockable bonus items and secret stages, so it looks like this one will lean heavy on replay value.
Fortunately, this title won't be a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Penny's Big Breakaway will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in Early 2024.

For a minute there, I held my breath!
During today's June 21 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo talked about how successful Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been globally, and I thought for a moment: "Are we getting a Tears of the Kingdom DLC tease?" Nope! Just more amiibo. I'm sure all of you are thrilled.
Nintendo confirmed both Zelda and Ganondorf amiibo figures, which were heavily rumored thanks to some recent datamining efforts. No footage was shown off in terms of what they actually bring to the table digitally, but we did get a good look at the figures themselves, and they are fantastic.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="387849,387850"]
This dual reveal comes directly after the recent news of Zelda amiibo restocks
Nintendo seems committed to getting a ton of Zelda amiibo back into circulation, as they confirmed prior to the Nintendo Direct that there was going to be a wide restock of old figures. This led to all sorts of speculation that they'd reveal more Tears of the Kingdom amiibo, which turned out to be accurate.
We still have the Sages/new Champions too! Maybe we'll get a reveal down the line after the inevitable DLC announcement.

As part of the latest Nintendo Direct, more details were given on the upcoming Pikmin 4. On top of that, they’ve also revealed HD versions of Pikmin 1 and 2. While the HD versions are cool on their own, they’ve actually shown off a lot of previously unknown information, so let’s take a look.
The Pikmin 1 and 2 HD versions will be available today. They only showed off the title screens of each, so it’s hard to tell if they’re just HD upscales or if they got the Metroid Prime Remastered treatment. I guess we won’t have to wait long to see.
Nintendo also showed off a number of new details for Pikmin 4. Dandori Battles pit you against another spaceman to collect the most trash. You can also finally explore planet PNF-404 at night, which is a first. You’ll find the new Glow Pikmin at night.

Oh, man. There’s an area that’s inside a house. Wait, I thought that the series took place in a post-apocalypse. That kitchen looks like it’s still in use. So, are we just robbing people?
Pikmin 4 is launching on Switch on July 21st, 2023. You can try out a demo for it today. You can also purchase Pikmin 1 and/or 2 on Switch sometime today.

For Nintendo Directs, it's always good to expect the unexpected. I don't think I really expected Headbangers Rhythm Royale, though.
Shown during today's Direct, Headbangers was actually revealed earlier this month at the Future Games Showcase. Though I missed it at the time, amid all the sound and fury of Summer Game Fest, I very much noticed this bird-based battle royale during today's Direct.

Headbangers Rhythm Royale seems to pit a bunch of pigeons against each other in a musical battle royale. It looks absolutely wild. And it joins an increasingly stacked October lineup, hitting on October 31, 2023.

Developed by Luca Galante, the award-winning title sees players taking on seemingly insurmountable hordes of the undead as one of a number of characters, attempting to survive as long as possible in heart-pounding, auto-firing action. The compelling nature of the constant combat, as well as the cool aesthetic, saw Vampire Survivors win over a coffin-full of fans throughout 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has announced WarioWare: Move It, a new game in the long-running microgame series. 
The company revealed this during today's Nintendo Direct, highlighting the unique ways players can use two Joy-Con (and body movement) to complete microgames. One example shows a player using Joy-Con to balance Mario sliding in Super Mario 64. There's also plenty of first-person Wario action as well, with one microgame showing Wario trying to break out of what appears to be a jail cell. 


As you'd expect, WarioWare: Move It features a very unique, albeit strange, art style. Plus, it features two-player local co-op and a special Party Mode that allows up to four players to play various microgames together.

[Update: And it's been confirmed thanks to a Nintendo Direct! It'll be out on November 2, 2023]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JaYQDytelE&list=PL2JiZAV5BmDXxkBJQgitX9FtwE7tEd3GT&index=23
A mysterious new logo is being shared online this morning, purportedly an as-yet-unannounced new project in the popular fantasy franchise, Star Ocean. As reported by RPGSite, a banner for a "Star Ocean The Second Story R" was first discovered on the support site of IP owner Square Enix.
Originally released for PlayStation in 1998, Star Ocean: The Second Story is, as the name suggests, the second entry in the action-RPG series, which won over fans with its sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, myriad paths and conclusions, and very heavy emphasis on dating mechanics between multiple characters, allowing players to essentially dictate both narrative and gameplay through the pairing (or not) of relationships.
The "R" in the new banner suggests that this popular release may be in line for the remake/remaster treatment, though obviously, Square Enix is yet to speak on the discovery. Back in 2019, the publisher released the similarly titled Star Ocean First Departure R on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, which was itself a remaster of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the first game in the series. Thus, a continuation along these lines is very likely, and very good news for Star Ocean fans.
Of course, we will be sure to keep you updated should Square Enix be forthcoming with any news.

As a longtime RPG fan, I am losing my mind for today's Nintendo Direct. First we get the wild announcement of a Super Mario RPG remake, and now we have solid footage of the previously teased Dragon Quest Monsters followup. Even better, we know this one is arriving this year!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLsr5N4-mmU
In a blog post by Square Enix, it looks like The Dark Prince will stay true to the formula of previous games in the series. Protagonist Psaro will have to collect monsters to fight on his behalf, which he can fuse into stronger creatures using the Synthesis feature. Monsters will also include Dragon Quest series favorites alongside completely new creatures for this entry.
Additionally, the world will change with the passing of the seasons. While we don't know how expansive this will be in the final game, we have confirmation that certain areas of the world will open depending on the season.
Dragon Quest Monsters is a fantastic spinoff series for a fantastic series, so any new entry is hella welcome in my book. Additionally, it looks like previous Dragon Quest heroes may make a cameo appearance here as well. While last year's Dragon Quest Treasures was nice, I'm excited to see Monsters returning to its roots like this.
We'll learn more when Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince arrives on December 1, exclusively for Nintendo Switch

Fans of dungeon-crawling and base-building seem to have something to look forward to. Silent Hope is an action-RPG with roguish ideas and at-home base progression, and it arrives on October 3, 2023.
Revealed at today's Nintendo Direct, Silent Hope stars seven champions trying to save a princess from a prison of her own tears. (That's a big mood.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDmS6Nk0P50
The goal is to plumb the depths of the abyss, recovering resources and bringing them back to the surface. Then, back up top, you can do a bunch of base-building and home upkeep. This looks to include forging, farming, animal caretaking, and more.
It seems vaguely Rune Factory-ish, with a roguelite twist, and that's a good pitch in my opinion. We'll see how the whole venture comes together later this year, when Silent Hope hits on October 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pikmin 4 is right around the corner, but that didn't stop Nintendo from flooding us with new information about the game during today's Nintendo Direct. From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.


The main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.
You'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.
Finally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.
If you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.]]></summary>

The trilogy, which consists of Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman: Arkham City, and Batman: Arkham Knight, represents three of the greatest video games starring Gotham's protector, The Dark Knight. Featuring gothic overworlds, brilliant character designs, and hugely dramatic storylines, the Batman: Arkham Trilogy is more than deserving of its overwhelming praise, and is as playable and engaging today at it was on release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Persona 5 Tactica was announced recently through the Xbox Games Showcase, but details on gameplay were limited. Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.
In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.
Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.
Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.
Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Princess Peach will star as the main character in a new game coming to Switch next year. 
Nintendo announced this during today's Nintendo Direct, stopping short of really any details beyond that. The company didn't reveal a name or any details about gameplay, but it did actually show gameplay and it looks exactly how you'd expect. We control Peach in a 3D world that looks reminiscent of something we'd see in a Super Mario RPG.
One interesting thing the Direct did reveal was that when Peach steps on a special pedestal, her outfit changes, going from her usual pink dress to a bright, light blue dress that seems to indicate she's powered up in some way. But the reveal ends there, with Nintendo promising more information at a later date. The last game to star Peach as the main character was 2005's Super Princess Peach for DS.]]></summary>

It was a rumor that I was certain couldn't possibly be true. In fact, even as I write this, I still can't fully believe it. But Super Mario RPG is indeed getting a full fledged remake, cementing 2023 as one of the most wild years in recent gaming history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r5PJx7rlds
The footage we saw during the June 21 Nintendo Direct showed us many familiar locations faithfully recreated in 3D. While the graphical revamp takes center stage, the gameplay does appear to have some extra flourishes. For example, battles show chain bonuses and a mysterious percentage meter on the left side of the screen. What do they mean? I don't know! And I'm dying to find out!
While potential new details about this upcoming remake remain scarce, just seeing Geno and Mallow in full 3D is enough for my hype. Super Mario RPG is one of the best SNES games of all time, and now is a great time for both old and new fans to experience this classic once again.
The Super Mario RPG remake will land this year on November 17 for the Nintendo Switch. Preorders are available now.

The new Super Mario RPG trailer shows a variety of cutscenes and gameplay, including looks at turn-based combat and traversing the world. Take a look below:


The original Super Mario RPG was released for the Super Nintendo in 1996. Even as various other RPGs starring Mario have come out in the time since, many have clamored for a return to the Super Mario RPG series. While not an all-new game, a remake shows signs of life and will hopefully satisfy those fans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming in 2024
Previously released in 2013 exclusively on 3DS, Nintendo announced today during their June 21 Direct that Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is coming to Switch. "It's launching next year, it's a port of the 3DS game, and it's visually enhanced" is pretty much all we got! It was a hurried announcement directly after the reveal that Princess Peach was getting her own game, and both are due out in 2024.
Here's all Nintendo had to say about it after the stream:
"A visually enhanced version of Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon, originally released on Nintendo 3DS, is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. Can Luigi summon the courage to save Evershade Valley? Explore haunted mansions full of spooky specters and bone-chilling challenges next year. More information will be available in the future."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7t5jnpkCkI
Classic "more info in the future!" For reference, the announcement starts at 42:30, and Nintendo declined to provide a separate trailer for Dark Moon Switch.
Although the 3DS had a pretty firm install base in 2013, getting this series out to a new audience is a great thing. Luigi's Mansion is kind of an unsung franchise for Nintendo, and it does well enough to continue on: I'll take anything I can get! That includes a new iteration of the Luigi's Mansion arcade game, which I pretty much have memorized at this point.

During this morning's Nintendo Direct presentation, the studio revealed the details of the next Splatoon 3 splatfest, which will be taking place in the popular and super messy team shooter in mid-July.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98TZHMaP6yA
The new splatfest, which is perfect for the summer season, focuses on delicious ice cream, and asks players which is their favorite flavor chosen from the trinity of Vanilla, Strawberry, and Mint Choc Chip. There's no sign of Neopolitan, so you can't cheat, and Rum 'n' Raisin isn't on deck, so I guess I'm out. In this case, I'll go with MCC, but that will also side me with Big Man, and that dude bothers me.
Anyway, the ice-cream splatfest will take place on the weekend of July 14, so be sure to jump into the arena and win the side for your favorite ice-cold treat... Well, at least from these three particular choices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk
Nintendo kicked off their Nintendo Direct today with their cash cow: Pokemon. Specifically, we got a closer look at the setting for both DLC adventures coming to Pokemon Scarlet & Violet later this year.
The Teal Mask will have a feudal Japan theme, as we've seen a good deal of leading into this particular Direct. The Indigo Disk will partially take place at the "Blueberry Academy," which is much more futuristic in nature than the Teal Mask setting. "More details are coming in the future," so this is basically a drip feed of footage for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0UUtohagU4
As a reminder, Teal Mask is still slated for fall 2023, and Indigo Disk is coming in winter.
Here's the latest info from Nintendo, which is still fairly vague beyond the visuals in the trailer and the reconfirmation of certain returning Pokemon:
"More Pokemon, places and stories await in this two-part DLC for the Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet games. In this story, you’ll be leaving the Paldea region and delving even deeper into the world of the Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet games. Part 1: The Teal Mask has a planned release date of fall 2023 and Part 2: The Indigo Disk has a planned release date of winter 2023. The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC is available for pre-purchase now in Nintendo eShop and in the My Nintendo Store on Nintendo.com."

More events are coming to Pokemon Scarlet & Violet this week
[caption id="attachment_387763" align="alignnone" width="640"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
While the DLC is on the horizon, there is something you can do right now. Well, later today, at least!
There's a special Tera Raid event for Chest Form Gimmighoul running from June 21 through July 2, and you can use the password "TREASUREHUNT" for goodies (Nugget x10, Rare Candy x10, Friend Ball x1).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last February, Game Freak revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had DLC in the works, but all we got to show for it was a few pieces of concept art and static images of new Pokémon. Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.


Titled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.
The first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.
While the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.
No specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.]]></summary>

There’s been quite a bit of talk around the release of Final Fantasy XVI, mostly about what a Final Fantasy game is. Depending on the era you started playing games and the consoles you played them on, that answer can vary wildly. And with Final Fantasy XVI breaking new ground for the series, this debate has carried on for a while.
After rolling credits on Final Fantasy XVI, I can verify it is a Final Fantasy game. It’s about crystals and magic, ancient beings of incredible power, and swords clashing over ideals that could shape the fate of the world. Plus, there’s chocobos and moogles. If nothing else, those are absolute signifiers.
Credentials aside, Final Fantasy XVI feels like a big step in a new direction. It might not be the classic style some long-time fans had hoped …]]></summary>

Final Fantasy XVI is bombastic, indulgent, and extreme, breaking far beyond the limits of what I thought an action-oriented Final Fantasy could pull off. It represents a pivotal shift for the series, ditching any semblance of turn-based move selection, active-time battles, or anything else in its history in favor of a fast-paced, extravagant, combo-heavy combat system that continued to grow more robust throughout my 60-plus hour journey. 
There’s a linear action game in FFXVI, and it’s the highlight of the experience. But standard RPG tropes, mechanics, …]]></summary>

Nintendo is, once again, preparing to take to the airwaves with another exciting Nintendo Direct live stream presentation. The Big N's summer showcase will be kicking off at the top of the next hour, offering updates, news, and perhaps a reveal or two for the publisher's 2023 catalog. And beyond?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7t5jnpkCkI
We can expect 40 minutes of news, with the Nintendo Direct modus operandi generally consisting of a few in-depth looks peppered by string after string of stressful-to-cover headlines. While the itinerary remains a mystery, we can definitely expect some time to be dedicated to pint-sized adventure Pikmin 4, which will launch on Nintendo Switch exactly one month from today. As for what else will be featured in the stream, well, we'll just have to wait an hour and find out.
Of course, Team Destructoid will be on hand to cover all of the big stories, but we'd also love to hear your running commentary in the comments below. The Nintendo Direct kicks off at 07:00 PT / 10:00 ET / 15:00 BST, and here's to hoping that it brings you at least one particularly exciting piece of news. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roblox is launching new regulation in order to allow creators to make content specifically for users aged 17 and above. From what Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's Chief Product Officer, shared in an official blog post yesterday, it seems that it'll be on creators to label their experiences as mature, which "may contain more violence, blood, or crude humour" than usual experiences.
The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to "simulate and even go beyond what's possible in the real world". Bronstein also added that, "We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox," referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stop me if you've heard this one before: the RTX 4060 Ti just came out but you should probably buy the RTX 3060 Ti instead. It's around 85 to 90 percent of the performance at less than 70 percent of the cost - although you do give up better power efficiency and DLSS 3 on the newer model. 
We've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news, everyone! AMD's fastest graphics card is now available for less money, in what deals scientists are calling a "sale" or "limited time promotion". According to the latest research, this phenomena can be observed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically the UK and the US, with discounts applied on both sides. This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £900 to £750 in the US (no ticking required).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.
You can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.
As you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.
The recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.
For more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here. For some of our positive hands-on impressions of the game, head here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By most measures, From Software's success is a surprise. Not because it makes bad games; time has proven it makes some of the greatest games of all time. But because it makes incredibly difficult, obtuse games, such as the Soulsborne titles, defined by their challenge and willingness to go against common game design philosophies. From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.
Early in June, we flew out to Tokyo, Japan, to visit From Software to be the first people in the world to see Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. While the AC series has been with From for its entire history as a game developer, …]]></summary>

This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

Initially revealed on stage during Sony's 2014 E3 press conference, Dead Island 2 had an infamously rocky road to release. What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development. Until it resurfaced in late 2022, a seeming sign that Dead Island 2 would see the light of day – which i…]]></summary>

El Paso, Elsewhere is no different, and you can even try it out now as part of this season's Steam Next Fest in a new demo. And yeah, the vibes are about as tight as you'd expect.

June 20, 2023
While Nintendo's presence was typically a given back when E3 was still around, its relative silence over the last month left many to doubt whether or not there would be a summer showcase at all. The company's Twitter account has also been the source of a scattered handful of announcements lately, posting everything from new Joy-Con colors to a sequel to 1-2 Switch to a new trailer for Pikmin 4. Still, Nintendo has plenty to announce, whether it's something we expect (like Metroid Prime 4) or something entirely new.
We'll find out for ourselves at the livestream tomorrow.
What do you think Nintendo will announce tomorrow? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really like escape rooms IRL, and have a tremendous amount of respect for the people who devise them. But seeing as how they last about an hour and cost approximately the same as it would for Wales to secede from the United Kingdom, I can only afford to pay an immersive experience what it deserves every so often (the rest of the time I'm honourbound by my fatherland to donate to causes supported by Michael Sheen). I'm therefore pleased that there seems to be an uptick in escape room video games. Plese do more of those, developers.

I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's "filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to "really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

We haven't have access to every demo in this year's Next Fest, I should note, but think of these more as some initial tasting suggestions to get you started, rather than a complete overview of what's worth playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One mistake I often see novice PC builders making is overspending on the motherboard. It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/06/19/hideo-kojima-wont-direct-the-death-stranding-movie-but-he-is-deeply-involved"/>
        <updated>2023-06-19T15:54:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.
Just to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.
June 18, 2023
Here, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be "deeply involved" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will "introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe," according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.
In addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:
Given the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.]]></summary>

Every sprite oozes a frantic combination of energy and personality, from the steel-eyed sprint of your starting gun-bird-thing to the bobbing scuttle of the cyclops clayfish boss. Guns have punch, stomps have oomph, reward boxes have merry jingles. It's a top-down roguelike shooter that does everything right, and seldom have I seen a game more deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. 
It left early access 11 days ago, which is 11 days you could have spent splatting crustaceans and wasps with skeleton trombones and deadly finger guns.

It's been nearly 11 years since Edmund Mcmillen, known for Super Meat Boy and Binding Of Isaac, first announced that the mysterious cat breed 'em up would be Team Meat's next game. The cats wound up waiting outside while they worked on other things, but we now have a much more concrete idea of what the game is.
The developers have actually been posting extensive development updates since January, but McMillen also just recorded an adhoc TikTok video where he points his phone at his screen. Turns out Mewgenics is a turn-based strategy roguelike with wizard cats who can cut their paws while opening windows. Could be worth the wait!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

For a certain sort of Elder Scrolls player, it’s the only way to travel through a fantasy open world - perma-crouched, bow stretched lazily across the lower third of the screen. And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.
“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one. I’m pretty sure what goes into these.”

Based on a French novel by Boris Vian, this tells a strange and surprisingly dark story about a famously handsome young himbo who gets caught up in a sinister plot in 1950s Los Angeles and has to adventure, talk, fight, and - horrors - reason his way to the truth. It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious players can get their hands on Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders for the first time via a closed alpha later this month. 
On June 29, the PvPvE extraction shooter will get its first test out in the wild, so to speak. You’ll have to sign up on Steam to participate in the alpha, and a new trailer provides some fresh (pre-alpha) gameplay clips. 


ARC Raiders made its big debut at The Game Awards in 2021 and was originally pitched as a co-op PvE experience about players working together to battle invading alien machines. It had been slated to launch last year before Embark delayed the game in order to focus on finishing up its other upcoming free-to-play team shooter, The Finals (which has a second playable beta running now until June 21). Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. 
Embark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Did 2020's summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It's probably a horror game set in space. Doesn't that look great? Now let's take a look at the first game by a new studio comprised of ex-Bioware devs.


Yep, that's right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I've commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.
The tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has announced Absurd Ventures, his new studio. 
Houser was Rockstar's vice president when he announced in 2020 that he was leaving the company behind franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. At the time of the announcement, Houser revealed that he had taken an extended break starting in the spring of 2019. His last day at Rockstar, which he co-founded with his brother Sam Houser in 1998, was March 11. 
Now, three years later, Houser has revealed Absurd Ventures. This studio is focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts."


It sounds quite ambitious and while Absurd Venture's official website features all kinds of visuals showcasing its style, there's nothing official in terms of projects announced at this time.

Unlike Carn's Barbarian, Quin69's Druid wasn't level 100 yet, but he was pretty darn close at level 91. His Druid had 172 hours and 50 minutes of play time. That's more than a week's worth of playing and the game's only been out for 10 days (or 15, if we're including early access).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next game coming to Nintendo Switch Online is Fire Emblem. 
More specifically, Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance version of Fire Emblem, otherwise known as Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, is coming to its subscription service for all Expansion Pack subscribers next week on June 23. This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. 


A prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. 
Fire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week. While waiting for Fire Emblem to hit the library on June 23, read Game Informer's review of Fire Emblem Engage. 
Are you going to check out Fire Emblem next week? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory can be a fickle thing. For thirty-something Mimi, everything before her thirteenth birthday is a blank. What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the year’s best (and most literal) surprises, Hi-Fi Rush, is getting a free update that keeps the beat going with the addition of new modes and content. 
The “Arcade Challenge! Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. 


The first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. 
This update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. 
Hi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can read our review of the game here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure that describing Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors sounds like it’s betraying a terminal lack of imagination. But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. "It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.
And yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.

Alice even made up for her recording absence by pre-emptively tying Nate to a chair and forcibly making him watch trailers, like that bit in A Clockwork Orange but with "WORLD EXCLUSIVE" flashing up every thirty seconds. Still, we keep it light by focusing on the games we actually like the look of, from The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria to Starfield, Nova Roma to Dungeons of Hinterberg.

According to a press release, the sequel is due out in early 2025, so about a year and a half away as it stands, and you'll of course be able to pick it up on Steam when it does. Come and watch its reveal trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are old games that are plain too hard to get into now, even I have to concede. Ancient ruins of a house to be admired and contemplated, but not fit to live in. The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. 
It's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.
What I'm saying is: it's still worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dambuster Studios have offered up a rough roadmap of what we can expect from the pair of upcoming Dead Island 2 story expansions. The first of the two expansions, titled Haus, asks the question, "How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?" and answers that with "a techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore!". Sounds about right. This first expansion has quite a vague release window, expected to launch some time between October and December this year.

I'm exceedingly pumped for Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown - and so is Prince Of Persia creator, Jordan Mechner. When I visited Ubisoft Montpellier at the end of May, one of things game director Mounir Radi told me about during my visit was how relieved he felt after showing Mechner a very early prototype. And in speaking to Mechner earlier this week about how he feels about The Lost Crown now, he tells me that "what I've seen so far of their modern 2D Metroidvania take on [Prince Of Persia] has got me excited and very eager to play."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much as I adored Theme Park, it's a bit of a weird game to have inspired so many descendants. The latest is Park Beyond, and for the most part it's exactly what you'd expect. Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.
That's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.

The new mode joins the game as part of its 1.4 update, and looks to be all about what it says on the tin - being creative! Essentially, the big thing it lets you do is build your own unique voxel structures by, essentially, painting them in the air. Think of it as a sort of paired back, voxel-focused approach to a piece of 3D modelling software like Blender.

So, I've gone and played another Sonic haven't I? This time I spent around 15-minutes with Sonic Superstars at this year's Summer Game Fest, a new 2.5D sidescroller that seems to successfully combine the feel of Sonic Mania with a modern art style and some new tricks. If you like old Sonic games, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love it. If you don't, there's no doubt in my mind you'll think it's agony.

Remnant: From The Ashes entered the looter-shooter space in 2019, defining its core loop with procedurally-segmented levels and Dark Souls-inspired mechanics like a stamina-based dodge roll and limited-use health consumables. Remnant’s fresh take on the shooter genre attracted praise, including Game Informer’s review which states, “Strong systems and a satisfying gameplay loop give Remnant: From The Ashes a powerful foundation, even if the experience is mired by repetitive and uninteresting bosses and environments.“

This 32-inch curved VA monitor offers a mighty 4K resolution, 165Hz refresh rate and a Mini LED backlight that provides superb, almost OLED-like HDR performance - without the burn-in potential or agressive brightness limiters that often feature on OLED panels. Now this is a premium option, with a normal price point of £999, but today with the 48HR20 code it's a slightly more palatable £799 at the Samsung UK store.

Following its DS release, the game was ported to iOS devices, but later this month, it will land on consoles for the first time. Ghost Trick will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 30 where it will receive a visual upgrade and the first opportunity to play it without a touch-screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rogue Legacy 2 is one heck of a roguelike that only Xbox, Switch, and PC fans have enjoyed since it launched in 1.0 last year. Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.
Developer Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. 


We awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, "Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact."]]></summary>

This series comes from French animation studio Bobbypills, which is also animating Netflix’s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired Captain Laserhawk. Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. 


Dead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. 
For more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its reveal during Xbox Games Showcase, Capcom have given us a few details on their upcoming game Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess. When it was first announced on Sunday, we knew very little about the game other than it looks very pretty, and we've been eager to know more ever since. The game also opened Capcom's own showcase the next day, where the same trailer was shown and we didn't get any new information on it. Very enlightening. But luckily, some more details have dripped through, which we've summarised below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LA is an amazing, if tremendously grey place. Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?
Having seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.

Even next to its wonky performance on desktops, it ran truly dreadfully on the Valve handheld, leading to the Steam custodians themselves slapping it with an Unsupported rating. Following yesterday’s v1.1.0 patch, however, it’s in much better technical shape, and has swapped that miserable grey Unsupported badge for a reassuringly green Verified one.

It’s a daft, yet competitive combo of the two in which you move chess pieces around a board (yer check mate) and then transition to a side-on fighting game where your pieces beat the shit out of each other (yer showdown) to determine who stays on the board. Does it deserve those eyeballs, then? After playing an early version of it myself, I sure think so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I visited Ubisoft Montpellier to play Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown the other week, the developers spoke extensively how about anime and comic books had been a big inspiration for them in creating the game's visuals. As you'll have seen from my big preview, the game itself is a 2.5D platformer that mixes 3D character models and environments with sidescrolling action and dramatic camera movements as hero Sargon doles out his suite of special attacks. But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games. So I put the question to art director Jean-Christophe Alessandri and game director Mounir Radi after my demo session.

Big words! Exciting words. As announced yesterday, we'll get to judge for ourselves when it comes out on October 3rd.

The update trailer also also shows off some new special attacks, starring distinguished robot CNMN and Smidge the tutorial fridge. It's out July 5th, and there's definitely enough to make me want to pop back in.

After six years of massive open-world RPGs, Ubisoft’s long-running Assassin’s Creed franchise is returning to its stealth-based, dense city roots with Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the more I see of it, the more excited I get for October. I’ve enjoyed the series’ foray into RPGs over the years, but 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which took me more than 100 hours to roll credits on, left me exhausted and burnt out with what Ubisoft had done to a franchise whose games previously took 20 hours to beat.

However, not all of the PvE content was axed. I traveled to Blizzard's headquarters in Irvine, California to be the first person outside of the company to get my hands on the upcoming Story Missions.
The Story Missions take place during the invasion of the Null Sector, the rogue Omnic group. Overwatch 2: Invasion is the name of t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.
The collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.


The Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.
Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pragmata may be the most mysterious title in Capcom's upcoming portfolio of games, and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future. A brief update during the Capcom Showcase confirmed the game's release was slipping out of 2023 and into the unknown.


The video shows the enigmatic, glowy-eyed little girl (apparently named Diana) innocently drawing as her decidedly adult astronaut(?) guardian fends off mechanized attackers before he whisks her away from danger. We then see her doodle is a cute vehicle to break the bad news, followed by a more formal message from the development team stating...
It is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release of Pragmata.
Our team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.
Thank you for your continued support.
-The Pragmata Development Team
Pragmata was first announced in 2020, and we still know next to nothing about it. So far, we've seen that some kind of catastrophe has befallen Earth, and the game unfolds in a "near-future dystopian world on the moon," according to Capcom. The game was originally slated for 2022 before getting delayed to 2023. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Since the reveal of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2021, I’ve been curious how The Division developer Ubisoft Massive will take on this property, one of the most financially successful movie franchises in the world, and translate it into a video game. Knowing Ubisoft’s pedigree, I imagined what Frontiers of Pandora might look like: something between Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry. After a special behind-closed-doors presentation during Ubisoft’s summer gaming event, I can say I was spot on. 
Most interesting to me, instead of controlling an Avatar, which is meant to resemble Pandora’s native Na’vi,…]]></summary>

The reveal shows smuggler Kay Vess sneaking and shooting her way through a galaxy far far away. There's a lot going on in this trailer, so let's break it down.
The demonstration starts with Kay trying to make her way out of a deadly situation. While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind. It's exciting to see a companion like that as more than just a cute, (hopefu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during Ubisoft's Foward event, we got a new look at gameplay from Assassin's Creed Mirage – a throwback of sorts to the long-running series' roots. 
In the footage, we see a few assassinations, a chase, and our protagonist Basim taking on missions. There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.
Check out the gameplay footage below.


Notably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.
You can also check out a new trailer for the game below.


Assassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.]]></summary>

First up is Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, which comes to Meta Quest 2 and 3 later this year. The game lets players control Ezio (AC II), Connor (AC III), and Kassandra (AC: Odyssey) in first-person through an original story that lets players parkour, hide in the shadows, and assassinate targets in the more immersive avenue that VR provides. Check out the CG trailer below. 


We next saw footage of gameplay from Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade, the free-to-play mobile title set in ancient China that was announced last September. The brief montage showed off shots of the detailed open world and the signature assassin’s gameplay. Jade is the first title that lets the player build their own protagonist from scratch, and you can register now to join the game’s first playable beta.]]></summary>

Players will explore the city of Honolulu, drive up volcanic rocks, and along beachsides. It seems clear that The Crew Motorfest has drawn at least some inspiration from the destination-focused gameplay of other racing games like Forza Horizon.
The game is also embracing the focus on car collection, including an option to import your car collection from the prior Crew game.
The Crew Motorfest is targeting a beta in July, so players should be able to get a better sense of the racing action in just a few weeks. The game is out on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:
The original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)
A ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive "Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.
Both modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.
Help us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!
