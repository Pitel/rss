Somewhere in the distant north, a scarlet priest works his elven minions into a frenzy as he prepares for the rite of the magic baby.

Most importantly, gifts of roughly equivalent financial value will be exchanged to demonstrate affection and prolong the reign of capitalism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been hands-on with Sifu, a beat ‘em up action-adventure game by Absolver developers Sloclap. My hands weren’t exactly “on”, but more “around”, actually. That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2021/12/15/new-uncharted-movie-poster-hints-at-uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-connection"/>
        <updated>2021-12-15T15:51:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony Pictures Entertainment released the first official trailer for its upcoming Uncharted movie, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, back in October and it featured plenty of iconic sequences from Naughty Dog’s action-adventure series. 
That trailer led many to speculate that while Uncharted takes place before the Naughty Dog games, opting to go with a much younger Nathan Drake, the movie would be touching on each of the games in some way. For example, we see the iconic cargo-plane-over-a-desert sequence from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception in the trailer. We also see Chloe Frazer in the trailer, a character who doesn’t appear in the games until Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and the main antagonist seems pulled right out of Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. 
If you were looking for a tie or connection to Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, the newest poster released by Fandango today has you covered. 
As you can see in the poster, it’s quite reminiscent of Uncharted 4, or rather, one of the final settings in it. Near the end of Uncharted 4, our cast is swinging from pirate ship to pirate ship in search of pirate gold and an escape from a ruined pirate city. Nathan Drake eventually makes his way to what is basically a pirate ship graveyard and it looks a lot like what’s seen in the background of this new poster. 
As for how Uncharted will tackle this connection to Uncharted 4 – which mind you, is just speculation for now, but like, come on, look at it – alongside the nods to the other Uncharted games, we’ll have to wait and see when Uncharted is released in theaters on February 18. All that’s left now is to hint at The Lost Legacy and Golden Abyss. 
While waiting for this movie to release, check out the first official trailer and then check out this look at Nolan North, the voice actor of Nathan Drake, on set with Holland.  Are you excited about Uncharted? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Super Mario Kart may have launched way back in 1993 and spawned several sequels since then, but it has lost none of its power when it comes to attracting record-breaking attempts.
We've covered the likes of Sami Cetin on Nintendo Life in the past, as well as Guillaume "Antistar" Leviach – two of the world's best Super Mario Kart speedrunners — or speed-drivers, we should probably say. Incredibly, the latter has broken not one but two world records in the space of as many weeks – one of which was previously thought to be impossible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Pokémon Legends: Arceus introduces players to the game’s two rival clans. The aptly named Diamond and Pearl factions (Arceus takes place in the Sinnoh region, after all) are factions you'll interact with in addition to the previously revealed Galaxy Expedition Team. 
Both clans share a deep respect for Pokémon though they are divided by their opposing philosophies. The Diamond clan, led by the daring Adaman and his Leafeon partner, values living in the moment with your allies. The Pearl clan cherishes the land itself, and its leader Irida, along with her Glaceon, is suspicious of newcomers. The trailer also introduces Ginkgo Guild Merchants, a traveling guild you’ll purchase goods from.

For those currently playing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Arceus has a treat for you. Players with save data from either game will be rewarded a modern Team Galatic set and a research quest that pits you against the mythical Pokémon Darkrai. 
Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches on January 28 for Switch. For more news on the game, check out the recently revealed Hisuian Voltorb and the Hisuian forms of Zorua and Zoroark.]]></summary>

Unsurprisingly, a lot of fan suggestions revolve around video games. LEGO has made Minecraft sets in the past, and more recently, that fancy tech-enabled Super Mario line, but in general, Nintendo-themed sets don't seem to make it past LEGO's tough final step: an official committee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What score would you give Nintendo's first-party output this year?
Much as it did at the start of 2020, Nintendo's first-party schedule looked extremely light in January 2021. While not knowing what's coming can be frustrating for fans looking at a blank slate, it's the natural result of a company that keeps its cards close to its chest and generally announces games only when they're mere months away rather than years (for the most part — how you doin' Metroid Prime 4!).
As we've come to expect, Nintendo had some surprises up it's sleeve and, looking back, it's turned out to be a strong year for first-party titles. Rifling through Nintendo-developed first-party releases only, we've had the likes of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, New Pokémon Snap, Famicom Detective Club, Game Builder Garage, Miitopia, Mario Golf: Super Rush, Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, WarioWare: Get It Together!, Metroid Dread, Mario Party Superstars, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain over the last 12 months.

As previously revealed, you’ll be Franklin’s partner in his new business, F. Clinton and Partner, a fixer agency designed to solve celebrity problems.

Back in the Summer, among a whole lot of online events and game reveals, Chinatown Detective Agency was a title that caught our eye. A mystery adventure inspired by the Carmen Sandiego series that also has a cyberpunk aesthetic, it's easy to be drawn in; you can get a decent look at it in the developer overview above (via GameSpot Trailers).
It's developed by General Interactive Co., and today it's been confirmed that Humble Games will be publishing the game across all platforms. It has an updated release window too, with it now planned for Spring 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight just released its original story chapter, Portrait of a Murder, two weeks ago, but it seems Behaviour Interactive is already hard at work on what’s next for the asymmetrical horror game: Ringu. 
Ringu was first released in 1998 in Japan by director Hideo Nakata before it was remade as The Ring in the West by director Gore Verbinski, who would direct a trio of Pirates of the Caribbean movies for Disney (weird directorial jump, right?). Already a famous horror icon in Japan, Verbinski’s take further solidified the story of The Ring (and Ringu) as a classic in the genre. Now we’re all scared of videotapes, wells, and scary people emerging out of television screens. Behaviour Interactive will revive those fears with its newest chapter, due out in March of 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omno? Om-yes!
Omno is an easy game. It’s unchallenging in every sense of the word. You already know the controls. You’ve seen this general graphical style before and can quickly read the environments. The gameplay loop is familiar: explore, platform, do a sliding-block puzzle, reach a new area. The story is simple and doesn’t dig very deep. There are no enemies; you have no lives and can’t die. It’s pretty to look at and gentle to listen to. It’s fairly short. It’s an easy game.
It’s easy by design, and commendably easy in practice. There are no intended hindrances, and almost no accidental hindrances like weird clipping or overlong checkpoints. The platforming sometimes loses its footing slightly – jump distances occasionally fall irritatingly between your normal range and a boost ability, and it’s not always clear if a route was intended to be climbed or you just fudged it.

Ah, Silksong — it's been so long. Devotees of Team Cherry's masterful Metroidvania Hollow Knight have been waiting quite a while for the follow up to one of indie gaming's breakout hits of 2017. First revealed in February 2019, a demo featured in Nintendo's E3 2019 Treehouse stream back in June 2019 and it was looking good at that stage... and that's pretty much all we've seen or heard of it since.
One particularly passionate fan, WeeblesJeebles on Reddit, has taken to drawing the titular character once a day, every day while waiting for the sequel to drop. Starting on December 18th 2019 — shortly after Team Cherry previewed Chris Larkin's soundtrack for the game — WeeblesJeebles is now up to Day 683... and still no Silksong.

It's creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a "mini-expansion" in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee's Mod, it's slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, which will undoubtedly get a much cooler name from Nintendo when the time is right, made a star appearance in this year's online-only E3. The trailer above made clear that it'll be an ambitious follow-up to the much-loved original, with Link seen up in the skies and doing all sorts of interesting things; great hair too, it really is a thing of beauty.
Interestingly, Gamereactor.eu has been digging around and come across patents published by Nintendo that reinforce some of the fascinating features we saw, and in one case gives us thoughts of epic sky-falling showpieces.

"Well, that looks terrible," chortled I, knowing full well that I'd still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale.

Dead by Daylight is still a rather popular multiplayer game across pretty much all platforms, as one hunter takes on a team of four survivors. The IP has been a huge success for Behaviour Interactive, and it's had all sorts of crossovers with major franchises from across games, films and TV.
It's now confirmed one of its more intriguing (and arguably lucrative) horror tie-ins, teaming up with Kadokawa Corporation to integrate Ringu (known by many as Ring) into the game. As for how it'll appear in the game, the press release states that it'll be a "new Chapter inspired by Kōji Suzuki’s novel (1991) and the original acclaimed film adaptation (1998)", with talk of "countless gameplay possibilities". Perhaps these wells will be found throughout maps and apply curses and effects, for example, it'll be interesting to see.

A Tactical Slayer (SWAT), Fiesta, and Free-For-All playlist have been added as well. For more information about these playlists, head to 343 Industries' full update breakdown.

If you don't want to actually catch 'em all, why not... clone 'em all? A new glitch has been discovered in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl that can get you an entire box of cloned Pokémon and items.
Following an earlier cloning glitch, which was patched out, a new one has been found (and will, no doubt, also be patched out in time), and at time of writing, is still possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Praey for the Gods has been in Steam Early Access since 2019, but it’s officially 1.0 as of…today! Furthermore, the game is also available on consoles. 
The game has been kicking around for some time, having first been revealed in 2015. It caught our attention thanks to its Shadow of the Colossus-inspired boss battles. Set in a frozen, open world, you play as a warrior outfitted with tools such as a glider and grapple hook used to scale titans as well as mountains and other structures. As a survival game, you’ll also have to catch food and craft items/equipment to survive the unforgiving landscape. If this is your first time hearing about the title, the launch trailer below offers a good idea of what the experience entails.

For those who have been playing the game in Early Access, the final version adds two final bosses, completes the narrative, and features a swath of quality of life updates/bug fixes.
You can play Praey for the Gods on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inscryption is one of 2021’s biggest surprises in more ways than one. Outside of being a very good game (it cracked our Top 10 Games of 2021, after all) it also has a lot more going for it than it lets on. Those who have seen the adventure to its conclusion but are itching for more creepy card game goodness should be happy to hear that a small expansion is out now.
The update is called Kaycee’s Mod and serves as an endlessly replayable version of the cabin portion of the game. Players can challenge Leshy in an increasingly difficult series of card battles, with each level unlocking new cards, challenges, and even developer logs recorded by the expansions’ namesake. If you’ve completed Inscryption, you know the significance of that last bit. 
❗️Inscryption: Kaycee's Mod❗️
https://t.co/ohMNIFpK6F pic.twitter.com/c7sfQHHNFi
December 14, 2021
To access Kaycee’s Mod, you’ll have to right-click on Inscryption in your Steam library. Select “Properties”, click the “Betas” tab, and punch in the code “givemeascensionmode”. Once you’re at the start screen, hit Shift+K+M to unlock the mod. Creator Daniel Mullens also warns that players should probably back up their save files prior to accessing Kaycee’s Mod. 
In a Steam post, Mullens explains that Kaycee’s Mod is a thank you to everyone who’s played Inscryption and that he wanted to appease fans who really enjoyed the Leshy’s Cabin chapter of the game. The expansion is billed as a beta, so expect some eventual balance changes as well as two new cards/items, more dev logs, and even a final encounter at the end of the 12th level.

As you might expect, there are a lot of references to Zelda: Breath of the Wild in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity – it's hardly a massive shock, given that both are based on the same version of the Zelda universe.
However, Twitter user Alexander Trevino has spotted one of the most subtle references yet, and it takes place during the game's final cutscene. It sees Princess Zelda cooked up a recipe, and if you look closely, it's actually one you can create in Breath of the Wild: Enduring Monster Stew.

For 22 years, FantasyAnime has been distributing the ROMs for select Square Enix games, including SaGa, the Mana series, Final Fantasy, and Chrono Trigger, but after receiving a cease and desist notice from Square Enix, they will be removed from the site.

Mario Kart 64 has a special place in many of our hearts, a game that transformed the look of the series and introduced a number of classic tracks. It has some great music too, and a project that we've enjoyed listening to throughout today has been Skario Kart: A Ska Tribute to Mario Kart 64.
It's an album you can listen to on Bandcamp (and also purchase if you want a download copy), with some fantastic arrangements from various artists that add a different spin to the game's music. And really, the name and cover art alone make it worth your time.

        <updated>2021-12-14T18:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studio’s remake of System Shock has been in the works for some time. First announced in 2016, the game was tentatively planned to launch this past summer but will now arrive sometime in 2022.
Unfortunately, Nightdive still hasn’t nailed down an exact release date. It did announce a publishing deal with Prime Matter to help bring the game to PC and unspecified consoles. Taking place on an abandoned space station, the first-person game tasks players with surviving a hostile AI named SHODAN and the dangerous enemies lurking aboard.  The original 1994 game is widely considered a classic and a pioneer for story-driven first-person action games. 
Nightdive has also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in the gallery below.

An updated playable PC demo for System Shock was released in February, which you can still download on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG. Nightdive bills it as the final demo before the game’s full release. 
The wait continues, but some update is better than nothing (unlike the long-lost System Shock 3). In case you missed it, a live-action System Shock TV show is also in the works.]]></summary>

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Stuart takes a look at the upcoming open-world Sonic game and ponders the promise it has, and pitfalls it has to negotiate...

The Game Awards were a double-header for us Sonic fans. A full trailer for the blue blur’s second movie and, more pertinently, our first real glimpse of the next major Sonic game, one Sonic Frontiers. And it’s been met with somewhat scornful comparisons to the absolutely exhausted benchmark of the “open-world” mega-genre, one The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Never mind the fact that Sonic was traversing big, open spaces back in 1991. What are “sandbox” locations if not extrapolations on the wide-linear likes of the original Green Hill Zone, eh? Riddle me that, Zelda. Maybe we could have a Sonic game where his sneakers break every fifteen seconds and you have to keep replacing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkane Studios has built a strong cult following over the last decade. Its expertise is developing immersive sims – games that facilitate unpredictable stories and emergent gameplay through player choice, complex AI, persistent systems, and sandbox level design. Like the best immersive sims, Deathloop encourages you to use its robust suite of tools to poke at its many systems and environments to differing results, which then allows you to piece together the best route through any place. However, unlike its predecessors Dishonored and Prey, Deathloop doesn’t have one specific mission, ability, or weapon that stands out as the best part of the adventure. Instead, it showcases how a game’s many elements can interact with one another to create a truly unique experience.
Specifically, the game’s level design and time of day system work together to create a setting that invites exploration and houses adaptive characters to provide consequences to player actions. Add in a consistent ruleset and shared design language that permeates every aspect of Deathloop, and you’ll understand why the title is one of the best releases of 2021.
There isn’t one particular thread greater than the rest. Deathloop is an impressive intersection of stories and gameplay systems woven together to create a tapestry deserving of your attention. In my latest video essay, I break down the game design behind Deathloop in an attempt to better understand one of the best games on PlayStation 5 and my personal favorite game of 2021:

It seems like a lot of the 'end of year' stuff is happening a little earlier, and Nintendo is pitching in by launching its rather neat 'Year in Review' website.

North American Year In Review Page
European Year In Review Page

If you go to the official page while logged into your Nintendo Account it summarises your play activity and breaks it down into all sorts of stats. You can see how many games you played, how many were 'new', and of course your most played games in terms of hours. You also get a percentage showing your docked / portable split, for example.

It Takes Two was undoubtedly the big story of The Game Awards last week, scooping up Best Family Game (which is an interesting take on that category, for sure) but more importantly the lucrative Game of the Year award. It's an extremely stylish, fun and cleverly designed game, but also has to be played in co-op or not at all.
It's a key part of the game's creative vision, and with a friend's pass system does its best to encourage players - someone who owns the game can play with a non-owner online if necessary. Yet Masahiro Sakurai drew some amusement on social media over the weekend with his take on playing the game solo.

The town management game has its own cryptocurrency, of course, and this weekend they sold NFTs of virtual land for real money. The hope for crypto land barons is that they would be able to earn money back from other players through in-game business partnerships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windjammers 2 has been a long-time coming (it was first announced in 2018) and after years of betas, the sequel to the cult-favorite arcade game officially launches next month. 
That would be January 20, to be exact. As for platforms, Windjammers 2 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. It’s also launching day one on Xbox Game Pass. Physical versions are also on the way courtesy of Limited Run Games, though it’s unclear if those will launch day and date with the digital editions. 
Windjammers features a roster of 10 characters, both originals and newcomers, and 10 courts to host the disc-throwing action. Like the 1994 original, two players battle out in what’s essentially over-the-top air hockey with frisbees. Lobbing the disc into the other player’s goal is key, and each character sports their own playstyle and special attacks. Windjammers 2 features new gameplay mechanics, an arcade mode, and online play with casual and ranked matches. Get the full rundown in the new trailer below.

Windjammers 2 is being developed by Dotemu, the team behind Streets of Rage 4 and publisher for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge.

The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game's community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims' supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we've had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what's the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they're not well cool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chocobo GP is racing through the finish line in just a few months. 
More specifically, you can race as a Chocobo, your favorite Final Fantasy summon, heroes such as Terra, or someone else entirely when Chocobo GP hits Switch on March 10. That’s less than three months away so you might want to brush up on your kart racing skills soon. And if you’re looking for a great way to do that, look no further than Nintendo’s own Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, because Chocobo GP looks very, very similar in almost every regard. 
Click here to watch embedded media


From the item boxes, err, Magicites, placed throughout the track to the track design and even the way racers drift, Chocobo GP looks very much like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Look, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is arguably the best kart racer out there so it’s not surprising to see another racer take on a similar shape. Plus, if Final Fantasy is more your franchise versus Mario or any of the others highlighted in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, then Chocobo GP might be your new favorite kart racer. 
Today’s March 10 release date news was announced in a release date trailer on the Nintendo UK YouTube channel. In it, we get more details about the game, including a brief look at its story mode, some of the characters we can expect to see, and more. We also learn that similar to other kart racers, a series will consist of four races. Although Chocobo GP has its own series ready to go at launch, players can create their own, too. 
The trailer also reveals a quick glimpse at a track we’ve not seen before – you can see it around the 1:26 minute mark and it looks like a Final Fantasy spin on Mario Kart Wii's Moo Moo Meadows. Elsewhere in the trailer, you can see the castle track previously shown in the Chocobo GP announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has some indie games ready to show, and it sounds like we’ll all be getting a glimpse of them during the next Indie World showcase. 
Announced on Twitter today, Nintendo of America says a new Indie World showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. As for what to expect, well, there’s really no telling – considering the name of the event, you can obviously expect to see some indie games, but as for which ones, only Nintendo knows.
Get ready for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase arriving Wednesday, Dec. 15 at 9:00 a.m. PT!
#NintendoSwitch.

Perhaps we’ll finally get some more information about Hollow Knight: Silksong, which was revealed in February 2019 as DLC that transformed into a full-blown sequel. 
We may also learn more about Sports Story, another hotly-anticipated indie game announced over two years ago. There’s a chance we don’t see Sports Story or Silksong, though, so don’t let the hype train leave the station just yet. Other possibilities include Metal Slug Tactics, Lumbearjack, and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, all of which were shown back in August’s Indie World Showcase. 
Nintendo says this Indie World showcase will run for 20 minutes, and if it’s anything like previous Indie World showcases, it will, as the name implies, be focused on indie games … so don’t expect to see Breath of the Wild 2 or Splatoon 3 here. For a look at what was previously shown during the last Indie World showcase, which happened back in August, check out Game Informer’s full breakdown. 
Are you excited about tomorrow’s Indie World Showcase? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Current and former employees of the Destiny developers claim they've experienced "overt sexism, boys' club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard". CEO Pete Parsons has since issued an apology "on behalf of everyone at Bungie", acknowledging that the studio needs to listen to these accounts, and do better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update, 12/13/21:
Thunder Lotus has revealed that Spiritfarer has surpassed 1 million copies sold, a massive milestone for the indie game, and if that's not enough, the latest and final update, the Jackie & Daria Update, is out today. 
For more details about the Jackie & Daria Update, check out the original story below. 
Original Story, 12/13/21:
Spiritfarer is getting the final batch of content from its 2021 roadmap, and developer Thunder Lotus bills it as the most significant addition yet. Jackie and Daria are two new spirits joining the fray alongside an uncharted island to explore and a new event. 
The free update arrives on December 13 for all versions of the game. The story sees Stella visit a rundown hospital situated on an unknown island. She meets Jackie, a caretaker and spirit in the form of a hyena, and Daria, a bat and Jackie’s patient. By befriending these two lovable spirits, you’ll help them get the hospital up and running again. As seen in the trailer below, the update adds a new platforming-focused event, and you outfit your ferry with new upgrades.

As previously noted, the Jackie & Daria update will be the game’s last. Two previous add-ons introduced two other spirits, Lily and Beverly, and their respective stories. Now that Spiritfaer is wrapped up, we look forward to seeing what Thunder Lotus has up its sleeve next. 
Spiritfarer is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. You can read our review here to find out why it’s a gem you shouldn’t overlook.]]></summary>

First shown during an Xbox event held earlier this year, The Anacrusis carries with it some sci-fi Left 4 Dead vibes – be it the hordes of aliens, the four-player co-op elements, or the fact that it’s an FPS, The Anacrusis seems like a day-one game for anyone that’s a fan of Valve’s zombie shooter. Oh, and Anacrusis developer Stray Bombay was co-founded by Left 4 Dead lead developer, Chet Faliszek.

But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.
The Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard employees are becoming increasingly frustrated with the company, holding walkouts in the wake of damning reports and layoffs. It's reached a point where ABK employees are organising a formal strike, and there's been talk of unionisation - talk that ActiBlizz would like to stop. In an internal email, chief administrative officer Brian Bulatao discourages staff from signing an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union (CWA) - because "active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees" is better than unionisation, apparently.

        <updated>2021-12-13T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch has been the best-selling console in the U.S. for 35 of the last 36 months, having lost to the PlayStation 5 back in September. The streak continued this November. 
Announced in a press release today, the Switch was the best-selling console in the U.S. in November after selling more than 1 million units. The press release cites the NPD Group, which regularly reports on U.S. video games sales each month, and according to the group, the Switch sold 1.13 million units last month. Of course, those 1.13 million units are split between the three variants of the console currently on the market: the Switch, the Switch Lite, and the OLED Model, which was just released in October.

“For the important holiday-shopping week of Thanksgiving, which includes Black Friday, Nintendo Switch was also the top-selling video game console, with nearly 550,000 systems sold,” the press release reads. “With November logged in the record books, Nintendo Switch has now been the top-selling video game console for 35 out of the last 36 months.” 
Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who recently appeared at The Game Award 2021 to accept the Best Action/Adventure Game award for Metroid Dread, says as Nintendo heads into 2022 and the sixth year of Switch, “the system continues to see strong demand” and that the company looks “forward to even more people adding Nintendo Switch to their households.”

However, in a new Xbox-focused documentary, Microsoft seems to regret how it handled Lionhead, as reported by IGN. 
Power On: The Story of Xbox was announced back in November, and now, the six-part documentary is available for viewing. Running over four hours long, this documentary series covers the entire history of Xbox, including its closure of Lionhead five years ago. Xbox general manager of global games publishing, Shannon Loftis, revealed how the company considered this closure and how it was handled.

It's a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead's Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

According to supposed screenshots and store info, it's an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.

Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon launches tomorrow and offers an intriguing change of pace for everyone’s favorite shovel-wielding hero/obligatory indie cameo star. After countless matches, I can say its action-oriented spin on tile-matching puzzle games works well. Assuming you can put up with a surprisingly steep difficulty curve, Pocket Dungeon is worth checking out if you’re looking for a new puzzler to chip away at. 
Pocket Dungeon’s boards feature descending tiles, which can be monsters, obstacles, health potions, and other items you must prevent from stacking to the top by clearing matching tiles adjacent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography has explored the history of the Metroid series, but it's time to wrap the season by talking about, arguably, the biggest Nintendo game of the year: Metroid Dread.
On October 8, 2021, Metroid Dread was released for Nintendo's Switch. Nintendo heralded the title as the end of an era for the series, but considering how well it's selling, it could also be the beginning of another golden age. Oddly, Dread might have one of the longest teases in history, as its name first appeared back in 2005. In this week's show, we talk about our problems with the game's controls, what we thought of the difficulty, and what its big narrative reveal means for Samus' future. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, soon-to-be-GameSpot-editor Jessica Howard (@awildjessichu) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Dread's lore, development history, and lasting impact. 
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

In it, you play as super sniper Karl Fairburne, who is on a mission to take out high-ranking officers and find out the secret to something called Project Kraken.

Karl's adventures through the French cities and countrysides won't be pleasant, and he'll have to rely on more than his sharpshooting skills to stay alive. The debut trailer shows plenty of weaponry at Fairburne's disposal, like automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and good old-fashioned knives. Returning is the gruesome x-ray effect on devastating neck stabs or pinpoint accurate sniper shots that cause the target's internals to explode spectacularly. 
Last night, keen-eyed viewers of The Game Awards might have spotted Sniper Elite 5 on the list of upcoming day one Game Pass releases. The game is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2022.

It's simultaneously a bit Wind Waker, a bit Breath Of The Wild, and a bit Disney. This year's trailer has all of the above, plus more of the animal and object possession and the ways you can use it in combat. Lovely stuff. Watch it below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn was one of the first games announced for the Xbox Series X/S, but we still don’t know a ton about it, and it vanished from the limelight for over a year. Developer Ebb Software has finally spoken up to remind us that Scorn is still very much happening – in fact, it’s arriving next October. 
A cryptic trailer revealed the release window but didn’t divulge any new plot or gameplay details. A new community post on the game’s Kickstarter page only offers a behind-the-scenes look at the game’s art direction.

Ebb CEO Ljubomi Peklar issued a statement on the game, saying: 
“We’re really pleased to be able to share more news on the game and its release date. Scorn has been a real work of passion for the entire studio. The atmosphere, the journey, and the experience, we want every moment in Scorn to elicit an emotional response and feeling. It is our hope that Scorn stays with players long after they reach its ending. We’re looking forward to sharing more news and updates with our community as we move closer to launch”
So far, we know that Scorn is a first-person shooter set within a labyrinthine world heavily inspired by the art of H.R. Giger. The pulsating walls and grotesque enemies send the appropriate shivers up our spines, and we’re glad to see the project still has a pulse. The last time we saw Scorn in action was in a 14-minute gameplay demo that you can watch here.
Scorn is launching to Xbox Series X/S and PC.]]></summary>

Among the numerous announcements to come out of The Game Awards, The Matrix Awakens was one of the coolest as well as the most puzzling. Not quite a game, per see, this free interactive experience serves as a tech demo to showcase Unreal Engine 5's horsepower using The Matrix universe as a backdrop. To say that it looks great is an understatement. We're still trying to lift our jaws off the floor thanks to the life-like fidelity of Awakens' city. 
Awakens puts you in control of an original character, though you do get to hang with Neo and Trinity during an exciting on-rails car chase/shooting gallery that we'll partially show off. You'll also get a glimpse at how Awakens lets players tinker with development tools to alter the look and feel of its world. 
Join Alex Stadink, Marcus Stewart, and Andrew Reiner as they delve into The Matrix Awakens' stunning digital playground. Be sure to check out our round-up of all the big announcements from The Game Awards, as well as the full list of award winners.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony's first-party efforts grew stronger today with the acquisition of Seattle-based developer, Valkyrie Entertainment. Since 2002, Valkyrie has worked on over 100 games, often serving the role of co-developer or content creator. In a tweet, Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, said Valkyrie "will be making invaluable contributions to key PlayStation Studios franchises."
Valkyrie has worked with Sony several times in the past, helping bring Infamous, God of War, and Twisted Metal to market. The developer will once again be working with Sony Santa Monica on God of War: Ragnarok. 
In a press release issued earlier today, a Sony spokesperson outlined the path forward. "The day-to-day operations post-acquisition will continue to be run by Valkyrie Entertainment’s current management team. Terms of this transaction including the acquisition cost are not disclosed due to contractual commitments."
Along with the acquisition, Valkyrie has a big reason to celebrate, as it was one of the studios involved in helping create Halo Infinite, the fantastic sequel that we awarded a review of 9.25 out of 10. Other games that have Valkyrie's touch are pictured in the image above.
Sony and Microsoft are in a bit of an arms race, snatching up developers over the last few years to broaden their respective first-party game development efforts.]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-12-10T19:54:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another regional form for Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been announced, and this time it's a new version of Voltorb.
Typically a pure electric type, the Hisuian Voltorb is grass and electric, joining Rotom Mow as the only two Pokémon that share the two elements. Like its gen-1 predecessor, Hisuian Voltorb still resembles a Pokéball, only now, instead of looking metallic and grumpy, this sphere has angular, joyful eyes and wood grain throughout its lower half. The design is somewhat closer to the Pokéballs you'll find or craft while playing Legends: Arceus. It has a mysterious opening on the top of its head, which the Pokémon website says spouts seeds, though "it’s impossible to see anything even if one peers into the hole.​" When this Voltorb gets excited or feels like it's in danger, that same hole is the source of discharged electricity.

Along with the announcement of Hisuian Voltorb, The Pokémon Company has released an adorable stop-motion animated short featuring the two-toned orb cheerfully irritating a Pikachu, Spheal, and Buneary. The video ends with a "to be continued," so hopefully, we'll learn more about Voltorb or its potential Hisuian Electrode evolution in the next one. With so many types of Pokéballs out there, with various designs and colors, I'd love to see a bunch of variations of Voltorb to match the look of a Quick Ball or a Nest Ball.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a semi-open world adventure where players step back in time to explore the Hisui region, which we now know as Sinnoh from Diamond and Pearl. Trainers take a more active role in battle and catching wild Pokémon, bringing the concept of the franchise a little further from its purely turn-based roots. Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches for Nintendo Switch on January 28, 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2019’s Bury Me, My Love offered one of the most uniquely told narratives in recent memory (not to mention being quite emotional). We’ve been curious as to what developer The Pixel Hunt had up its sleeve next, and we found out yesterday with the reveal of its next project, The Wreck.
The Wreck is billed as a mature 3D visual novel. It stars a failed screenwriter named Junon who must relive one of the most important and, if the trailer is any indication, traumatizing days of her life. The Pixel Hunt describes the story as a tale about “sisterhood, motherhood, grief, and survival.”

In terms of gameplay, you’ll converse with a small cast of characters to explore Junon’s past in a non-linear story. With Junon dealing with emotional stress and her mother in critical condition, revisiting and coming to terms with a challenging past and present sounds easier said than done. Though the trailer establishes the tone,  the gallery of screenshots below provides a better idea of how moment-to-moment gameplay appears and the game's dream-like quality.

The game joins the service sometime in January, but there's no exact date as of yet. The 1998 platformer is widely remembered as a standout game for the N64 (especially for third-party games) and among the most beloved games of the era overall. While the emulation of the Expansion Pack hasn’t been universally loved, it’s cool to see Banjo-Kazooie making its way back to the house of N. Given that Microsoft owns Rare, the only way to play Banjo was on Xbox, such as in the Rare Replay collection.

Beneath exhilarating rollercoaster rides and silly conversations with squirrels, It Takes Two has a heavy heart. It’s about divorce and the toll taken on a daughter who doesn’t want to lose her family. It’s about decaying love and the differences that divide us. It’s about not wanting to face reality and not wanting to let go. It’s also about hope and uncertainty, the past creating a better future, and finding common ground no matter how much it may hurt. All of these elements are beautifully woven into a colorful and soulful adventure that hits hard, both in its moving narrative an…]]></summary>

I’m in the car on the way to badminton and I’m listening to the song Dynasties & Dystopia from Arcane, the show based on League Of Legends. In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While not as flashy as a new 4K monitor or one of the best graphics cards, an SSD can make a surprisingly big difference to your PC gaming experience. Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.

The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.


With its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can't really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.

Still, last night at The Game Awards we all got a first look at Star Wars Eclipse in the form of a cinematic trailer. And let's be honest: that trailer is cracking. It's really good. And it's so good that I think we all need to remember that there is absolutely no way QD aren't going to spectacularly boot this.

Eventually I will reach a row of grey filing cabinets, locate the right drawer, and tug it open, the scream of rusted metal echoing through the dark room.
I will spend some time rifling through the papers within, growing more and more frantic as I hear the slow tread of heavy footsteps approaching. I must find the right file, but also I must escape in time! I haven't been caught yet. Today I escaped with the fifth episode of The Nate Files supporters-only podcast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, Matthew and I will be browsing BBC iPlayer in our never-ending search for something to watch and we'll get served up some clips from the Live From The BBC comedy series. It's a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. 
He's one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There's plenty of that nonsense in Ewins' set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a motorist in south west England, chances are you've probably encountered (or at least heard of) Swindon's Magic Roundabout. It's a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I'm not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London's equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham's Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. 
It's the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you'll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there's one challenge that's truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About five hours into Icarus, the new survival game from Day Z’s Dean Hall and co, I had a moment. I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. 


That’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger's cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.

The trailer is a series of clips, each averaging about 3 seconds long, of different people shooting different guns and rockets and so on. So it's technically a gameplay trailer in the way that loads of different corpses stitched together is a person (no comments from Frankenstein fans). Still, aside from confirming the new release date of August 23rd next year, I think this trailer also confirms that the new city of Santo Ileso is going to be the star of this game. Check out the trailer below to agree with me.

He can run around in an open world now, no longer restrained by specific paths which cause him to inexplicably die when he steps a toe off of them. I am, of course, talking about the newly announced Sonic Frontiers. The next 3D Sonic game is set to arrive late 2022, and we got our first glimpse of it at The Game Awards tonight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken, a game whose name I will never pronounce correctly but was once known as Project Athia, finally has a concrete release date. Announced tonight at The Game Awards, Square Enix's big action RPG adventure will be hitting PC on May 24th 2022. I guess that technically still counts as 'spring' and therefore doesn't constitute a delay on its previous launch window, but it sure is a lot closer to summer than I was expecting. In any case, there's a shiny new trailer with some very hammy villains to enjoy at the same time.

My interest was piqued when I saw it's being made by Monolith, the studio behind F.E.A.R. and the Middle-Earth: Shadow Of Mordor series. Then I saw OH WAIT it's using that wonderful patented Nemesis System which breathes personality and history into enemies? I'm in. Fully. Let's go.

Not only are there giant skull bosses with lasers bursting out of their eye sockets, but some of the creatures you'll face in the Tower Of Babylon look suspiciously like Nier: Automata-style bullet-hell boys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days removed from the launch of Halo Infinite, we finally have our first look at Halo The Series, the long-awaited Paramount+ adaptation of gaming's favorite Spartan.
While there aren't any ring-like space mechanisms the games are named for, the initial peek at Halo The Series gave us plenty to be excited about. It features plenty of Spartans, interstellar asteroid civilizations, and most importantly, Master Chief doing a cool, heroic landing and pose in the sand. 
Dr. Halsey narrates the piece, likely speaking to John-117 about how she's counting on him to be special and he gives people hope. We get some beautiful shots of human cities, Chief exploring some stony ruins, and what looks to be a brilliantly-lit alien structure. The Covenant is said to play a large role as an antagonist in the series, though we don't catch a glimpse of the coalition of extraterrestrial races quite yet.

Halo The Series is produced in coordination with Showtime, Amblin Television, and 343 Industries. It stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117,  Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, Bokeem Woodbine as Soren-066, and Jen Taylor reprising her role as the AI Cortana. The show hits Paramount+ sometime in 2022.

Arc Raiders is an upcoming free-to-play cooperative shooter by Embark Studios, which is comprised of previous DICE employees who worked on the Battlefield series. Embark took to The Game Awards to unveil its project, Arc Raiders, offering our first big look at the game in action.
With Robyn's "Dancing On My Own" serving as the trailer's anthem, we were introduced to deadly mechanized threats coming from space that must be brought down with the cooperation of your squad. Plenty of gunfire and explosions naturally ensue. But then the trailer shows humongous mechanized beings that take up the entire screen, giving the fights a David versus Goliath feel. You are playing as the underdog and must work together with your team to shoot off enemy parts and make sure everyone stays alive. In one cool scene, a character launches toward the giant being and chucks a grenade right at its center. The trailer ends by saying: "They will never stop coming," and shows an armored baddie with red eyes rising. You can watch it for yourself above.
The game's description on Steam says players will wield tools and gadgets to outsmart the enemy and use physics to their advantage for success. 
Arc Raiders is set to come out in 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

This seems like it would be the game's opening cinematic so if you watch this trailer now, hey, it's almost as if you're starting Elden Ring two months early. Almost.

Today at The Game Awards 2021, we were treated to yet another taste of what's to come. Suppose you're looking for more information on Elden Ring. In that case, you might want to check out an extensive write-up of everything we discovered in hours and hours of wandering around the Network Test – or join us on video for some hot and spicy commentary. Today, players got a little more context about the world that From Software and G.R.R. Martin have created for Elden Ring. Check out the entire trailer below.

The trailer details the downfall of the demigods, with some style and flair. Wars raged between the demigods, with a grand battle between two champions. A mysterious character narrates the whole thing, and all it does is raise more questions. Well, hopefully, we'll have some answers – and can start exploring – soon enough.
What do you think this means for Elden Ring? After Bloodborne's mid-game surprise shift, I think everyone's anticipating that there are plenty of exciting secrets in store. These games are often better experienced without a full spoiler suite. Still, it's likely that any big revelations and surprises will be saved for post-launch as we continue to see parts and pieces stitched together from the early-game experience. What did you think of the trailer? Let us know in the comments! Elden Ring is slated to land on February 25, 2022 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal 5 Experience has officially been revealed and it’s available to experience on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S right now. 
Revealed during The Game Awards 2021 by none other than Keanu Reeves, who plays Neo in the Matrix franchise, and Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinity, this experience is a visual showcase of what Unreal Engine 5 is capable of. During The Game Awards 2021, Reeves and Moss were found in front of the iconic dodge-a-bullet-by-bending-really-far-backwards-scene from the first Matrix movie.

Reeves jokes that he can’t pull off moves like that anymore, but he says in Unreal Engine 5, he can. Then, we see some footage from Matrix Resurrections, which oddly enough features footage from The Matrix, too. From there, we returned to Reeves and Moss, who ask, “what is a game and what is a movie?”
Following this, the duo revealed the world premiere of The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience and it was quite impressive, if not a touch veering into uncanny valley territory.

It turns out that this experience is playable and seems to take place during a scene in which Neo and Trinity are dodging enemies while racing down a street. We haven’t played it yet, but if we had to guess, it plays like a shooter of sorts. It appears to be a tech demo with playable elements.

We got a taste of his music as it played over the game's trailer, which shows a character riding atop some kind of robotic horse throughout a desert. As this happens, the character is chased by a group of rocket-powered, spider-like creates. The trailer ends with the character thrown from their horse, as small, cat-like creature paws at them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Techland's Dying Light 2 Stay Human got a new trailer during The Game Awards, showcasing some of the grim realities of the harsh world coming next February. Not only does the trailer serve up an impressive visual showcase, but it also highlights one of the most significant conflicts that can happen in the myriad hypothetical zombie apocalypse scenarios, where humans are at each other's throats as one of the most dangerous threats of all. It's almost like one of the challenges in these survival scenarios is to stay human despite society and the world crumbling into chaos. Oh wait, they put that in the title just in case we forgot. Nice! Anyway, check out this cool trailer that explores some pretty gruesome and grim stuff. Zombies are scary, and tough choices will be made in this game for sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced at The Game Awards, Rumbleverse is an upcoming third-person last-man-standing brawler published by Epic Games and developed by Iron Galaxy Games (who've previously worked on the Killer Instinct series, as well as the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro PC ports). I attended a hands-off preview, and it sure does look like a cartoony battle royale. The most standout thing to me was that you could put an entire cooked chicken in your pocket, or throw it at someone, so that's something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not normally a fan of children in games because, as noted in this episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, they get into the uncanny valley pretty quickly.
