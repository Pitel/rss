        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sennheiser HD 599 SE has been one of my favourite pairs of headphones for a long time, with its open-back design, neutral sound signature and comfy velour earpads combining into one of the best affordable headsets for critical listening and gaming in my book. These headphones normally hover around £100 to £180, but today they've dropped to a near-all-time-low: £87 at Amazon UK.

I'm not usually one to watch streamers or YouTubers play the games I like, but every once in a while, someone will come along with a gimmick that re-contextualizes my love of various titles. Speedrunners will often grab my attention with their insanely in-depth knowledge of their favorite game, and I was a big fan earlier this year of a Twitch Streamer called DeanoBeano who got some amazing snipes in Call of Duty: Warzone using a recorder as a controller.
My new favorite creator is also a purveyor of some sweet Warzone content -- his name is @slaterkodish on all his various socials, and while he streams every day, my absolute favorite are his TikToks.

Hot on the heels of the 7-Star Charizard Tera Raid, Cinderace is the second 7-Star challenge introduced in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. If you thought Charizard was hard, you’ve got another thing coming.
Just like before, you can only catch one Cinderace during this event. However, you can farm the encounter as much as you’d like for sky-high drop rates of Tera Shards and other rare items. Cinderace will always have the Fighting Tera-Type and the same movepool, so building a Pokemon to counter it specifically is essential.

Every December, I, like many others, take a look back at the biggest games of the year. Usually, I limit myself to the games that I actually liked, but this year, I dipped my toes into Horizon Forbidden West, a sequel that I don't care for to a game that I don't care for. I also watched a few YouTube videos of God of War Ragnarök. I was going to play it in full, but Horizon Forbidden West put me off of paying full price for sequels to games I dislike (and 2018's God of War left me pretty cold). I just wanted to get a feel for the year's big trends. What I discovered was one major through-line: distressingly talkative characters.
I am not the first to make this observation. Most people, Destructoid's Chris Carter included, liked Horizon Forbidden West more than I di…]]></summary>

I hold no side-scroller in higher regard than the original Castlevania on the NES. It’s not the flashiest or more feature-stuffed game, but what it does, it does almost perfectly. The bosses could be better, I guess. However, perfection is a constantly shifting target, so I’ll take Castlevania as the closest we’ll ever get to it.
It’s probably why I prefer the classic formula of the Castlevania series over the later “Metroidvania” approach. Not that I have any distaste for it, but my preference is that tough-as-nails, level-by-level setup. It makes my thumbs feel like they’re flexing.
However, I’ve never met a Castlevania I love more than the first, and I’ve played most of them. The closest I’ve come to the same admiration was actually with Castlevania: Bl…]]></summary>

Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. 
The first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light.

I know I'm not alone in saying that it was really difficult to narrow down my choices for my favorites games of the year. I wanted to have a clean top ten, but I've had so much fun this year I had to make way for a few extras.

Sonic the Hedgehog has certainly made his presence known these past 12 months — So much so, that Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka believes that 2022 might have just witnessed "The biggest year in Sonic history."
Speaking in a developer round-up article in Famitsu, Iizuka points to various successful multimedia projects featuring The Blue Blur and his pals. These include Paramount Pictures' hugely successful sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sega's major PC and console release Sonic Frontiers, retro compilation Sonic Origins, and the recent Netflix animated series Sonic Prime. And that's not to mention the launch of the new Sonic LEGO line, which debuted almost one year ago to the day.
Riding high off of new interest in the iconic Sega mascot, Iizuka notes that Sonic Team is far from done with the series, and hopes to continue this wave of new multimedia endeavors well into 2023 and beyond. As good as 2022 has been for Sonic and pals, it looks like the coming year intend to build upon the series new and veteran fanbase.
"We are preparing a second wave to keep the fans happy and maintain that momentum going into 2023," notes Iizuka. "We already announced additional content for Sonic Frontiers, but there is a lot more outside of that, so please look forward to it."
Sonic Frontiers and Sonic Origins are available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Meanwhile, Sonic Prime is now available to watch exclusively on Netflix.

It feels like a bit of a copout to say "2022 was an interesting year for video games," because every year is an interesting year for video games... but, well, 2022 was an interesting year for video games! It was the first year in which I really felt like I could see 2020's production setbacks on the release calendar, but it was also a year for projects that seemed like they would never arrive. Who would have guessed that Dwarf Fortress would reach 1.0 and Live A Live would get its official English localization in the same year?

Over the holidays we're republishing some choice features from the last 12 months. A mix of talking points, interviews, opinion pieces and more from NL staff and contributors, you'll find our usual blend of thoughtfulness, expertise, frivolity, retro nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Happy holidays!

Monolith Soft has become one of the most recognisable of Nintendo's first-party developers in recent times. Led by legendary RPG writer and director Tetsuya Takahashi, the studio is renowned for the monolithic (pun intended) Xenoblade series. Combining MMORPG-style, memorable worlds, stunning music, and philosophical writing, the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise has taken the world by storm. Monolith Soft's history, however, is as monolithic as its now-flagship series.

The Cinderace Tera Raid is live in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and it'll run for two full weekends (December 30 - January 1, and January 13-January 15). Unfortunately, it once again requires folks to be in what I can only describe as a "deep endgame position," as it's a 7-star raid that requires a bit of finesse to complete. Here's where to find it!
Do the legwork to unlock high-end raids first
Just like Charizard, you'll need to finish the game, then do a bit of postgame to actually earn the right to take on 7-star (and 6-star) raids.  We have a full guide on how to unlock them here.
Once you do that though, you can farm them constantly! Just know that you should also have a highly trained level 100 Pokemon to bring in too. Slowbro has been…]]></summary>

Sakurai felt that if he is just continuously making games full time, and his life will be over before he realizes it."

It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I've had ideas, and terrible when I've not. I'm still feeling it out, settling in, and making mistakes, but I'm quite enjoying myself. Hopefully you have enjoyed some of it too. Here are a few of my favourite things I've written this year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it's currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.
Check out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below:

As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA['We need 1 more week to ensure quality'
Although folks on the majority of Stardew Valley platforms have been enjoying update 1.5 for quite a while now, the mobile edition still needs one final push. That was supposed to come by the end of the year, but a new tweet from developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has some insight into the final, final deadline for the patch.
Here's the full context from the tweet:
"MOBILE: The porting team and I have been working extremely hard this past week on the 1.5 update. We're so close. We could probably release right now. But we need 1 more week to ensure quality. I accept full responsibility for not hitting the end of year target."

As far as I'm concerned: no worries! Stardew Valley has earned so much good will at this point, that folks can wait a bit more for an update. It helps that the game is also on basically every platform under the sun, so there are options available.
That said, it's admirable to see Barone taking responsibility, even if it's not needed. This whole saga has been a masterclass on transparency and communication; and how developers can opt to treat their fans in an era of nonsense, especially given how Stardew basically gives everything out for free.

We've had plenty of retro compilations and collections come to consoles over the past few years, some of them mightily impressive, others incredibly lacklustre. While 2022 saw plenty of companies repackage old releases into pleasant nostalgia parcels, it also felt like the beginning of a new phase, with big names in the industry finally starting to realise the value — beyond the mere monetary — of investing in their history and letting talented developers present it with the care and attention it deserves.

Mediatonic has launched one final event to round out the 2022 season of its madcap multiplayer title, Fall Guys — Now available on all platforms, the coming weekend will give Disney-lovin' beans the opportunity to bag three character skins pulled from the studio's excellent 2021 feature, Encanto.
Three members of the Madrigal family have received the battle royale bean treatment, namely the quirky Mirabel, the mysterious Uncle Bruno (complete with rat!), and, everybody's favorite, the mighty Luisa! In addition, a new Wearable allows players to don the Madrigal Miracle Candle — a symbol of pure love that is able to bestow seemingly impossible magic on the family's descendants. Just watch out for hot wax on the ol' noggin.

In addition to these four skins, players can also purchase two new emotes — featuring some sweet dance steps, as well as a selection of nicknames and nameplates. The Fall Guys Encanto DLC is available to purchase from the Fall Guys in-game store from now until January 3, so move fast if you want to make sure that Luisa finds her way to the crown. And woe betide anybody standing in her way.
Oh, and if you haven't seen Encanto, perhaps check it out this weekend. It's marvelous.
Fall Guys is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

The first Cinderace weekend is upon us in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and it brings its huge stats and fighting Tera type along with it. Here's a quick breakdown of its stats, and the loot you can gain from defeating it. For reference, my first takedown was with an Azumarill, with a team of three Slowbros.
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="356157,356158"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Cinderace loot list
After taking down the 7-star Cinderace raid, I saw another gigantic loot explosion: similar to the one with Charizard. 7-star raids drop quite a few items, and here's a preview of what you could earn.
Here's what I got on my first clear (you can find the first-drop list directly above: note that this is not a set drop list):
Ability Capsule x 1
EXP Candy L x 39 (!)
EXP Candy XL x 4
Protein x10
Fighting Tera Shard x15
TM 064 x1
Ability Patch x1
[gallery link="file" columns="2" size="large" ids="356241,356240"]
And here is what I got on my second clear (directly above).
[gallery link="file" size="large" ids="356159,356160,356161"]
Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Cinderace moves and stats
As promised ahead of launch, this Cinderace is a fighting Tera type (which can be changed), and is a fire type normally. Clocking in at level 100, the 7-star Cinderace came with the following moves (and the Libero ability):
High Jump Kick (10/10)
Pyro Ball (5/5)
Acrobatics (15/15)
Iron Head (15/15)
And the following stats:
HP - 301
Sp. Atk - 149
Sp. Def - 186
Speed - 274
Defense - 186
Attack - 294
Does the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Cinderace count as a Paldean Pokedex entry?
Just like Charizard, the answer seems to be no. After catching one (and hatching the family tree), my Pokedex remained the same.

So in case you missed it, the exclusive 7-star raid Pokemon can be used for breeding. For roughly a week it never really dawned on me to try to bring Charizard along on a picnic, but eventually I thought "why not give it a go?" I ended up giving out Charmanders to all my friends, and the same can be done with Cinderace. Here's some stats and info.
[caption id="attachment_356168" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]
Just bring Cinderace and Ditto to a picnic, and you can have one too
As was the case with Charizard, the egg hatching scheme is exactly the same. Just bring Cinderace and Ditto to a picnic, use an egg-boosting sandwich if you want, and let the eggs roll in.
If you need a refresh, we have a full guide on where to find Ditto here, and a comprehensive guide on egg hatching here.

In Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, Scorbunny still evolves into Raboot at level 16, and Cinderace at level 35
The evolutionary track is the same in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, so you can get the entire line if you want. It evolves into Raboot at level 16, and Cinderace at level 35. Although the raid requirements say you can "only catch one Cinderace per save file," you can breed as many eggs as you want.
By default, a hatched Scorbunny comes with the following moves:
Tackle (35/35)
Growl (40/40)
High Jump Kick (10/10)

Over the holidays we're republishing some choice features from the last 12 months. A mix of talking points, interviews, opinion pieces and more from NL staff and contributors, you'll find our usual blend of thoughtfulness, expertise, frivolity, retro nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Happy holidays!

Ah, the venerable midnight launch. The once-expected tradition of camping out for midnight game launches — so timed as to technically adhere to official game street dates while still capitalising on gamer obsessions and enthusiasm — is, at least in New York City, on the verge of extinction thanks to numerous factors like public safety, liability concerns, pandemic precautions, and overall consumer welfare.

When every year has so many more than 24 good games, I always tried to tactically vote and reshuffle points to wedge in a few wee great games I knew not many people had played. But with a change to voting procedure this year, I simply couldn't get some games on our list. So, here are the games I would've slammed into our advent calendar if I were still allowed to cheat, along with some that simply didn't quite make the cut.

        <updated>2022-12-30T13:57:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that "2023 will be a year of many announcements," as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said "Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements," and that his keyword for 2023 is "long-awaited," as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The thrill of victory... and the agony of defeat!".
Back in 2017, the Switch library was still in its infancy and this relative lack of competition led to indie projects like Blossom Tales and Blaster Master Zero having far more visibility than they perhaps would in the current, more crowded marketplace. Another big early winner on the eShop was Golf Story, a goofy and quirky take on a golfing RPG that brought to mind Game Boy Color's excellent Mario Golf and proved to be surprisingly appealing to a wide audience. To capitalize on this newfound success, Sidebar Games soon announced a sequel, Sports Story, which would be expanding the gameplay to other sports like BMX biking, soccer (no, it’s not called football), and tennis. After over five years, this hotly anticipated sequel has finally arrived, shadow-dropped two days before Christmas, and… well, it’s alright. Sports Story isn’t a bad game by any means, but it is a supremely disappointing one considering what it could have been.
Sports Story follows your character from Golf Story going on a scenic trip with their coach and friends to an island that evidently has a lot of budget for sporting activities. Though you come there to play golf, it’s not long before you start getting swept up into academies and competitions in a whole host of other sports.

Images of a special edition Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch OLED Model have surfaced online, with photos of a Zelda-themed dock and set of Joy-Con, plus the box.
Apparently found on the Chinese forum Tieba and posted to Famiboards by user Kysen (thanks, My Nintendo News), they show a pair of gold Joy-Con sporting green (left) and white (right) motifs from the game and white rear panels to match the dock. The dock has similar gold markings emblazoned across the front, with the rear of the console itself (black) featuring subtly embossed motifs similar to those found on other special edition OLED consoles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When will the fog clear..?
Top tier spoilers The Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee is at it again, this time fanning the flames of rumor on a mysterious and as-yet-unannounced title in the Silent Hill series. Silent Hill: The Short Message has been newly rated for PS5, following on from its previous rating in Korea back in September.
The curious element here is that The Short Message was not one of the titles listed during Konami's Silent Hill Transmission presentation, held by the studio back in October of this year. The live stream contained several new titles pertaining to games, films, and even an interactive streaming project, but "The Short Message" was not among them.
Perhaps this mysterious release pertains to a prologue demo — dare I say, a "Playable Teaser" — for one of the newly announced titles. Until Konami is ready to show its hand, we'll just have to wait and see.
Still, with Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake on the horizon, not to mention Silent Hill: Ascension, Silent Hill: Townfall, and period piece adventure Silent Hill: F, it seems that fans of fog and monsters have plenty of unholy horrors headed their way in the coming years. You better make sure your flashlight is well stocked up on batteries — and I don't mean that "50 for £1" deal from the local market.

We're so close to the end of 2022, and as part of this, Capcom is currently hosting a special end-of-year survey - reflecting on another year of gaming, and what's ahead for the company in 2023. If you do happen to be a fan, you might want to let them know how you're feeling by participating.
The usual questions about country, age and the consoles you own pop up, and this is followed by a series of questions about the Capcom franchises you play, what games you're looking forward to next year and what you also played in 2022.

Ash Ketchum's current VA, Sarah Natochenny, has already shared a brief message on Twitter mentioning how it's been an "extraordinary privilege" to voice the character for 17 years, and she's now elaborated on this in a separate post on Instagram:

Sega has had its high and low points over the years, but perhaps the most challenging moment in its history was the company's exit from the console market in 2001. Despite this uphill battle at the time, it still managed to pump out several amazing games, and even some new franchises that captured the hearts of Sega fans around the world.
One new IP, in particular, around the early 2000s was Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg - starting out life in 2003 as a GameCube exclusive. The 3D platformer was led by director Shun Nakamura (Sonic Frontiers, Sonic Adventure and Samba De Amigo) and was received somewhat positively by gamers and fans alike. Unfortunately, the title ended up being a commercial failure and there was never any sort of follow-up.

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.
  



      
												
Arc Raiders
Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year's Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…]]></summary>

This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we'd recommend it over the X any time.

This makes it a good performer even in sustained write scenarios, as you might encounter in video editing and the like, while its good random read/write speeds are good for gaming. Sabrent has discounted the drive to £77.99 on Amazon UK, which is a good price for this level of performance.

As seen in a video posted by user Arestame on Twitter, this mod allows players to ride the legendary Pokémon Koraidon around as a mount, dress themselves and enemy characters in Pokémon trainer outfits, and even reskin the game's most ferocious monsters as giant versions of beloved pocket monsters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on track to release sometime next year, and developer GSC Game World has released its first trailer in six months, showcasing gameplay with some narrative trappings along the edges.
Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You should uh, probably grab it
Dishonored - Definitive Edition is live on the Epic Games Store, and is arguably the last big 2022 freebie on the marketplace.
The "kill or not to kill" stealth/action game was originally released in 2012 from Arkane Studios, where it rose to fame very quickly, and helped put Arkane on the map. Shortly after, it hosted some DLC in the form of the Dunwall City Trials (challenge maps), and two story campaigns (Knife of Dunwall, The Brigmore Witches). All of that is included in said Definitive Edition (on top of the Void Walker's Arsenal bonus), which is a pretty great deal: especially given that I liked some elements of the DLC more than the main game. I'd consider this a pretty good New Year's present, and it's definitely worth playing through if you have a rainy holiday weekend coming up.
The promotion went live this morning, and will run through January 5, 2023 at 11:00AM ET. At the moment, Eximius: Seize the Frontline is also available until that exact time, at which point Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics: Aiko's Choice will be cycled in. Those will be available until January 12, 2023. 
You can find Dishonored - Definitive Edition on the Epic Games Store here.

Over the holidays we're republishing some choice features from the last 12 months. A mix of talking points, interviews, opinion pieces and more from NL staff and contributors, you'll find our usual blend of thoughtfulness, expertise, frivolity, retro nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Happy holidays!

As you've probably noticed, GoldenEye 007 is now 25 years old and can legally hire a car in a foreign country. The influence of Rare's seminal shooter on the FPS genre and console video gaming in general is enormous, and gamers have now been poring over it and picking apart its secrets for the last two-and-a-half decades. It stands as a monolith in the gaming landscape, an artifact that's spawned endless investigation, discussion, and debate. What is there left to say?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The biggest takeaway? Quaxly lost
As has been their custom for a while now, Japanese site GameWith ran a massive poll to see what people's favorite Generation 9 (Scarlet & Violet) Pokemon were, and the results were both predictable in some cases, and shocking in others. Let's break it down.
Tinkaton wins big, and Quaxly loses massively
Voting took place from December 16, 2022 through December 23, 2022, and had a total of 177,829 participants. For those of you who are interested, here's a brief overview of the top 10:
Tinkaton
Clodsire
Sprigatito
Fuecoco
Ceruledge
Tatsugiri
Sylveon
Slither Wing
Lucario
Gardevoir
If I had to bet money on it before the fact, I would have predicted Tinkaton in the top 10, especially given the design, type, and overall strength of the newcomer. Seeing a form of Sprigatito and Fuecoco in the mix (the top five no less) makes a lot of sense too. But suspiciously absent from the top 10 (nay, the top 30 entirely) is Quaxly. Many spot polls showed the water starter lagging behind the other two, but this is just something else.
Many other picks are logical. Lucario is still a standout Pokemon and has many many appearances in other media/spinoffs. Sylveon continues to be one of the more popular Eeveelutions, and given its penchant for Tera Raid power, it's a no-brainer in Generation 9. Many folks were also really high on Slither Wing from the jump, and Gardevoir maintaining its popularity was a given.
Going further beyond the top 10, Koraidon (Scarlet) has beaten Miraidon (Violet) as the most popular box legendary, and multiple Eeveelutions made the list, as did Charizard, who is only available via 7-Star Raids. You can find the entire list below!
Here are the most popular Scarlet & Violet Pokemon poll results:

Pokémon Unite continues to bring in new 'mons into its roster, and the last addition in 2022 is none other than Dragapult, the Dragon/Ghost-type from Pokémon Sword & Shield!
Dragapult is a new Ranged Attacker who can use the move 'Dreep and Destroy' to fire two little Dreepy at its opponent. We've always thought that's a little cruel, but they seem to enjoy it (we used it a lot in Sword & Shield). But the attack blast also damages nearby enemies. It can also use Dragon Breath, Dragon Dance, and Phantom Force.

Sports Story got a sudden eShop release this week amid some teases: and really, that's about it! Sports Story is the only featured game this week as far as Nintendo is concerened, but there are a few other offerings to close out the year. Vampire Slayer: The Resurrection (based on a Half-Life mod) is of note, as is the release of Toy Soldiers HD on Switch: which has been a long time coming.
Really though, this is an opportunity to reflect on 2022, and move into 2023 with some lessons learned. Well, maybe not as far as publishers go: they'll keep pushing the limits of what is acceptable in the industry until someone tells them no. So I guess we have that constant to look forward to. Happy New Year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the year’s biggest open-world games, Elden Ring and Pokémon Scarlet have been Frankensteined into one tantalizing entity thanks to the work of one talented modder.
The modder in question goes by the handle Arestame, who tweeted a trailer of their handiwork that drops Scarlet assets into the Lands Between. The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

It’s unclear if this mod will be publicly available to download or if this video is only a proof-of-concept showcase. We’ve reached out to Arestame for clarification and will update this story if we receive a response.

There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. 
No word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three.

However, the big story is that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has surpassed five million physical sales in Japan. That means the game has sold just under one million units a year. And it's still a mainstay in the weekly charts, so those numbers will just keep going up. However, you'll notice that Pokémon is hot on its heels already with over 4.3 million physical copies sold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the end of the road.
It’s only taken 11 games to figure it out, but publisher Nacon has finally realised that numbering its WRC games has perhaps started to get a little ridiculous. As such, this sequel to WRC 10 has ditched the numbering system, and goes by the more approachable title of WRC Generations. It’s an interesting time to finally make the change, however, because this is the last game in the WRC series as it stands before EA and Codemasters take over the wheel from KT Racing.
The WRC games have something of a reputation on Switch for not quite delivering optimal performance, and for the most part that’s the case here too. Generations looks ever so slightly better than WRC 10, but that doesn’t mean we’re now looking at Forza or anything like that.

The thing is, though, when it comes to GOTY lists like our Advent Calendar, it’s a much bigger task to convince your fellow voters of the merits of your new favourite game when it’s the third, fourth, or maybe even sixteenth in its series. I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.

When Nintendo and Game Freak announced that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet would feature the franchise's first fully open world, fans understandably had many questions: just how open are we talking? See that mountain? Can I go to it?
The finished article undoubtedly delivered on Nintendo's promise, even if it demonstrated a few rough edges in the process. The world of Paldea was truly your oyster, and for the first time in Pokémon's 25 year history, you could go wherever you wanted right from the start, skill level be damned.

Over the holidays we're republishing some choice features from the last 12 months. A mix of talking points, interviews, opinion pieces and more from NL staff and contributors, you'll find our usual blend of thoughtfulness, expertise, frivolity, retro nostalgia, and — of course — enthusiasm for all things Nintendo. Happy holidays!

If you're into anime, then chances are you can remember the first movie or TV show that got you hooked on the medium; your "gateway drug", if you will. For some, it might be TV shows like DragonBall Z or One Piece, others perhaps a specific movie like Ghost in the Shell or Akira (indeed, I had to really go back through the memory archives to determine whether Akira was the first one for me; it was definitely incredibly early in my life). For me, however, the very earliest memory I have of watching anime was the incredible video game adaptation, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, released in 1994.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get Very Metal this winter
Epic Games Store is continuing its rollout of free video games for each and every day of the holidays, today's offering — still available for a few more hours — is dark action RPG Mortal Shell, which all users can download direct from the EGS dashboard.
Developed by Cold Symmetry and launched on PC and console platforms in 2020, Mortal Shell is fantasy adventure that takes extreme pride in its highly challenging, melee-focused combat. Inspired by the much-loved Dark Souls franchise, the development team set out to make a similarly toned adventure where every single swing of the blade mattered, where life and death rest on the edge of one right (or wrong) decision in the heat of battle, and where swift adaptation to each enemy is the key to victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSs0_PBGiLs&ab_channel=PlayStation
In Mortal Shell, players can inhabit the bodies (or "mortal shells") of the deceased, gaining access to their skills, weapons, and abilities. As such, the combat in the game has a natural evolution, as the player passes from body to body, learning new skills on the fly and adapting to the reconfiguration of their offensive and defensive maneuvers. Mortal Shell received plaudits on release for its smart combat and compelling challenge, with many noting that its unabashed love of the FromSoftware titles was readily apparent, with some reviewers noting that it felt like playing Dark Souls for the first time all over again.
Mortal Shell is available to download for free from Epic Games Store. It is also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

NieR fans won't have to wait too long into the new year for its anime adaptation to kick off. The NieR: Automata anime has locked in a premiere date for January 7, 2023 in Japan.
A few trailers have been dropping over the holidays for the upcoming anime adaptation of 2017's NieR: Automata. The first features 2B and 9S fairly prominently, as two leads we'll be following in the Ver. 1.1a anime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGpskkA7vrw
Another new trailer today shows off some of the supporting cast, as well as the opening and ending tracks for the series. Both trailers have a January 7 premiere date set for the adaptation. We already knew it was arriving sometime in January, but it looks like the date is much sooner in the month than one might have expected.
Most of the adaptation is covering some familiar territory, given what we see in the trailers. There is one character, Lily, who appears in the lore but seems to be playing a larger role in the anime. It'll be interesting to see how much this Ver 1.1a diverges from the game.
Become as gods
The series looks set to air on Crunchyroll as well as other platforms, though exact distribution plans and dates aren't clear just yet. We'll have to see just what the global rollout looks like as the series goes live.
NieR: Automata isn't the only video game adaptation kicking off in January 2023, either. HBO's The Last of Us is set to debut not too long after on January 15, 2023. And the animated Dragon Age: Absolution just recently went live on Netflix, too. It's quite the time for video game adaptations, and there's even more on the way. Hopefully they can turn out as well as shows like Arcane and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have.

The new year is almost upon us, and with it a new month of PlayStation Plus titles. Sony has revealed the three games headed to PlayStation Plus to kick off January 2023, including a good way to brush up ahead of a big 2023 release.
Headlining the January 2023 PS Plus offering is Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the single-player action-adventure game from Respawn following runaway Jedi Cal Kestis. It's a good grab for anyone who needs to catch up on the story, as its sequel Jedi: Survivor is due to arrive in March. It's not a large window, but Fallen Order should be easy to blast through in that amount of time.
For a little more multiplayer, Fallout 76 heads onto PS4. Though there's been an ongoing tussle over the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard acquisition, Bethesda's multiplayer Fallout will be free to grab for PlayStation Plus users in the month of January 2023.
Closing out the month is Axiom Verge 2, the follow-up to the first Axiom Verge. While it takes a more action-platforming approach with fewer guns and more exploration, it's still a solid experience worth checking out if you enjoy exploring a map and ticking off squares.

While those three games head to every category under PlayStation's tiered Plus system, more is on the way for those at the higher tiers. The PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium lineup for January is set to be announced soon.
These PlayStation Plus games, meanwhile, go live on January 3, 2023. And if you haven't yet, there's still time to add Mass Effect: Legendary Edition and the other December PlayStation Plus games to your library before they go away.

The horizons of my video game tastes have broadened pretty significantly over the past few years, but my undying love for narrative games first and foremost has never wavered. While 2022 has been a great year for games in general, from heavy hitters like Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok to indie darlings like Cult of the Lamb and Vampire Survivors, I think this past year has been one of the best we've seen for narrative games in a good while due to the breadth of stories that were told both thematically and mechanically.
Whether those stories were rooted in lighthearted, optimistic sentimentality or a grounded, gritty introspection, I was reminded time and time again why I'm so excited for games to continue paving the way forward as our youngest and most dyna…]]></summary>

I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn't get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

Veteran publisher Taito, in conjunction with developer M2, has released a teaser trailer for its upcoming shmup compilation Ray'z Arcade Chronology. The classic shmup series take to the stars once again when it launches in Japan on PS4 and Nintendo Switch in March 2023.
As we have previously reported, Ray’z Arcade Chronology compiles the three original titles from the franchise — namely RayForce (1994), RayStorm (1996) and RayCrisis (1998) — with a newly revamped edition of the 2013 remaster RayStorm HD, complete with brand new features including a classic 4:3 screen ratio and the original arcade dipswitch settings. The compendium is then rounded out with a brand new remaster of RayCrisis, titled RayCrisis HD, specifically developed for this new release.
Ray’z Arcade Chronology will launch in Japan March 9, 2023, on PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Western fans of the pew-pew persuasion need not fret, as publisher ININ Games has already confirmed that it will be localizing the collection for western release, although a specific launch date is yet to be announced.

I love dark winter nights. If it's below freezing with snow piled on the window sills and wind whipping through frozen tree branches, then even better. I definitely don't want to be out in those conditions, but late December evenings are the perfect backdrop to some of my favorite winter traditions. I've abandoned a lot of those tinsel-covered activities and replaced them with things that I like more.
While my list continues to grow, it currently includes playing Nick Offerman's "Yule Log", gifting new clothes to loved ones to protect them from the Yule Cat, and reading ghost stories on Christmas Eve. I've adopted these things over the years from my hobbies and from the stories people tell me. Now they bring me joy when I need joy the most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...]]></summary>

The Guilty Gear franchise is renowned for its bizarre arsenal of stylish weaponry, from Faust's 10-foot scalpel to Ino's satanic shredder, but perhaps one of the most ingenious tools belongs to the delightful young bounty hunter Bridget, in the form of her trick-shot-tastic Bullet Yo-Yo.
And, if you fancy taking an eye or two out yourself, then hobby crafter SpinGear has you covered, as the Japanese yo-yo specialist is now taking pre-orders on an exceptionally cool-looking replica of Bridget's weapon of choice. The "Full Metal Bridget Mini Yo-Yo" is an authentic (if smaller) replica of our girl's face-flicker, faithfully recreating the six-shooter style of its casing and cast in solid metal.
Check out the ace toy/death dealer in action in this official video, complete with Bridget cosplay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3ql62Lot7E
So if you fancy picking one up, hurting yourself, and realizing you're just as terrible with the yo-yo now as you were with that Coca-Cola one in 1991, then head on over to the official YOYOSHOP SPINGEAR website, where you can pre-order the Full Metal Bridget Yo-Yo for ¥44,000 or... erm... $330 USD... Well, if that seems a little on the pricey side for you, then a far simpler design is also expected in January, priced at a somewhat cheaper ¥4,400, or $32.
"We understand pre-order expensive yoyo feels little scary." explains the website. Yer-darn-tootin'. But, hey, you can't put a price on knocking mum's favorite vase off the mantle.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port arrives spring 2023.
Oh, and don't forget to check out our previous report on this cute Bridget fan animation.

It wasn't an easy task, to be honest. Sure, this year saw the delay of multiple big-name projects into 2023. I'm a bit grateful for that though, as it at least gave me time to spend on some smaller indie releases. And wow, did they come out swinging.
This year was the year of small games, tactics games, story-driven and narrative titles, and more. I played a lot of games this year that felt like they were pushing forward, whether through new mechanics and ideas or just pushing hardware to its limits. Sitt…]]></summary>

Elden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just in time for the new year, Sony has revealed the next batch of free games coming to PlayStation Plus. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 will be available to download for all tiers of PS Plus starting Tuesday, January 3. PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they'll be "announced soon." You can read the full blog post here.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.
This is also a friendly reminder to claim December's PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. They'll all be available until January 3, the day the new games are added, so be sure to grab them before that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Case proceeding against Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator
Former Sega veteran Yuji Naka has been formally indicted following their arrest earlier this month for suspected insider trading. The indictment was reported yesterday by Japan's NHK news corporation.
Naka was first arrested in November as part of an investigation into insider trading at studio Square Enix, led by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors’ Office Investigation Department. Naka, along with two further SE employees named as Taisuke Sazaki and Fumiaki Suzuki, was arrested under suspicion of purchasing stock in Japanese studio Aiming, right before Square announced that the developer was working on a new title in the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quest: Tact.
At the start of December, Naka was re-arrested after the investigation uncovered further evidence suggesting that the Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator had purchased 120,000 shares in developer ATeam ahead of the announcement that said studio would be producing mobile release Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. The shares in question were valued at around ¥144.7 million yen ($834,000 USD).
"We have been fully cooperating with requests from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission," said Square Enix in a statement published in November. “As the investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is underway, we will continue to fully cooperate with their investigation."
"We deeply regret the great concern this has caused to all concerned. We have dealt with this incident strictly, including internal disciplinary actions taken against the suspected employees."
It is currently not known when or if Naka will stand trial for these charges. Yuji Naka left Square Enix in 2021, following the critical and commercial failure Balan Wonderworld. Naka would later file suit against Square Enix, arguing that they had removed him from development six months ahead of release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking back over an entire year of RPS reviews and, well, we've written a lot. Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.
Out of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 22, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!

As the year's end shuffles into view, number-crunching firms are taking a look back at the last 12 months to recognize patterns, facts, and figures as they pertain to gaming, retail, prices, sales, and player behavior — And a new report from the statisticians at NewZoo offers up some interesting reading.
NewZoo places its estimate for the global games market value at a staggering $184.4 billion USD. This accounts for almost game sales, on PC, console, and mobile platforms. It should also be noted that this already impressive figure does not take into account Nintendo game sales, as the publisher has always been weirdly prudish when it comes to revealing its own bottom line.

Of this total market value, $51.8 billion manifested through console games, with a further $38.2 billion pulled in by downloaded/boxed PC titles, and $2.3 billion from browser-based PC games. Of course, mobile gaming takes the lion's share, with a massive $92.2 billion in total revenue. This sector was led by the continued dominance of titles such as TiMi Studios' Honor of Kings, and PUBG Corporation's PUBG Mobile, which continue to earn billions year-on-year from the global market.
When it comes specifically to console gaming, around 72% of all game sales were digital downloads, with only the remained 28% accounting for physical releases. This continues a trend we have witnessed for many years now, with each consecutive year seeing more and more customers opting for digital game purchases over boxed copies. Again, this figure does not include Nintendo Switch software, which represents perhaps the last real bastion of high-street retail gaming purchases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zuh?
The jury is out on pretty much every detail regarding Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but we might have another piece of the puzzle if this ad is legit. Reddit user Few_Working3350 has apparently located an ad, which showcases some form of Nintendo Switch Online functionality for the game.
The ad seems to be Dutch in origin, with the standard marketing phrase "Haal meer uit je Nintendo Switch," which roughly translates to "get more out of your Nintendo Switch!" The ad then highlights some form of Switch Online functionality, with a big banner. If true, it could be anything; possibly even some form of asynchronous mechanic similar to the Souls series. It could also be an erroneous local ad that explains that you can connect online and download future DLC. We've reached out to Nintendo for clarification on the matter.

We're still half a year away from Tears of the Kingdom
The next big entry in the Zelda franchise is due out on May 13, 2023, and you can bet we'll be seeing some showcases for it: maybe as early as this January.
Nintendo has a lot of confidence going into this release given all the good will they've generated from Breath of the Wild, so this seems like it'll be a pretty easy slam dunk. I mean, if they rework weapon durability and add real dungeons, this game will potentially soar even higher.

Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...]]></summary>

At their best, these videos turn a good joke into a complete comedy sketch. And the person making them at their best is Gloomhonk.

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s road to acquire Activision Blizzard has been a rocky one, to say the least. The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. 
The full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of Cuphead is indie gaming legend. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.
With Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing.

I joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites! It's even harder to celebrate my own achievements, but that's beside the point.

I’d probably also tip a hat to Warhammer 40K: Darktide, but Alice0 already nabbed it for her honourable mentions, and frankly there’s enough shootybang stuff here as it is. But, also: toilet build quality testing, pushing Nazis into cement pits, and more than a hint of 70s funk. Check ‘em out.

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, it’s become harder and harder for me to make the kinds of in-depth, year-end personal best lists that I once prided myself on. That newfound difficulty is for one reason: I’m not playing as many games. This year, there are so many games I either didn’t play at all or didn’t spend enough time with that…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though it’s a remake of a game released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us Part I is, in most respects, the same game as the original The Last of Us. Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.
But even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right. By making a game look “better” than it did before, it’s changed into something else. Whether in small or large ways, it is altered. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nier: Automata is coming to the small screen. Beginning next month, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in the United States on Crunchyroll.
You can check out a brand-new trailer for the show below: 


From the looks of it, Ver1.1a will stick close to the storyline from the video game, released in 2017 as a partnership between publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games. Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. 
The series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023. As of right now, it's not entirely clear what day it will hit Crunchyroll. However, the streaming service does often have the right to begin showing anime in the west within 24 hours of their original airtimes, so time will tell if Nier gets the same treatment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, "Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like "Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).
Because we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!

Today, the best price we've spotted for the RX 6700 XT is for a Gigabyte Eagle model, selling on Amazon UK for £389.99. That's nearly 40% below its RRP and an overall great value for this level of performance.

Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? 
I traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that's been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer. 
Simply put, Los Angeles has become an island, metaphorically speaking.

His will be different, he says, because he's "taking the approach of changing and evolving the world of Death Stranding in a way that suits film well".
He also says there's "no real need" to turn games into films, which is a true and enjoyable acknowledgement from someone who is doing that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports Story is available now, Nintendo and developer SideBar Games announced during a special Inside the House of Indies holiday video. The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.
Golf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. 
You can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.


Golf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it "a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics," awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.
Sports Story is available now for Switch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gran Turismo series has long been a favorite of sim-racing enthusiasts, and today marks a special milestone for the franchise. Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator was released on PlayStation in Japan on December 23, 1997, meaning that the series has officially crossed the quarter-century mark. To celebrate 25 years of Gran Turismo, PlayStation released a special blog post and a retrospective video.
The blog post comes by way of Kazunori Yamauchi, creator and producer of the franchise and CEO of Polyphony Digital. In the post, Yamauchi recounts how the series came to be, with his original plans for the series stretching as far back as 1992.
"I was fascinated by real time 3D graphics that many had been waiting for, and created and presented plans for all kinds of video games, not ju…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a playable teaser released to promote Life Is Strange 2, the first episode of which followed on three months after this surprise p.t. dropped during E3 2018. Not to be confused with Silent Hills P.T. (it's like… the exact opposite of that), Captain Spirit is free to play, takes two to three hours to complete, and manages to perfectly encapsulate the Life Is Strange experience without giving anything away about the main (read: paid-for) games in the series. It also features possibly my favourite LIS protagonist in adorable wannabe superhero Chris, which is quite a high bar to clear, considering how much time I spend banging on about what great characters Chloe and Sean are.

Brothers Tarn and Zach Adams have spent the past 16 years relying on donations, so actually selling their game has now allowed to expand their team and hire someone from their community to help with the programming. They say "Putnam" will be the first non-Adam to ever see the code behind the curtain. Cue the Indiana Jones face-melting gif.
An update yesterday also added Steam trading cards, as well as giving you the option to flick between classic and premium graphics.

It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don't particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin'?
This gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I've had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I'm live and uncensored, baby. I'm going to fire up Among Trees. Let's go and be alone together. But don't worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I'll make sure the final word is a joke.

I have not done the maths, but I've seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don't try our hardest all the same. 
Inevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, "I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point. Maybe January...? Please don't hate me)

If the goal is to repeat a course 20 times to trim 0.2 seconds off a number, and not to cackle like a petty chaos gremlin as you slam someone off the track at a tight corner, I am probably not going to enjoy myself much.
Rush Rally 3 isn't all that serious, but it's still on the wrong side of the tracks for me, I thought, before accidentally playing it for 3 hours. This is an excellent bundle of rally trials, challenges, and simple circuit racing with a cheerfully mid-2000s feel. I might prefer the messy nonsense of Trail Out, but if you value actual driving skill more highly, this is well worth your time.

But also it was December the 16th, so I saw fit to waste his time asking a bunch of fun seasonal questions that blended the love and goodwill of Baldur's Gate 3, with the companion-wrangling and clutch strategy of Christmas. D'you see what I did there?
My questions are in bold, and Vincke's answers are undeneath - and they are both amusing and instructive. I for one hope that Wyll's romcom visit home becomes a future winter DLC.

Perhaps it's because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I'm likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you're giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I'll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.


First though, it's time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol' shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I'd probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games are bringing a custom arcade mode, new filters, and more to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. 
This news comes by way of a Steam blog post for the game that reveals this new update is available to download right now. It includes a new custom arcade mode, CRT and VCR filters, and additional fixes and changes to the game. 


"The update implements Custom Game options, granting ninjas greater control over their tubular battle against the Foot Clan through 11 mix-and-match modifiers reminiscent of the dip switches found on old school arcade machines," a press release reads. "Retro-themed filters and an extra large serving of refinements round out the surprise update, which reaches PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox players today." 
Here is a look at the Custom Game options dip switch board: 
As you can see, it looks like there's plenty to mix and match to make each custom arcade session feel unique. If you're interested, be sure to boot the game up today and get the update downloading. 
For more, read Game Informer's TMNT: Shredder's Revenge review. You can also read how TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection got a patch yesterday that adds online play to the SNES version of Turtles in Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Santa Monica Studio has announced that God of War Ragnarök, which hit PlayStation consoles last month, is getting a New Game Plus mode in spring. 
This news comes by way of a short and sweet tweet posted today by the studio that says Spring 2023 is when fans can expect the feature to hit Ragnarök. As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll "share more details once we get closer to the release." 


While many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game's director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era.

Alt254 is a minimalist action adventure game that plays out on a small (albeit greatly enlarged) map that measures just 21x26 pixels.

It's a very enigmatic little game, but one that's instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair


In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I used my amazing arithmetical reasoning abilities to surmise that there were only eight free games left to come from the Epic Games Store’s Winter Sale giveaway. I was wrong. Don’t look shocked, it happens. Today sees three of the earliest Fallout games being offered up for nothing. They’re Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood Of Steel. I already own all three elsewhere, as you might well too, but if you don’t then it’s a good way of picking up three classics of 90s PC gaming.

Well, Ubisoft and Capcom have teamed up to make the lives of digital peasants even harder, by shoving some Monster Hunter World themed gubbins into Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla. Have a watch of the trailer below to see just how bizarre this crossover is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tradition is a transformative power. Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event's core, and that doesn't matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.

You can expect some extra stability compared to the previous version of the update, something that’ll always be welcome on my PC. Along with Roach’s early Christmas present of some stabilisers, the hotfix also tackles the annoying bug that caused toxicity to be stuck at max level, along with some minor tweaks to photo mode, and unexplained improvements for The Witcher 3’s performance on Steam Deck.

But given the game's subject centres on the depiction of women on film, and their exploitation in the film industry by male creators, it felt appropriate to examine it from the extremely talented femme members of the team. That means not just the star Marissa Marcel herself, played by the award-winning Manon Gage, but other women and non-binary creatives who played different roles in bringing this game to life.

Admittedly, that’s in spite of some shortcomings, including utterly broken performance on even the strongest Radeon RX graphics cards. Equip yourself with RTX hardware, however, and this free mod is a real Christmas treat.

New, temporarily common locations are a clever way of mixing things up, imposing restraints or possibilities depending on how much you tinker with your decks. 
The latest location, Vormir, is a bit borked. I just spent a minute or so swapping emotes with someone while the game tried to load our (unrelated) animations, which might not sound like much but constitutes a good third of a match's normal running time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that's a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it's oh so satisfying.
We've written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.

Overwatch 2’s marking the occasion by turning robotic damage hero Bastion into a gingerbread automaton with a new legendary skin. Seeing as it’s the holidays, Blizzard are charging just a single Overwatch Coin for the skin, which is way, way less than the thousands that legendaries usually cost. Bastion’s fresh look is also quite a bit more involved than some of the other legendary efforts Blizzard’s dreamt up for Overwatch 2 so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven't played enough to give you a big wot I think. It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.
Yaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.

For now, the keycards needed to enter Building 21 are disabled. It seems like these keycards may have been the reason for the lockdown, although Infinity Ward have yet to explain just why Building 21 is shutting its doors temporarily. The lockdown was announced in a tweet, which only cryptically referred to the cause.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2013’s Risk of Rain is getting an enhanced remake, and it’s coming next year to celebrate its 10th birthday. Titled Risk of Rain Returns, it spruces up the original with improved art, new survivors, and more.
Announced during Nintendo’s House of Indies: Holiday Event Day 2 today, Risk of Rain Returns expands upon the first game while applying the lessons and improvements of Risk of Rain 2. Although Returns does not adopt the sequel's 3D art direction, it features new HD pixel art, balancing tweaks, and new music tracks from composer Chris Christodoulou. It also has improved multiplayer, with other content updates to be shared in the future. Check out the animated announcement trailer below. 


In a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox. 
Risk of Rain Returns will be available on Switch and PC. To learn more, check out our review for the original Risk of Rain here. Be sure to also visit our evolving list of upcoming video game remakes.]]></summary>

Overcoming these missions unlocks new modifiers that introduce alternative combat moves, cheats, and outfits. Arenas also arrives in March and serves as the latest addition in a roadmap of seasonal post-launch updates that have bolstered the title with more cosmetics, cheats, difficulty settings, and even a replay editor.

As well as that, BG3 got its ninth update, the last significant one before release, which raises the level cap to 5 and adds Paladin as a playable class. I caught up with Larian's founder and director Swen Vincke (this time sans full suit of armour) and he told me that, despite Update 9 being a big one, there's still a lot to come.

Yes, even more so than Half-Life 2. Maybe it’s the slower flying speed of the desk, giving you more time to anticipate the blow. Maybe it’s the recoil of the face. Or maybe it’s just how the desk, or whichever piece of office fixture you’re telekinetically hurling, impacts in a hilarious explosion of shards and scraps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, yes, I know this is our fourth post on the subject but it’s mostly good news – The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update is now considerably less of a technical muddle. After applying yesterday’s PC hotfix, performance with the new ray tracing settings is majorly improved, and if you don’t (or can’t) use those, The Witcher 3 no longer runs slower than it did before the next-gen update hobbled it. 


That’s judging by some tests I’ve run using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, on which overall stability seems to have improved as well. I’m still having trouble with AMD graphics cards, however, with FSR upscaling being a particularly reliable source of crashes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Do not be afraid to die." That's the advice of Haemimont Games' CEO Bisser Dyankov when it comes to playing their new open world survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn. Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you're at it. 
The world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded's initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I've settled on a couple of vital dos and don'ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don't: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it's going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to "challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge," Dyankov tells me. "Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it's a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable." I'll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors' legs off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix announced its Final Fantasy pixel remasters of the series' first six games in June of last year, and over the course of roughly eight months, each of those remasters hit PC platforms. Fans have been waiting since that announcement for the reveal of console versions of these remasters and finally, Square Enix has revealed that all six are coming to PlayStation and Switch next year. 
More specifically, these pixel remasters will hit PlayStation 4 and Switch sometime in the spring of 2023. Each of these games can be purchased individually or together as a bundle, and a limited physical edition will also be available on the same day. Here's a look at what to expect in the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster: FF 35th Anniversary Edition: 
Final Fantasy I-VI Collection - physical collection of all games for either PS4 or Nintendo Switch
Anniversary Edition goods box
A bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package
2-disc vinyl record set featuring newly arranged game music with exclusive cover artwork by Kazuko Shibuya
A specially compiled artbook showcasing beautiful character pixel art 
Eight stylized pixel art character figures in window packaging
This edition of the game is available exclusively on the Square Enix Store and its first batch is already sold out (although you can join a waiting list here)
The company says a "small run of physical standard editions [of the collection] will also be available exclusively from the Square Enix Store from Spring 2023," but notes that quantities will be "extremely limited" so if you're interested, you should preorder. 
For more information about each of these pixel remasters, head to Square Enix's blog post. Check out our ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game to find out where Final Fantasy I-VI land on our list after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has revealed that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


"What a year it's been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we've been in absolute awe of the work of our peers," Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. "Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here's to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall." 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, "Following the events of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel's Spider-Man series." 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales. 
Do you think Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will hit PS5 next fall or do you think it will be delayed beyond that? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.
