Simulators are a huge part of the gaming industry, and they've especially been seeing some love for the past few years after the success of games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Stardew Valley. This year it seems like there are more sims than ever, and simulators are one of my all-time favorite gaming genres, so I'm over the moon about it. Out of all the trailers for simulators we've seen this year, one that caught my eye was Spirittea, which is being developed by Cheesemaster Games and published by No More Robots. The logline is that it's Stardew meets Spirited Away, which was automatically enough to get me on board. I played the demo, and so far, things look pretty promising.

What's Spirittea's premise?

Xbox has "reimagined" a pair of classic Xbox 360 Gamerpics for the modern era, and I was not prepared for all the memories these images would kick up. The team dropped a set of new avatars this week, and two of them — a bubble-gum punk with a beanie and a happy panda — should look familiar. Their roots go back to the early days of Gamerpics.

At the risk of strolling too far down memory lane and collapsing into a pile of dust, it's fun to think back on the original Xbox 360 Gamerpics — which profile pic did you use?
If you aren't a digital avatar hoarder (or if it's simply been way too long), here's a refresher.

The horde survival genre, I guess you'd call it, has had quite the year so far. Vampire Survivors lit the world on fire, and of course, there have been imitators. But what sets 20 Minutes Till Dawn apart from the crowd isn't just its similarities to Survivors, but its key changes that make quite a difference.
I checked out the demo version, cleverly titled 10 Minutes Till Dawn, earlier this year and came away impressed. Well, after a decent number of runs in 20 Minutes Till Dawn's Early Access launch, that enthusiasm hasn't gone away. Developer flanne's roguelike survival still has room to grow, but its core concept is pretty darn solid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, no more guesswork
My entire gaming life, I've had some pretty crappy computers. At one point, I was playing endless amounts of Stardew Valley on an old Lenovo ThinkPad that I used in college, but it didn't really matter because that game could run on a toaster. I once tried to play BioShock Infinite on that same laptop... that one didn't go so well. I've upgraded a bit since then, but it's still a gamble whether or not a game I bought on my PC is going to run on my secondhand gaming laptop. Well now the Xbox App on PC has put out a new feature that could save our skins from downloading games we can't even play — that's right, it can tell you whether or not your computer will be able to run a game before you download it.
The way it works is really simple: you select the game you want to potentially download, and right under the install button, you get a message that says whether or not your PC can handle it.
In a blog post for the June updates for Xbox PC app, an example photo of the feature says of Sea of Thieves, "Plays well on similar PCs." That's way simpler than having to look through your computer specs, compare them against the game's recommended hardware, and pray. This feature will be especially useful for Xbox Game Pass holders, who of course download games from the Xbox App quite often.

Xbox highlights other improvements that they made to the app in that same blog post, including updates to the backend so that everything "will run smoother and with more reliability." They also claim to have made improvements to the app's navigation and search features, but most of that sounds like adding search categories like "Game to play together" and "Side scrollers."

        <updated>2022-06-17T20:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.
Murph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.
Below are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. 

In a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: 
“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”
If you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.
Where on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's where to watch them
In case you missed it, The Pokemon Company has been producing a series of Poketoons: cartoons that are generally centered around a specific creature per episode, and showcase side stories not related to the "trainer" or mainline mythos. They've been available in Japan for some time now, gradually rolling out since 2020, but now they're coming westward.
So this western rollout is a two-tiered release system: here's how it'll shake out!

You can watch the first western release Poketoon now on Pokemon TV
The first Poketoon is live now on Pokemon TV, and each week, we'll get one more (for eight weeks, until the entire season is complete). As a reminder, Pokemon TV can be accessed via a browser, as well as through a mobile or Switch app.
You may recall that the first episode, "Chase the Beans," came out in 2020. This is referred to as "Scraggy and Mimikyu" for the official western release. If the calendar is the same as the Japanese rollout, we'll get the more emotional Pancham episode next.

They'll also come to YouTube in the west later this year
Expect this Pokemon TV exclusivity to last a while. This is what The Pokemon Company had to say about Poketoons rolling out to platforms other than Pokemon TV :
"The series will appear on the official Pokémon YouTube Channel later this fall."


Or, you can watch them now in Japanese on YouTube
Or, if you're OK with Japanese-language episodes, you can just watch them all right now, unfettered, via YouTube.
The link to the entire playlist of all eight episodes is here. Note that the first episode, Chase and Beans, has no real spoken dialogue; so it's universal in any language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. 
The Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. 
Fans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. 
Another Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development.

The sun is shining, the weekend is just around the corner, and Good Smile Company has opened pre-orders on this ridiculously adorable Nendoroid of Guilty Gear's mysterious, straight-faced apocalypse lover, Ramlethal Valentine.
Like so many of her compadres in the mammoth Nendoroid range, (though only the second pulled from Arc System Works' anime fight franchise), Ramlethal stands a dinky four inches in height, (and most of that is her big ol' hat), and is authentically bedecked in her bladed coat and hot pants combo. Packaged with Ramlethal are Lucifero and her semi-sentient greatswords, an alternate set of arms, and an alternate face plate — so you can have grumpy or grump-and-shouting. Clear stands allow Ramlethal and her swords to defy gravity, giving the impression that they are floating in place. Nice touch.

So, if you want a teeny world-eater of your very own, then the Ramlethal Valentine Nendoroid is available to pre-order now over at the Good Smile Co. online store. Ramlethal retails for ¥9,500 (roughly $70 USD), not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Ramlethal is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2023. And if you want here to have a pal, then be sure to check out the Dizzy Nendo as well.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC.

There's a new Pixar movie! But it's pretending to be a very old Pixar movie! Lightyear is a sort of Toy Story prequel, you see — it's the "real life" movie that Buzz Lightyear would be based off. So, even though it's a 2022 movie, it's pretending to be a space movie from the '70s or '80s, right? Yeah.
Anyway! As part of the movie's launch, it's coming to Minecraft, which is a real game that is modern and not from the 20th century.

The news revealed yesterday confirms that the next entry arrives next winter, and the story of Cloud and pals will continue on. But Rebirth also locks in a few interesting tidbits about Final Fantasy VII Remake itself, which seem to cement the direction being taken with remaking this classic adventure: truly re-making it.
[This article contains spoilers for Final Fantasy VII Remake.]
There was a curiosity, I think, about what the naming convention of this new series would be after the first was simply called Final Fantasy VII Remake. Is the next one “Remake Part 2?” Final Fantasy VII Remake Continued? Or some other equally bizarre naming convention, the kind only Square could concoct?
Well, the answer is much more …]]></summary>

Every Xenoblade Chronicles 3 party member reveal has been fantastic, and that includes this new one that showcases Juniper.
You can watch her slide in with "extreme" energy and use her beam bow in the below video:
https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1536969465090707456
And this US tweet gives us a bit more background on the character:
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1537532975222489098
The "forest archer" trope is a tried and true idea, but she really rounds out the cast so far, which has been predominantly melee-focused. An agile stealth-based character sounds like a fun way to mix up your party, and I think alongside of Zeon, I have two front-runners.
That "final party cut" dilemma is a huge part of JRPGs, and I haven't even played one iota of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and I'm really feeling it. Thankfully you can have a huge party in this game.
There's a lot of nuance to some of the systems in the third entry, and I can't wait to get my hands on it and dig in. Hopefully the story will deliver, especially in terms of the pacing. It's one of the biggest things a Xenoblade Chronicles game can struggle with for a lot of people, and there's potential to assuage that fear here.

We're just having a little bit of fun here, but, strangely, the last thing we heard about Pikmin 4 was in an interview with Eurogamer in 2017. Yep, that's right!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mighty Metroidvania returns
It's been a bit of a wait, but soon Switch fans will be able to get their furry mitts on of 2021's most undersung releases. Publisher Astrolabe Games announced that dystopian Metroidvania F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch will finally arrive on Nintendo Switch on July 12, priced at $29.99. (Pre-order customers will receive a 10% discount on the price.)
I probably don't need to pour over this title once again to all y'all, especially those who have followed my coverage to date, but F.I.S.T. is a tough, creative, and surprisingly hi-tech adventure that sees a forgotten war hero forced to take up arms (literally) in order to save his friend from the sinister and oppressive regime that presides over the city and its downtrodden populace. Combining finely-detailed locations and animation, solid voice-acting, and a very deep combat system, F.I.S.T. was one of last year's slickest and most engaging adventures.
https://twitter.com/FISTthegame/status/1537430040031334401?s=20&t=apmaU3Y5J0BOYN4M5wJuAA
Despite its pulled-back camera and deceptive looks, TiGames' adventure is actually a pretty resource-heavy release, packed out with impressive special effects, fantastically "live" locations, and hectic, screen-filling boss battles. It will be interesting to see how it ports to the Nintendo Switch hardware and whether it leaves its humble processor sweating carrots. The publisher says that the Switch edition is aiming for 30 FPS at 1080p resolution docked, and 30FPS at 720p in handheld mode.
F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch launches on Nintendo Switch July 12. It is available right now on PlayStation and PC platforms. Microids will release a physical edition on PlayStation and Switch in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, we got a Smash Ultimate DLC out of it
Welp. ARMS is officially five years old as of June 16, 2022, and sadly, it's kind of been forgotten outside of a few references here and there. But you know what? I'm going to briefly talk about it and bring it back into the collective consciousness, even for one day.
I remember the very first time I played ARMS: it was in a warehouse for a Nintendo press tour, right before it was set to release. I felt the same about it as I did at the time of my review, and how I feel now: it's fun, but it never really reaches its full potential. I would have loved to have played it more, but my local scene was pretty rough, as a lot of folks didn't take to it; or understandably want to take the plunge for $60 (note: this game is still $60 digitally).
I'm a sucker for these types of arena fighters too! Anything where you can load up four players and go crazy, I'm there. I even played hours of The Bouncer multiplayer! At one point in time I'm pretty sure that was considered a felony.
Five years on, arguably, the biggest impact the ARMS IP made was as a DLC fighter (Min Min) in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate two years ago. Other than that, outside of a few sticker/logo references, it's faded into a distant memory.
But you know what? The memory of ARMS might be faded, but it's not lost...yet. It's still on Switch: a platform that's still going strong and fully supported. And if you own it: maybe boot up one more battle, for old spring's sake.

Street Fighter has always had a close relationship with its own dulcet tones, with each iteration in the classic fight franchise sporting a host of great, (and very occasionally not-so-great), tunes — Street Fighter 6 is looking to truly embrace these themes, with a street-grown hip-hop atmosphere to match its alleyway visuals and nightclub fashion wardrobe.
Yesterday, Capcom released full versions of three SF6 character themes, sounding the siren for the arrival of three of the sequel's currently confirmed characters. Sitting in the jukebox today are shoto master Ryu, crimestopper Chun-Li, and braggadocious military brat Luke. So crank up the volume, sonny, and let's check 'em out.
Luke - "Taking Aim"

As great as the Street Fighter series is, pugilism fans with longer memories will tell you that it’s about ruddy time some of Capcom’s somewhat lesser-known games are getting their time in the spotlight. Arriving on Switch on 24th June, Capcom Fighting Collection showcases not just the entire Darkstalkers series, but also a succession of obscurities, including one game that’s getting its first home release ever — the spectacular Red Earth.
Given the vintage of these punch-’em-ups, we thought it prudent to offer something of a cheat sheet on the included titles, so that when you get cornered by a fan of the genre at the pub or something, you can hold your own in conversation without fear of ridicule or reprimand.

Instead, we had the third annual Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest and a handful of connected and not-so-connected streams and events from other gaming media outlets and publishers. While we had a full weekend of games on display and more than enough to cover, there's something about the current setup for the game industry's biggest info dump of the year that's leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.
What I'd like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it. All the better if these events could coalesce in one general location. We used to have a good seven days or so of events, press conferences…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mean, get it if you don't have it
Celeste quickly became one of the most relevant platformers in the past five years or so, and if you haven't partaken yet, now is the time. Both Celeste and TowerFall are on sale for five bucks on the Switch eShop.
The news comes via Extremely OK Games (the creators behind both titles), and the interesting part of the announcement is that in addition to North America, it's also on sale in Europe: including parts of Europe it's never been on sale before in the past.
While TowerFall is easily better with local players behind it, Celeste is a must-buy in any context. Seriously, if you even remotely enjoy platformers, just get it for that price. It'll last you through the weekend and then some, and odds are you'll be thinking about it long after that. And even if you don't normally like platformers or struggle with them, it has some extra options to tweak to make things a little more manageable.
You can find Celeste here on Switch, and TowerFall on sale here. The Switch is a great platform for both! Portability suits Celeste as it has echoes of a Game Boy title, and TowerFall, with its party atmosphere, makes sense for a Nintendo console.

I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan. Still, this “unparalleled ambition” worries me. 
Sunday’s gameplay footage ended with what Bethesda likely thought was a big bang (pun intended). Players can land anywhere on any planet in any solar system of their choice or, as Howard excitedly put it, “Over 100 systems. Over 1,000 planets. All open for you to explore.” On cue, the camera zoomed out, revealing countless nodes on an overwhelmingly extensiv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sale runs until June 23
Dragon's Dogma is on sale right now, in part to celebrate the announcement of the sequel late last night in an errant Capcom stream.
So the general gist of the sale is a roughly 84% off discount on every platform but Switch, where it's 66% off. Here's the breakdown, with links:
PC/Steam - $4.79 - PC/GOG - $5.09 - Humble Bundle
Xbox (playable on Xbox One/Series X and S) - $4.49
PSN (playable on PS4 and PS5) - $4.79
Switch - $9.99
For under five bucks, Dragon's Dogma is definitely worth it. It's one of the wildest games of the last 10 years or so, offering up an epic adventure with all sorts of wonkiness to boot. That price will help the latter elements go down smoother, and given that it's not for everyone, even if you abandon it eventually you won't have spent too much on it.
In that sense, the sequel is a massive opportunity to correct the technical sins of its father. It took a long time, but Dragon's Dogma (partially through the Arisen release) garnered a lot of goodwill within the gaming community, as it was an honest effort at a unique open world experience, with a bit of flair. If they can shore things up with an updated RE Engine foundation, it could take off even more.

In 2021, Capcom released two exclusive charity skins for its formative fighter Street Fighter V — The skins, which were made available for franchise heroes Ryu and Chun-Li, were sold for $5.99 each, with Capcom promising to donate all proceeds of the sales to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF).
Yesterday, the publisher revealed that it had raised an impressive total of $75,000 USD for the Street Fighter V skins, money which Capcom states equates to around 1500 hours of research into the detection and curing of breast cancer, which remains one of the most predominant forms of the cellular disease, affecting millions of women across the globe each and every year.

Limited Run Games have teamed up with Tetris Effect, the Tetris-meets-meditation game, to create a series of limited-edition collectible physical releases of the game. Of course, there are the usual game-in-box versions, but who cares about those when you can get a real-life tetromino to cuddle at night?

Nintendo has given a little peek at a brand new map coming to Splatoon 3 when the game splats onto Switch later this year, and it's one that's hidden under the game's main hub, Splatsville.
This underground area is known as the Undertow Spillway, an abandoned area underneath the city that's recently been renovated into a place perfect for Turf Wars. While metallic and grey throughout, stickers, overgrowing wildlife, and white writing are dotted throughout the area. And any paint you throw at your rivals and the ground pops against the more muted tones.

Do you wake up each morning with a desire to beat the living hell out of street-roaming criminals? Don’t do it, we implore you. Prison isn’t worth it. While Final Fight and Streets of Rage may have been the violent video games that made you the addict to barbarism that you are today, take heart in the knowledge that your longing for combo-driven, body-piling antics hasn’t been totally forgotten.
Final Vendetta, from the UK’s Bitmap Bureau (Xeno Crisis) draws influence for its assault and battery from almost every scrolling beat-em-up ever made, cherry-picking the good stuff and reworking it into a whole new chapter of sidewalk vigilantism.

As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mean, good songs are kind of the norm in this series
So far, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is putting its best foot forward. We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called "A Life Sent On."
Shared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a "somber flute-based melody," which is played by "off-seers" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.
For now, I've listened to this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times now (even when writing this!) and it's giving me extremely good vibes for how the game will turn out. Aesthetically it seems to be nailing everything it needs to, as that's arguably been one of the stronger points of the series from the start: outdoing other similar games on the same hardware.
Hopefully we get even more quality of life upgrades and a killer story. There's a lot to improve upon in the second core game mechanically.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[June 24
Pokemon Snap 64 will make its debut on Nintendo Switch on June 24, Nintendo has announced. It'll join the newer 2021 iteration on the same platform.
Originally released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64, the picture-taking simulator became an instant cult classic. In a sense, it's the perfect game to come to a subscription service, as the concept is kind of out there, to the point where a lot of folks would never go out of their way to seek it out, but if a lot of those same people gave it a shot, they'd really enjoy it.
The Nintendo 64 side of things has been particularly slow-going, as far as the expansion pack is concerned. So originally Nintendo launched the service back in October with nine games. Since then they've doled out an additional game per month, including Paper Mario, Banjo Kazooie, Majora's Mask, F-Zero X, Mario Golf, Kirby 64, and now Pokemon Snap 64. That's a grand total of 16 games. The Genesis side has fared a little better, as Nintendo generally drops three or more games at once on that expansion pack line, albeit at a less regular cadence.
Switch Online is kind of all over the place in terms of value. Hopefully it'll improve at some point as early as this year.

Well, that's if you limit yourself to the game's actual mechanics. Breath of the Wild has seen numerous tricks, glitches, and exploits uncovered over the years, and YouTube channel Gaming Reinvented has once again come up with the goods, sharing a method that will let you sink right to the bottom of the ocean floor (or the lakebed) to take a little look and the hidden secrets underwater.

On top of the news that Overwatch 2 will be going free-to-play for its PvP mode, Blizzard has now revealed that the sequel will no longer be using Loot Boxes, and will be replacing this with a Battle Pass and an in-game shop to ensure fans can choose from what's on offer rather than rely on chance.

Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that "an objective review" from external advisors "determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence "suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board."
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that "there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units" in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, "based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard."

Clocking in at $39.99, Overwatch 2's first content bundle, dubbed the Overwatch Watchpoint Pack, does include a game you can play right now. It's the Legendary Edition of the original Overwatch which comes with some additional skins for characters and is probably necessary for the next piece of the bundle; purchasers will also be granted access to the upcoming Overwatch 2 beta, which starts on June 28. When the game launches into Early Access proper in October, the Watchpoint Pack covers the cost of the initial season pass and grants skins, in-game currency, and more.
Here are the entire contents of the Watchpoint Pack: 
Guaranteed access to the Overwatch 2 PvP Crossplay Beta (Beta begins June 28th, 2022)
Overwatch: Legendary Edition (includes five (5) Legendary Skins and five (5) Epic Skins)
Additional content granted to purchasers at the release of Overwatch 2 on October 4th
Premium Battle Pass: Season 1 - Two (2) Overwatch
2 Legendary Hero Skins - Space Raider Soldier 76 and Space Raider Cassidy
2000 Overwatch 2 Virtual Currency - Overwatch
2 Player Icon (Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack pre-purchase exclusive)
The Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack is available on all platforms Overwatch 2 which will be available: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Early Access of OW2 starts on October 4, and includes a new character, The Junker Queen.

Square Enix is remastering Crisis Core, and it's arriving pretty soon. Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a remaster of the 2007 prequel to Final Fantasy VII, and it's coming to PC and consoles this winter.
The news was announced during today's Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration showcase. The original Crisis Core is a prequel story to Final Fantasy VII proper, following Zack Fair's mission to find missing SOLDIER Genesis Rhapsodos. This new version looks to follow the same story, but with an updated look and feel.
Square Enix is calling it a full remaster. Reunion will have HD graphics and all 3D models refreshed. Dialogue will be fully voice-acted, and there's a new soundtrack arrangement as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRBiRFM2k0I
Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion is planned to launch on both PC and modern consoles. That means PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. No news on a firm date just yet.
All's Fair in love and remasters
According to Square Enix, you won't need to have played Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VII Remake in order to play Crisis Core Reunion. It also works as a standalone story, with its own adventure that unfolds.
That said, the expanded universe stuff is really all about seeing it all come together. And considering how Zack seems to be playing a big part in the also-announced Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, this might be a good bit of homework to do before next winter.

The big question is, obviously, will any of the story content change? Zack Fair's status in the Remake continuum is clearly quite different from the original. Remake also seems to be linked to the original series, in a very Rebuild of Evangelion manner. Things are about to get wacky and wild with the timeline and deeper lore questions. Hopefully we get some answers this winter.

Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is something we've been looking forward to for a while -- initially announced last year, this new title will bring the entirety of the Final Fantasy VII timeline to mobile platforms as a single-player, episodic experience. That's right, we're getting the story of the original Final Fantasy VII game, as well as all of its companion titles in one little package, as well as some new story elements surrounding the foundation of SOLDIER, as written by Kazushige Nojima. How fun!

During the Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary stream today, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is getting a closed beta sometime this year. The game will be free-to-play with in-game purchases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix not only revealed Final Fantasy VII’s second game, Rebirth, during today's 25th Anniversary presentation. It also answered a question fans have asked since this whole thing started: how many games does the saga consist of?
It turns out the answer is three. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that there’s only one untitled game left after Rebirth launches next year. Following a three-game roadmap is fitting given that the original Final Fantasy VII consisted of three discs on PS1. Kitase, unsurprisingly, did not give a window for when the final game will arrive.

Today, we got our first look at the next entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second of three planned entires, Square Enix confirmed today, and will arrive next winter for PS5.
The trailer closed out today's Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration.  In it, we see Cloud walking around in an open area, soon joined by Sephiroth. The pair walk around a massive area, as questions circle around.

Cut-in text asks what will happen to the planet, and what Sephiroth's endgame is. At one point, someone asks if she's some kind of impostor. Then we see Zack and Cloud, walking towards Midgar, same as they were in the ending of Final Fantasy VII Remake.

A cinematic trailer provided tantalizing glimpses of what’s to come, most notably gameplay of Cloud and Sephiroth exploring a section of the world together. While that may very well be a flashback, those who played Remake know that anything is possible at this point. Today's video also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second entry in what will be a three-game series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of Capcom's Dragon's Dogma 10th-anniversary celebrations, a sequel has finally been announced. Dragon's Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.


The announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that's passed since Dragon's Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game's director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name "Dragon's Dogma II," which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.
Before the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon's Dogma. It's a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.
There's no date for Dragon's Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company's RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Sorry to have kept you waiting"
During the Dragon's Dogma 10th anniversary stream, Capcom kept us waiting, but finally confirmed what we've all been waiting for: a sequel is happening! Dragon's Dogma II is real.
Game director Hideaki Itsuno spoke about his origins with RPGs and the development process for the still-unique-to-this-day Dragon's Dogma before showing his new t-shirt and confirming that, yes, Dragon's Dogma II is "currently in development."
Here's... the sequel's logo:

To be clear, no gameplay footage — not even a snippet — was shown. No window, either.
According to Itsuno, "everyone in the development team is hard at work creating a game that we hope you will enjoy." He closed the stream with a classic "please look forward to it," and that was it. After much speculation, I'm just glad it's now out in the open.
Dragon's Dogma is something of a flawed (and charmingly funny) gem, and while we did eventually get Dark Arisen, the time is right for a firing-on-all-cylinders sequel. The series has picked up fans over the years — it even got a Netflix anime adaptation — and it's clear that Itsuno is passionate about returning to high-fantasy role-playing action.

Imagine your Pawns in the RE Engine
After the stream, Capcom confirmed that Dragon's Dogma II will use the RE Engine.
Not that many games could get my imagination this fired up with just a logo announcement, but then again, Dragon's Dogma isn't most games. While details are basically non-existent at this point, it's easy to imagine how cool some of these creatures will look in a modern engine and how ridiculous our friendly neighborhood Pawns will be.
Coming off of Elden Ring, I'm so ready to see what Capcom can deliver.

Final Fantasy VII is considered one of the best games of all time, and as we celebrate its 25th anniversary, this game is the gift that keeps on giving. An enhanced and expanded version of the remake, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, is already available on the PS5 and the Epic Games Store. We learned today during the Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration stream that the Intergrade version is also going to be on Steam as of June 17, and the game will be playable on the Steam Deck as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4t1OFONu10
Intergrade comes bundled with INTERmission, which is new story content for the game featuring Yuffie as the main character. There are other new gameplay and content features, including Fort Condor, as part of the game as well.
Similar to the PC launch of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on the Epic Games Store, the Steam version costs $69.99 — but there's a discount knocking it down to $49.69 until July 7.

June isn't done yet, and this afternoon, we've got another gaming showcase to watch. It's about time to check out the Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration, which will be streaming live at 3:00 p.m. Pacific today. What's on the docket? Officially, Square Enix has promised "all the latest information relating to the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII."
Depending on who you ask (and which leaks you believe), this stream could touch on many different things — a Steam release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, a coveted glimpse of FFVII Remake Part 2, and potentially even some FFVII "expanded universe" news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wohQiEysqIA
You can watch the event live on YouTube and Twitch.
While the FFVII 25th Anniversary Celebration stream is supposed to be on the shorter side, the hype for this event has really snowballed in the past 24 hours, as is the way.
Admittedly, I'm less interested in hearing about stuff like The First Soldier and Ever Crisis, and with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 such an unknown quantity at this point, I'm sure many of you feel the same way. If we get anything concrete on the Naoki Hamaguchi-directed game, and maybe a fun wild-card announcement, I'll be happy. A few details — heck, even a bit of familiar imagery to latch onto — can go a long way while we wait.
(Worth reminding: if Dragon's Dogma is more your speed, Capcom is also hosting a 10th anniversary stream at the exact same time. I'm feeling reserved yet hopeful.)
Y'all ready for this?
Recap — that was a great showing!
Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is available on Steam tomorrow
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the next of the remakes, coming next winter
Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is getting a closed beta sometime this year
Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion arrives this winter for PC, consoles
It's nice to still feel a bit of that "E3" spark.

Neon White went live today, on Nintendo Switch and PC, for anime speedrunning freaks everywhere. But even if you're not into going fast in an anime world, you should also take some time to check out the Neon White OSTs from Machine Girl that hit Bandcamp today.
Artist Machine Girl composed not one, but two OSTs—or original soundtracks—for Neon White. They're the tunes that play in the background as you speed along, zipping from demon to demon and blazing through the outer limits of heaven. They're extremely good.
Check out this track, dubbed The Wicked Heart, from the first OST. It starts out at full throttle, with punchy drums and raw noise bleeding throughout the track. The melody drops in around the 1:13 mark and is one of my favorites in Neon White.
Neon White OST 1 - The Wicked Heart by Machine Girl
Neon White and catch some relaxed, easygoing beats. It's perfect for kicking back after a long day of setting records.
Neon White OST 2 - The Burn That Cures by Machine Girl
Tracks like Bloody Sneakers, the theme for Neon Violet, almost remind me of early PlayStation days. I think of the Racing Lagoon soundtrack, and in the best way possible.
Neon White OST 2 - The Burn That Cures by Machine Girl
Beats to blast your record in half
What I'm saying is, the Neon White OSTs are a jam. It's already a contender for best soundtrack of the year, in my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0b-qZTF0Mc
As for Neon White itself, it's great. I've spent the last week setting and then besting my times, competing with other early players along the way. It's anime as heck, like the sort of series you'd find on a VHS tape in the '90s at your local mom-and-pop rental place. Suffice to say, if you like going fast, Neon White is worth your time—and it's got some killer beats, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming to PC, Nintendo Switch, and yes, Atari VCS
If you ask me, not enough creators are playing in the WarioWare-esque microgame space. We got a new game last year on Nintendo Switch, sure, but a big part of the fun is that initial discovery phase before you've got every zany "think fast!" task figured out. With that in mind, I may not be super into Atari, but the idea behind Atari Mania sounds great.
Atari Mania has 150+ microgames built on the brand's legacy, from Pong to Adventure to Yars' Revenge. The team says that we'll "never think of Bentley Bear the same way again."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QErw-mKwLg
In the game, you'll play as the Atari Vault caretaker, so there's a wider story element to bind the '70s- and '80s-inspired microgames together. There are "dead pixels" to stop.
As for the gameplay structure, it'll be a gauntlet of escalating microgames in a random order, culminating in boss battles. So you'll need to be quick and consistent to survive.
Beyond today's trailer, Atari Mania developer iLLOGIKA also confirmed collectibles like "vintage Atari art, posters, manuals, and fun facts," along with "fully playable versions of remastered Atari classics" that can be unlocked via challenges.
[caption id="attachment_330595" align="alignnone" width="1920"] One of many microgames. Note the timer bar at the bottom.[/caption]
For me, it's mostly going to come down to the individual microgames more than anything else — are they fun? Surprising? How deep are these cuts? That said, it's good to hear that there's more substance with collectibles, and the price seems reasonable enough.
Atari Mania will launch on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Atari VCS this summer for $19.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[iOSterra
Square Enix has opened pre-registration for western players interested in its upcoming mobile RPG Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent. Interested parties can sign up for the new release ahead of its launch on iOS and Android platforms this summer.
Set once again in the lavish lands of Orsterra, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent will feature the fantasy RPG action and deep storytelling lore of the original 2018 adventure, stylized with that "retro 2D sprites on 3D rendered backgrounds" aesthetic that all of these mobile spin-offs tend to rock. Choose a party of "Chosen Ones" from the 64 available characters, before embarking upon a branching narrative packed with exploration, adventure, and oodles of juicy monster battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKYvONIJ3tE
"A few years prior to the events of Octopath Traveler, Orsterra is ruled by tyrants hungry for “wealth, power, and fame," reads an official blurb. "While the tyrants’ desires have unleashed a bottomless darkness upon the world… there are those who resist the darkness. You will meet them while traveling the world as “the Chosen Ones” of a divine ring. What will you obtain, and what will you experience through this journey? Soon the story will lead you to the tyrants of the land."
Champions of the Continent sports the stunning art style of its predecessor and features familiar and original tunes from series composer Yasunori Nishiki. Very unlike the original release, however, the mobile edition of Octopath Traveler is a free-to-play title that also features a variety of in-app purchases. I'm sure that you'd already put this together, but it's still worth clarifying.
Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent will launch on iOS and Android platforms this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[See some "show floor" demos from the comfort of home
The indie gaming side of Xbox is hosting another demo event this year, the ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo event. Starting on June 21, the ID@Xbox team says it will have over 30 demos of upcoming games playable on Xbox.
These demos will be up from June 21 through the 27th, so be sure to check them out while the window's open. And ID@Xbox notes that these demos are not the average demos you'd usually see on stores. While those usually come from fairly completed games, the ones in ID@Xbox are more akin to "show floor demos" you might catch at PAX or something. Basically, these are early-stage projects, so be constructive if things seem a little rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBskR9Pcv7o
The full list of demos is arriving closer to June 21, but ID@Xbox showed four of them today. These include:
Batora: Lost Haven: An isometric action game where you journey through colorful planets and fight to save Earth using your physical and mental superpowers.
Broken Pieces: A time-based thriller that seems ideal for Control fans, where you have to solve the mystery of this bizarre French village.
Severed Steel: One for the blood-pumping FPS fans, it's got bullet-time and destructible environments.
Tinykin: A Pikmin-style game that we've had our eye on for a while, with an incredible look and tons of little helpers.
Dozens of demos galore
It's already been a pretty good summer for demos. The Steam Next Fest is on right now, and there are a ton of upcoming projects to discover and add to your wishlist there.
Last year's ID@Xbox demo event had some pretty great hands-on previews in the lineup too. Games like Tunic, Lake, Sable, and more were all part of the 2021 demo fest. It'll be exciting to see what pops up in this year's event.

Chocks away, my furry friends, AkSys Games has released its cute, anthropomorphic shmup Horgihugh and Friends on Switch, bringing its challenging but totes-adorbs sky fighting action to the Nintendo platform. It is available to download from the eShop today, priced at around $30.
You can check out a trailer for the fun-looking arcade blaster below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbFFTZ706ew
In the aftermath of a brutal world war, a fantastical, furry take on the planet has fully disarmed itself of all weapons in order to prevent such an atrocity from taking place again. Unfortunately, the skies are now under siege from an invading intergalactic force, The Gozareans, and with nowhere else left to turn, it is up to a party of retired pilots to take to the air in their vintage battle planes, squaring up against the invaders despite being both outmanned and severely outgunned.
Horgihugh and Friends boasts cheerful, cartoonish artwork by industry veteran Kou (Shantae, Mega Man X2) and a rousing soundtrack composed by Motoaki Furukawa (Metal Gear, Policenauts). As animalkind's last hope, players will blast their way through six stages of pew-pew action, gathering power-ups, swiftly dodging a skyful of projectiles, and taking on a seemingly endless army of drones, captained by no less than 13 unique boss characters.
I'd been hoping to get to this release for review, but the relentlessness of the Not-E3 news season has unfortunately prevented me from doing so. Nevertheless, I'll be sure to check it out. Chocks Away!

Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.
Shredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”

First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All's well that ends well, though. In response to "overwhelming community response", Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

We’ve been hearing about Overwatch 2 since 2019, but nearly three years later, the game still hasn't been released. Through tumultuous development and terrible company-culture news out of Activision Blizzard, the Overwatch 2 development team has continued working on the game. As revealed on Sunday, the competitive multiplayer component will launch into early access on October 4. Today, Blizzard gave fans an additional glimpse of what to expect when this highly anticipated shooter sequel launches. We also hopped on a ca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past week, we've witnessed an obscene amount of trailers featuring promising upcoming games, many of which are coming from talented independent developers. Events like Steam's Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.
The ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of "show floor" demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren't complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.
Xbox isn't ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.
Batora: Lost Haven
Broken Pieces
Severed Steel
Tinykin
Some of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can't wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.]]></summary>

Admittedly, "world record" is less impressive when only developers and media have played, and I expect to be toppled soon after it launches today. Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I've had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I've stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

        <updated>2022-06-16T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

At this year's Summer Geoff Fest, I caught up with Flynn for another quick chat. This time, we dug into the game's recently revealed card crafting and realm-hopping features, as well as the choices you might make along the way.

However, PlayStation seemingly had other (accidental) plans as the publisher leaked everything about Part I hours before its official reveal. 
Keighley and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann took shots at PlayStation during the showcase, and it was clear the two were upset about the leak. Nonetheless, The Last of Us remake is real, and it’s out on Sept. 2. With all that behind it now, fans have begun to focus on the visual updates of Part I, which has seemingly split the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a sidescrolling beat ‘em up that aims to recapture the spirit of the TMNT arcade games from decades past, is both incredibly simple and a breath of fresh air. It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn't know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles carved its perfect niche in video games by way of the cooperative beat ‘em up. Titles like the 1989 arcade game and Turtles in Time let fans fulfill the fantasy of kicking shell alongside their friends, but it’s been a long time since our green heroes were the stars of a great video game. Shredder’s Revenge ends that drought, serving as a lovingly crafted homage to TMNT’s glory days that gives fans what they remember while sanding down most of the rough edges.

You might have to wait for some years to see anything from it though, as The Elder Scrolls 6 is only in “pre-production”. We’ll all be sporting Methuselah-length beards and have popped all the achievements in Starfield’s umpteenth DLC by then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall kicked off the recent Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase with a brand new look at gameplay. Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. 
Following that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. 


“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.'"
Smith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. 
Of course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase.

Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting's first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda and Xbox gave Starfield the spotlight during its recent weekend showcase, revealing more than 15 minutes of new footage and information from director Todd Howard. 
The studio didn’t mention this during the showcase, but shortly after, the Bethesda Game Studios Twitter account revealed some new details about dialogue in Starfield and how your created character – the protagonist of the game – interacts with NPCs. In short, speaking to NPCs will happen in first-person, and your character will remain silent as they do not have a voice.
Yes, dialogue in @StarfieldGame is first person and your character does not have a voice. pic.twitter.com/A8384m6rGN
June 13, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the studio has cleared up some possible confusion around the created character we’ll all be playing in Starfield. This reveal has been praised by some and criticized by others. Some Bethesda fans prefer the studio’s RPGs where you remain silent, while others prefer their character to have a voice they can hear in-game. 
I’m cool with either. I hope Starfield’s dialogue is more akin to Fallout 3 than Fallout 4, though. In the former, you’d see essentially all of the dialogue your choice would result in, whereas in Fallout 4, your choices were more like mood options, giving just a general view of that choice’s dialogue. It took away some of my character’s agency, and I’m hoping Starfield restores that a bit. Only time will tell for now, though. 
Starfield will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2023.
For more, read Game Informer’s Starfield analysis after its recent gameplay showing, and then check out this story about Todd Howard confirming that Fallout 5 is the next game Bethesda Game Studios will develop after Elder Scrolls 6 (which is the next game the studio will release after Starfield).

VideoCardz spotted the press release for the small-scale launch, which confirms some of the A380 specs, its comfort zone of 1080p / 60fps on medium quality settings, and a recommended price: 1030 yuan. That’s about £130 / $150, not accounting for regional tax maths.

Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support. Not bad at all!

The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you're willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That's a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/14/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-coming-after-elder-scrolls-6-shares-additional-starfield"/>
        <updated>2022-06-14T22:38:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a video interview with IGN, Bethesda’s Todd Howard divulged additional details about Starfield. He also uttered the name “Fallout 5” and gave an idea of when fans can expect to see it. 
Speaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 will be the next game after The Elder Scrolls 6, which itself has entered pre-production:
"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well."
Following up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield's main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. 
The game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. 
Starfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each time San Diego Comic-Con rolls around, we receive a ton of conference-exclusive collectibles to fawn over. While many of us will likely never get our hands on some of these unless we actually go to the show or find a vendor online, they're always fun to look at. This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.
This version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it's floating above its stand. While I haven't seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.

This San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a "2022 Summer Convention Exclusive" sticker or the "2022 San Diego Comic-Con" sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn't guaranteed. This year marks the iconic convention's grand return to the San Diego Convention Center for the first time since 2019. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 21 to July 24.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show's end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.


The Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.
The other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it's nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don't expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.
If you can't wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it's available to purchase right now on Steam.]]></summary>

So it is with Outpost, a first-person base-builder with seemingly massive swarms that impressed during the Future Games Show. How does it look in the 8 minutes of playtest footage below? Less impressive - but still compelling.

Industria’s inspirations are clear from the jump: Half-Life 2, David Lynch movies, and more. It’s something the six-person team at Bleakmill has mentioned when discussing Industria online that had me excited. You play as Nora, a worker for the East Berlin-based company Atlas, just before the end of the Cold War. Your lover disappears, and you set off to find him, only to wind up in a parallel dimension where machines have taken over what used to be home. Sadly, the four hours following this mysterious and intriguing start fail to live up to t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GSC Game World has confirmed that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will now arrive in 2023. To hold fans over, the team released a new cinematic during today's Xbox Games Extended Showcase.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was put on hold when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game's development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.
Meanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's gloomy atmosphere.  


In addition, a developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia's invasion and how it banded together amidst days of bombings (contains disturbing imagry of the war so viewer discretion is advised).


S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.]]></summary>

The reveal trailer showcased a more realistic-looking Sora in a much different world, ushering the series into a new era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a "farmadventure", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a "survival game without survival"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GoldenEye 007 redefined the shooter genre when it launched on Nintendo 64 in 1997. Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare's acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the influential FPS. 


The trailer, uploaded on IGN, features snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight. 
GoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light 2 Stay Human's roadmap revealed five years of planned DLC. A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update – 1.4.0 – drops today with the first "Chapter," bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure. 
So, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission. 
Of course, there's also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun – we're talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph. 
Like its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG. So, eager Pilgrims will have many opportunities to expand upon Aiden's already-harrowing journey.
Will you be diving into the 1.4.0 update today? Let us know your impressions in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.

As far as I'm concerned, when the game can no longer process just how ridiculous my run is, I've beaten it and I win. Reader dear, I'm delighted to say I finally managed that in 20 Minutes Till Dawn.

Revealed as part of their not E3 livestream, the Winter's Expansion will include three seperate additions to entice fans back into its world of tall vampire ladies and weird dog men.
The first is Shadow Of Rose, a story expansion set after the events of the base game that focuses on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters. In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious "powers", Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village. Players will guide Rose through a number of spooky locales, including what appears to be Castle Dimetrescu from the game's main campaign.

In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight's Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

While the Jungle sounds like it would be strictly filled with trees and other foliage, it's situated on the coast and offers plenty of sandy beaches and ruins to explore.


As for new monsters to hunt, Sunbreak has a lot of exciting new targets to take on. Espinas makes its return from Monster Hunter Frontiers. As its name implies ("espinas" is Spanish for thorns), this creature is covered in sharp spines that wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.
Exoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.


Those mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.
Interestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.
Capcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.
Exoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/capcom-showcase/2022/06/13/heres-your-first-look-at-resident-evil-4-remake-gameplay"/>
        <updated>2022-06-13T22:34:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. 
Director Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president's daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don't go well. 


We then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. "We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original," Hirabayashi said during the presentation. "Of course, there will also be thrilling battles."
You'd be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. 
I'm more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would've loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn't in the cards today. Here's hoping we'll get a better look in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil Village made a surprise return during today's Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.


In this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she's struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that's where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.
Capcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.
Lastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.
If you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won't have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter's Expansion, which contains all three additions. Capcom is planning to release this content on October 28.]]></summary>

        <id>118546</id>
        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/13/psa-new-playstation-plus-tiers-available-today-upgrading-converts-to-yearly-plan"/>
        <updated>2022-06-13T16:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here's everything you'll need to know about upgrading your plan.
Three tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. 
Upgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you'll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don't panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. 
How To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly
There are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts > Accounts > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions. In there, you'll find your PS+ subscription. Once you've entered your subscription details, you can change your plan. 
Selecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you'd like to pay for on a recurring basis. 
Once you've locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you're ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you're not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abib the troubadour killed an ancient evil spirit by throwing his knife at it. Tinyfolks is not a "story generator" sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.


There's no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn't matter that you're a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you'll have a great time doing it.

It’s the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it’s also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is the next big new game from Bethesda Game Studios, and it's a pretty big deal because they haven't made something that isn't a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game in like... ever. So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

Nivalis is a slice-of-life sim set in the same cyberpunk city as hovercar courier game Cloudpunk, where we'll get to run bars and restaurants, grow ingredients, fish, make friends, and maybe even find love. So like a cyberpunk Stardew Valley? Have a look in the new trailer.

Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.

Sonic Frontiers raced among 2022’s most anticipated games when it debuted during the 2021 Game Awards. Sega has been secretive about what the open-world – or rather “open-zone” – game entails, agonizing fans eager to learn how the hedgehog fares in a larger world. During Summer Game Fest Play Days, I spent 30 minutes playing Frontiers to get a sense of how the adventure is shaping up so far. I still have many questions, but I walked away with clearer expectations and some glimmers of hope.

A big selling point is that every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, from lowly farmer to high rolling capitalist, each having preferences and beliefs. Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.

But that's the future. Right now, the game has received a taste of far future with the release of Halo Infinite's Pelican aircraft as a real plane you can really fly in Flight Sim.

The rule for this showcase, as outlined early on, is that every game shown will launch within the next 12 months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An unexpected and fun surprise from the PC Gaming Show was the reveal of Klei Entertainment's newest game. Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.


Thanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.
In typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.
The trailer gave an early access date of "202?" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.]]></summary>

The very concept of Metal: Hellsinger appeals to me from the first note: Slay demons in a modern Doom-style first-person shooter to the beat of newly recorded tracks from some big names in rock and metal. As someone who grew up playing the original Doom and loves the modern iterations of the franchise, and has perhaps sunk more time into the Rock Band series than any other franchise, The Outsiders' upcoming game checks a lot of boxes. Still, coming into my hands-on time with the game, I was skeptical. Thankfully, the short demo I played at Summer Game Fest (which is also a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long absence, Nightdive Studio's remake of System Shock made an appearance at the PC Gaming Show, and it's looking pretty cool. You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.


This new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game's visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.
System Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alters wants you to think about how small choices can change the type of person you are, like a big science fiction Sliding Doors. Only, since it's the new game from the developers of Frostpunk and This War Of Mine, I'm guessing the stakes are higher than whether Gywneth Paltrow gets it together with John Hannah. For one, you're creating alternatve versions of yourself in order to survive on a rickety base rolling across an alien world.

Now the publishers Frozen Forge are back with The Constructors, revealed at the PC Gaming Show. The Constructors is a simulation game allowing you to climb up another rung on the parasite ladder (following on from last year's landlord sim The Tenants, by the same devs Ancient Forge Studio) as you own a constuction company, and build and design housing estates.

The blend of action-adventure, stealth and seething hordes of rats is getting a sequel later this year, taking our miserable medieval tots Amicia and Hugo to the south of France for A Plague Tale: Requiem. In a gameplay trailer shown at the Xthesda showcase tonight we saw that Amicia is struggling with whether or not she should kill the heck out of soldiers, or try to stealth on by.

But at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase tonight they were able to share that Diablo 4 is coming out next year for some much anticipated ARPG antics. Why, that's the Diablo game people keep saying they want!
Plus, the Necromancer is confirmed as the fifth playable class. There's a moody trailer that tries to make being a Necromancer sound twisted and dangerous and a hard path to walk, but it mostly makes it sound like Necromancers are cool badasses with loads of skeleton best friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Passed almost a quarter of a century ago, the DMCA prevents citizens from repairing many of their own electronic devices. The proposed Freedom to Repair Act 2022 seeks to fix this problem by allowing circumvention in strictly limited circumstances. This week the proposal was labeled "pro-piracy legislation" but is that a fair assessment or an expected overreaction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trailer for Morbid Metal from tonight's Future Games Show had a lot of metal (the music genre) and metal (the stuff you make blades out of). Morbid Metal is a hack 'n' slash, but the difference here is that you have four different mech lads at your disposal, and you can morph between them whenever you like. This real-time switching means Morbid Metal moves very quickly. You might think hyphenated phrases like "high-octane", "action-packed", and "fast-paced" are moving in the direction of this game, but buddy this is going at such speed that they're already here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
