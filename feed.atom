Unfortunately, a clip has surfaced that clearly shows that at least a small part of the community could be cheating to win unfairly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the mightiest foes Goku and Vegeta ever fought, as well as for manySuper's best antagonist, it's no surprise that Fused Zamasu is among the best characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.


But in true Budokai Tenkaichi style, his status as a late-game character will mean only one thing, you will have to put in the work to unlock him. Here are all the ways in which you can unlock Fused Zamasu in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.


How to Unlock Fused Zamasu in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero


Similarly to Goku Black, you can unlock Fused Zamasu in Sparking Zero by either purchasing him from the game's shop for 120,000 Zeni (only after reaching Player Level 20) or by summoning Super Shenron, heading to ”I want more characters” and then selecting him. For those looking to prioritize Goku Black when making their wish, it's important to point out that not having Fused Zamasu as an unlocked character won't stop you from performing his fusion.

Unlike your player level, which will be raised after each battle, those who purchased the game's standard and Collector's editions will be able to unlock Super Shenron in Sparking Zero by completing the main path of Goku's storyline (or Episode Battle). Those who purchased the game's Ultimate Edition, on the other hand, will be able to perform one summon from the get-go. You will also get free summons by completing both the Future Trunks and Jiren Episode Battles. 


Can you unlock the Gohan Black variant of Fused Zamasu?


Seen during Gohan's The Strongest Warrior Sparking! Episode, it is currently impossible to unlock the Gohan Black variant of Fused Zamasu in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, although the only difference between the two seems to be in the character's voice and hairstyle.

You first need to get the quest called “[Event] Invited to the Snowy Realm” from Ankh in Meyer’s Market in Broken Delta, a level 12 zone. You can find the quest-giving NPC by looking for the glowing guitar icon on the world map. Ankh asks you to bring her 5 Blueberry Juice and 5 Orange Juice, both recipes that you know by default.

Now, the company has confirmed it'll come to the Cloud, too, on the same day.


In an Xbox Wire blog post, Microsoft has announced Black Ops 6, as well as Call of Duty's Battle Royale Warzone and last year's Modern Warfare 3, will be coming to Cloud Gaming on October 25.


You can play Black Ops 6 on your phone


As per the blog, on October 25 (Black Ops 6's launch day), all three games will arrive on Xbox Cloud Gaming. 


"We’re thrilled to reveal that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be playable with Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) for Game Pass Ultimate members at launch and will begin rolling out to players on October 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. PT," it reads.


"In addition, we’re also bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming support to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone for Game Pass Ultimate members on the same day."


It'll be interesting to see how popular Modern Warfare 3 is on mobile with its successor dropping on the service the same day, but there's always room for Favela and Rust in our hearts.


Black Ops 6 will mark the first Day One Game Pass launch since Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, with Modern Warfare 3 coming to the subscription service just a few months ago.


This month has already been a solid month for the service, with Inscryption and Sifu being added, as well as MLB The Show 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA FC 25's Title Update 3 has been announced, and it's the biggest set of changes since the game's launch on September 27. 


The official patch notes have been released by EA Sports, and the update will be available shortly on the old-gen consoles. However, the new patch is also likely going to make its way onto current-gen systems, including PC. If the changes work as expected, the upcoming changes are going to have some massive effects on the general gameplay.

Title Update 3's patch notes clearly highlight the changes coming to general gameplay. It's pretty clear that the developers have considered the recent feedback from the community, and planned some of the changes accordingly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Press 'X' to Neva.
In the first of couple years of the Switch, one of the standout indie games was an artsy little platformer called GRIS, which combined simple gameplay with incredible visuals to make for a memorable and touching experience. It feels fitting, then, that developer Nomada Studio has managed to produce and release a spiritual successor called Neva in the twilight of the Switch’s lifespan, bookending its time in the spotlight with another artistic experience that very much carries on the essence of Gris and expands upon it in some notable ways. Though it won’t last you terribly long, Neva is a memorable, emotional, and beautiful adventure that we’d suggest you pick up as soon as you can.
The game follows the story of a lone swordswoman named Alba and her titular wolf companion, Neva. Their journey begins when the wolf is just a pup with the two of them and Neva’s mother exploring a beautiful landscape, only for the group to be accosted by a furious storm of shadow demons. They bravely hold their own, but the Neva’s mother is killed in the onslaught. Mourning the loss, Alba and Neva make it out relatively unscathed, and the two then set out on a long journey to fight back against the encroaching corruption that the shadow demons bring to the land.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neva is the Sophomore effort from Nomada Studio, who you may remember from their beautiful, dreamy platformer Gris. Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti. "So when we stumbled into Mörk Borg, and then we started to play, we looked at each other in the eyes and said, 'Why don't we make a game out of it?'"

In a break from usual proceedings, this one isn't about 'Switch 2' (at least, not entirely). Instead, the latest speculation is focused on the GameCube controller and how it might, might, be making a comeback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty hyped for the recently-announced Tomb Raider IV-VI remasters by Aspyr, but maybe not for the healthiest of reasons. 


Many years of surviving disappointing video game releases forced me to evolve into a state where I enjoy masterpieces and absolute train wrecks all the same. To me, the only bad game is a formulaic and uneventful one. In case you're wondering, I loved the original batch of remasters from Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Trilogy because they provide competent and surprisingly soulful ways to play amazing classics. The second trilogy, however, will require more than just good polishing.


I know Aspyr will pull off IV and V, The Last Revelations and Chronicles, respectively. Tough task, as that's where the series began to falter. IV was the first entry to tinker a bit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long gone are the days when almost every game development studio came up with its own proprietary game engine. It's been a long time coming, but we're finally at the stage where Unreal Engine 5 truly dominates the industry, and I feel this isn't a good thing at all.


One could argue about the ubiquity of Unreal Engine all day long, granted. The engine's claim to fame began way, way back in the days of Unreal Engine 2, only for it to develop into one of the go-to third-party development solutions as Epic Games moved to release Unreal Engine 3. It's difficult to overstate the importance of UE, as we've had close to a thousand games produced on UE3 and UE4 in the past. UE5, in comparison, is even more monumental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Name a more iconic Duo, I'll wait.
Though the Ys series has been around for decades now (it even predates Final Fantasy), its release history in the West was rather inconsistent until the mid-2000s and the series only really became relevant again to the Nintendo fanbase with the release of Ys VIII in 2018. After a decent follow-up a few years ago with Ys IX, Falcom has now opted to squeeze out one more new entry for the Switch before its much-awaited successor inevitably steals the spotlight. Ys X: Nordics provides yet another strong, enjoyable adventure for Adol and Dogi, effortlessly demonstrating that there’s still a lot of life left in this long-running franchise.
Ys X places you once again in the shoes of the famed red-haired adventurer Adol Christin, who’s travelling with his friends Dogi and Dr. Flair to Celceta to help the doctor with some restorative flowers research. The group is travelling by boat through the Obelia Gulf, but are soon accosted by some Normans—a seafaring group of local enforcers who both maintain order and bully locals. Adol and his party end up landbound after the conflict, but his woes worsen when a Norman leader named Karja attempts to duel Adol on the beach and the two become inseparably bound together by a pair of magical ‘Mana Cuffs’ that they can’t remove.

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

When is Warframe 1999 going to be released?


While there is no strict date set for the Warframe 1999 update, we do know that it will be coming in Winter 2024, which will highly likely end up being sometime in December. The update is slated to be rather beefy thanks to the subject matter, but we'll let you know the details once more have been released.

There's plenty of stuff to do beyond the compressed main "quest", and the new Vesper's Host dungeon is fun, too. If you're not playing it solo, that is.


It would seem that Vesper's Host suffers from at least some of the same problems that have been popping up in Bungie's dungeons ever since Ghosts of the Deep launched. Notably, Bungie has once again chosen to turn the dungeon's boss fights into grindy ordeals thanks to their massively inflated health pools. When you've got two more pals jumping around the place, this isn't such a huge deal, but going at it solo is a wholly different beast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the cutest type of eyeball? This question has plagued the games industry since Nintendo first allowed millions of unsupervised children to play god with Mii avatars and their customisable peepers. In low-stakes fishing game Webfishing, you can give your fuzzy avatar one of 33 styles of eye (I counted). This is the mark of a solid Animal Crossing-like. There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're not satisfied with the massive cast of characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Goku (Mini) is one specific form that could be on your bucket list.


It's pretty clear that Dragon Ball DAIMA will have a fair share of influence on at least a few of the characters inside the game. While it's expected that the upcoming characters in future DLCs could have a fair few from those who are present in the new show, you can already play with Goku (Mini) in the game. Unlike most of the unlockable characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the smaller form of Goku's accessibility will be an issue for some.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In remastered form, no less.
The creepy survival horror game Forgotten Memories was announced for Wii U way back in 2013. The port never materialised, but it seems developer Psychose Interactive has pivoted to the modern market as it has announced that Forgotten Memories: Remastered Edition will be coming to Switch on 28th October.
This remaster takes the base mobile game and gives it what appears to be a pretty substantial facelift. The upcoming release is treated to updated visuals, new advanced lighting effects, a revamped score, gameplay improvements and a new 'Insane' game mode, amongst other tweaks. In short, if you were waiting for it on Wii U, this certainly seems like it'll be the best way to play.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

Ever since the announcement that Nintendo would reveal its Switch successor at some point "this fiscal year", our minds have been drifting to what such a big announcement could possibly entail. Because, let's not forget, the OG Switch reveal kicked off with a strange photo of Mario peeking around a curtain — something former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang were keen to unpack on the latest episode of their podcast (thanks for the heads up, Nintendo Everything).
According to the pair's answer, the photo was "very controversial", with Nintendo worrying the image wouldn't adequately manage people's expectations. According to Kit, "You always need more assets than you think you do" with a big announcement like a console reveal, but Nintendo didn't have anything fitting for this occasion so had to turn to a "last-second" photoshoot.

Where to get an Archwing Launcher Segment in Warframe


The Archwing Launcher Segment is an Orbiter modification that allows you to install an Archwing Launcher on your ship. This, as a result, will enable you to deploy your Archwing in open-field areas (Cambion Drift, Plains of Eidolon, and Orb Vallis).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Post Void is a masterpiece of compulsive motion and hypnotic, irresistible sounds," wrote Sin of YCJY Games's "orgiastic" shooter. "It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it.

It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right.

With today's AMD 5th Gen EPYC "Turin" launch, Zen 5 is coming to servers and delivers stunning performance and power efficiency. The new top-end AMD EPYC Turin processor performance can obliterate the competition in most workloads and delivers a great generational leap in performance and power efficiency. Here are our first 5th Gen AMD EPYC Turin benchmarks in looking at the EPYC 9575F, EPYC 9755, and EPYC 9965 processors across many workloads and testing in both single and dual socket configurations.]]></summary>

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven.

Kind Words 2 is full of touching and drifting remarks like this, written by other players and tossed into the winds for you to find. If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023.

Stop reading now if you’re still playing, obviously. Here’s a video of a cat that sounds like he’s saying “bongiorno” you can watch instead.

On his return, Dotcom said X had suspended his account, based on an extremely serious allegation. After accusing Elon Musk of failing to help, yesterday Dotcom warned that a Trump loss would see Musk indicted and "fighting for his life." Dotcom has a plan to avoid extradition; chaos like this provides the fuel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in July, the Powers That Be at Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Ziff Davis laid off all 36 members of Humble Games, in response to "challenging economic times for indie game publishing". Now, Humble Games's former general manager Alan Patmore and global publishing VP Mark Nash have founded Good Games Group, a new indie publisher who will work with many of the same development partners from their Humble days. They're also partnering with Ziff Davis again, providing support for Humble's previously released games.

Partly hence the G515 Lightspeed TKL keyboard post from yesterday.

Which is harsh, because they can provide heaps of capacity at relatively attainable prices, as the Crucial BX500 is currently demonstrating. Per Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon UK is running the 2TB version for just £92 (34% off) as well as 4TB for £178 (41% off). Meanwhile, Amazon US is lopping 43% off the 1GB model, bringing it down to $54, with the 4TB model shedding 13% to reach $210.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 won't be an "open sim" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <updated>2024-10-09T11:49:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US. Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

Despite releasing this year, it’s designed to fit the last-gen AM4 motherboard socket – which sounds strange, because it is, but then the 5700X3D is also the cheapest Ryzen chip to feature AMD’s extremely game-friendly 3D V-Cache tech. The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK.

Which is a shame, as the OLED gaming monitors I’ve used have invariably looked sumptuous, without the movement blurring issues you might expect if you own a TV of the same panel tech. Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

I don’t know anymore, this is like the third or fourth one this year. But I do know a good gaming keyboard when I see one, and this latest sale has the lovely Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL down from £140 to £119. Its first UK discount since launch, no less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No game protagonist is more willing to stick his hand down a toilet than James Sunderland. Why is he doing this? You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

There's no firm release date yet, but we're told it'll be ready some time next year.

They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those dril tweets about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

Those requirements have since lowered and risen, and now we know for sure that nu-Silent Hill 2 is one tough customer for performance – albeit one that benefits greatly from just one or two key settings tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, "interoperable" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not. Stealth blockchain post? Genuinely, I can neither confirm nor deny.

My spine now resembles a splinter of charred wood, but oh, so worthwhile. It's an absolute godsend as the days get brisker. My flatmate keeps telling me I shouldn't keep the window wide open if I'm getting cold, but he doesn't understand. I need the airflow. I can handle the chill, but if the air's too still, things go downhill!
So, now that we're all sitting comfortably atop our heat pads: what are we all playing this weekend? Let's take a looksie at what we're all clicking on here in the treehouse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windblown is an action roguelite much like Dead Cells, the previous game from developer Motion Twin, but it trades sidescrolling 'vania vibes for a 3D and more colourful world, and adds co-op for up to three pals. That sounds plenty appealing, and it now has a release date: October 24th. 

Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest.

He’s mental, he is! Has half a lemonade shandy with lunch sometimes, and wears one of those t-shirts that look like a tuxedo. Absolute mentalist! Anyway, after reviewing Grunn last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade. Grunn just released today, and my high level tempter is that it’s a little bit like Outer Wilds, just with all the touching wonder replaced by spooky whimsy. Here’s a trailer:

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun.

Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.

Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.

The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.
