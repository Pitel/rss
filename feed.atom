This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

Updates can be just as significant, but the Reloaded patches tend to be on a smaller scale. However, that has since changed with CoD Patch 5.5, which contains much more content than usual. So, if you're wondering why Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season 5 Reloaded update is so big, here's what you need to know. 


Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season 5.5 update size, explained


The MW3 and Warzone Season 5 Reloaded patch aims to gear up for Black Ops 6 Beta and implement new mechanics to the game. That's why it'll be more significant than other Reloaded patches as the launch date for the Beta draws near.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lukas Klostermann FUTTIES SBC is now live in EA FC 24 and it features a special card of the Red Bull Leipzig footballer.


Not only has Klostermann received a new promo card after several months, but all players have equal chance at playing with the item. To do so, just finish the SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at how you can unlock this card, and if doing so makes any sense or not. 


EA FC 24 Lukas Klostermann FUTTIES SBC tasks


With just one task, there won't be any problem to complete the Lukas Klostermann FUTTIES SBC. There's plenty of ways to grind the required fodder in the current season.


 Task 1 - Lukas Klostermann



Min. 1 Players from: Bundesliga


Min. Team Rating: 89



EA FC 24 Lukas Klostermann FUTTIES SBC solutions


Here's the solutions for completing the Lukas Klosterman FUTTIES SBC in EA FC 24. 


Task 1 - Lukas Klostermann



Erling Haaland: 91


Kevin De Bruyne: 91


Harry Kane: 90


Ruben Dias: 89


Rodri: 89


Sandra Panos: 87


Lena Oberdorf: 87


Ewa Pajor: 87


Gregor Kobel: 87


Martin Odegaard: 87


Lautaro Martinez: 87



While this Klostermann card is positioned as a CB, I won't want to use him over there. He's better suited as a RB, and his playstyle+ also suit that position pretty well. Do remember he's cheap, and the card isn't exactly meta. This SBC is targeted more towards those who had started playing since the beginning of the FUTTIES season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Madden NFL 25, you can personalize the game presentation by altering the camera angles based on your personal preferences.


Doing so has several benefits, as your chosen camera angle will have telling effects on your gameplay. If you're trying to play in an unfamiliar setting, some or most of your plays in offense and defense could go awry. To avoid this, you can select from various choices available in the in-game settings.


All camera angles in Madden NFL 25


The camera angles in this game are divided into two broad categories - offense and defense. Here are the available options for both.


Offense



Standard


All-22


Broadcast


Zoom



Defense



Standard


All-22


Broadcast


Zoom


Defensive Perspective



Do note that a pass zoom in option is available with the Zoom camera. While the available options are almost the same, you have the benefit of a Defensive Perspective when it comes to defense.

How to change the camera angle in Madden NFL 25


For some strange reason, the camera angle isn't present in Graphics. Instead, you'll need to switch to Visual Feedback from the in-game settings. Once you've found the tab, scroll down to find the section on camera angles. Choose your preferred angles, then return to the main menu to save your changes.


Best camera angle in Madden NFL 25


While this depends entirely on your preference, I have yet to find a reason to switch from Standard. The Standard camera angles work well in both offense and defense. Whether you're playing against the AI or another human, I have found no issues using these angles.


My preference could change with time based on how the other angles work. For now, Standard is undoubtedly the best choice for most players.

Their energy levels will naturally drop based on the minutes they spend on the field. In one-off exhibition matches, it might not matter a lot.

Anime Last Stand offers many units to try out through Summons or trading, each harnessing a specific rarity type. We'll start with the S Tier units, characters with the highest amounts of DPS and AoE. However, getting this bunch will be challenging, as they will have many more requirements than the others. If you're starting out or in the mid-range part of your journey, opt for the lower tiers for better…]]></summary>

We've got a concrete list of all new guns and gun-related features listed in the notes, for one, so it's an interesting read.


Escape From Tarkov's patch 0.15 has been a long time coming, featuring a rework of the game's very first map, a new Karma system for keeping track of the players' in-game "honor," a boss that spawns depending on the players' Karma, the ability to travel from one location to the next using loading zones, and - of course - the tripwires themselves. Tripwires alone would've been a meta-defining feature, but they're coming out as part of a fairly substantial content update that is impressive in every sense of the word.…]]></summary>

Notably, we'll soon be able to perform Exotic Class Item attunement, tweaking the odds of getting meaningfully powerful drops well ahead of time.


Attunement isn't a new concept in Destiny 2, of course. It's a passive system that allows players to fine-tune their future drops and make it more likely that they are of a specific type, as previously seen with the BRAVE weapon set during the Into the Light era of Destiny. BRAVE weapons' attunement is due to make a triumphant return due to how popular and useful it was, and it will seemingly extend to cover Exotic Class Items, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February 2024, Supermarket Simulator released into Early Access and, surprisingly, took the gaming world by storm. For a while, you couldn’t escape playthroughs on streaming platforms and everyone seemed to be talking about it. 


Since then, Supermarket Simulator has had a lot of patches and the most recent one on August 20 is a game changer in many ways, but mainly because it finally adds full controller support to the game. However, this massive change isn’t the only useful thing to be added.

What’s the most useful thing in any grocery store? No, it’s not the price tags (although admittedly they are pretty useful), it’s the aisle signs. Patch v0.2.1 finally gives you the glorious ability to label your aisles and not only does this add a layer of realism into your store, but also allows you to remember where things go when stock levels plummet. 


As well as this, we’ve finally been blessed with self checkouts. Say what you like about them, they’re definitely cheaper to run than hiring cashiers and they also free up a lot of floor space for more stock, increasing not only your range of stock, but also your profit margins.

And last, but definitely not least, we’ve now got a whole new bunch of store customization options on top of those already added in the previous customization update back in June. Patch v0.2.1 brings even more choices for the exterior appearance of your store, so you can really make it your own.

There were other small additions in this patch, including further Restocker options and speakers which will pump music into your store, as well as minor bug fixes. Sadly, the bugbear of only being able to move stock in boxes which are considered to be the ‘right’ size is still in existence, but we can’t have everything.

How to make or buy Tea in Fields of Mistria


To get Tea in Fields of Mistria, you’ve got a couple of choices, but neither of them can happen before you’ve upgraded the General Store and unlocked the full variety of seeds on offer. After doing this, not only will you be able to purchase Tea Seeds for 300 Tesserae from the General Store itself, but you’ll also be able to purchase grown Tea at Balor’s Wagon for 400 Tesserae as long as it is in stock. 


If you choose to grow your own Tea, you’ll need to plant it in the Summer, and it will take five days to reach maturity before going on to produce one Tea per plant every three days. This Tea then sells for 135 Tesserae each, and can be used in a variety of different Tea based recipes.

The news arrives via a development update from the developer and publisher, showing some more in-development and behind-the-scenes footage of the game. Alex Skidmore, creative director at The Chinese Room, says the team is in the late production phase, "iterating and polishing" what's there.


But as Paradox's Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja states, the publisher has "reaffirmed" its commitments to delivering quality games, and that does apply to Bloodlines 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the roster of annual events in Final Fantasy XIV, few come with such heartwarming stories as The Rising. Every year in August, director and producer Naoki Yoshida appears as an in-game character to express his thanks for continued support, along with a few inspirational words of encouragement. 


The Rising celebrates the anniversary of FFXIV's rebirth as A Realm Reborn, after the end of Version 1.0. It’s a chance to not only share in the celebration of what will this year be the 11th anniversary of A Realm Reborn, but also to remember those who perished during the Seventh Umbral Calamity despite the efforts of Louisoix on the Carteneau Flats. 




In 2024, FFXIV's The Rising event runs from August 27 at 3 a.m. EST until September 11 at 11 p.m. EST, and you’ll be able to begin the event quest by talking to the Wandering Minstrel in Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks. There aren't many clues on the Lodestone yet about the contents of this year’s event quests, but the tagline is “Flowers bloom over the ocean, breathing the perfume of the past”. 


Regardless of what the event entails, as always, there are some rewards up for grabs if you take part. This year, you’ll get the Brushed-up Krile minion for participating, which is utterly adorable and a rare glimpse of Krile without her almost surgically attached hood and her newly obtained Pictomancer weapon. 





There’s also a secondary housing item, likely purchased for Gil from the event vendor. The Rising Table Lamp is a slightly bizarre choice and doesn’t quite scream ‘The Rising’ to me, but it probably won’t be too expensive and I’m sure my specified event items Retainer won’t mind holding on to it for me until I can find a use for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can’t say I normally pay close attention to the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference (CEDEC), but this year (as spotted by Twitter user gosokkyu), it is presenting the Engineering Division Award for Excellence to Hitoshi Iizawa for their very important work in arcade emulation. Not just any arcade emulation, but emulation of the early 3D-era Sega Model 2 and Model 3 platforms.


In terms of game preservation, arcade games are a difficult area. Each game could be on its own hardware or hardware variation. While console emulation focuses on recreating the hardware in a way that can run its library of games, a lot of arcade games have to be approached individually. Add to that the fact that 3D game hardware is much harder to emulate, and it can be a struggle.


The emulation was done specifically to fill out the arcades in the games by Ryu ga Gotoku studios. Games in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon/Judgment series had full recreations of Sega’s old arcade titles, such as Fighting Vipers, Virtua Fighter 2, and Sega Bass Fishing. Not only are the games present, but the cabinets themselves (such as the Sega Blast City) are presented in painstaking detail.


The award states that it’s in recognition of Iizawa’s technical expertise, as well as for presenting the buried games for today’s players. His work in porting old arcade games goes back to the ‘00s where he worked on Sega Ages 2500: Virtua Fighter 2 and later helped port Daytona USA to PS3 and Xbox 360.


There has been some progress in emulating Model 2 and Model 3 games by fan communities. However, having an official means to play these games is always a plus. I would like to see some titles from these platforms make their way to storefronts, rather than being contained as games within a game. Hopefully, this work will eventually lead to that.

Secondly, there are slim chances (roughly 25%) of the Sim returning with an alien baby brewing in their belly, and this can only happen to male Sims in the game. Female Sims can also get abducted, but they will only return with a moodlet.


There’s no set pattern or guarantee for the alien abduction to occur in The Sims 4. However, there are ways to increase the chances of an alien abduction in The Sims 4. First, keep in mind that the abduction can only occur any time between 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. Moreover, Sims who are scientists are more likely to get abducted.

Sims 4 Alien Abduction: How to increase your chances



Join the “Get to Work Scientist Career” with your Sim if you haven’t already.


Unlock the Out of this World Desktop which is attained at Level 4. You can find the desktop in Electronics > Computer. You will also unlock the Satellite Dish at Level 4 which can be found in Electronics > Misc. Both will work for this method. (You can also use cheats in Sims 4 for this step).


Choose the Contact Aliens option on either of the devices.


Interact with the Telescope (Observatory) and choose the Search for the Truth option. The option is unlocked by reaching Level 7 Logic. Make sure you use this during the evening to increase the chances of the abduction when it’s nighttime.



Following these steps should increase your chances of an alien abduction in The Sims 4. Keep repeating the process until the abduction happens. Good luck!

Months after Starbreeze's promises, here we are with a new courthouse Heist DLC.


Priced at $11.99 or your regional equivalent, Payday 3: Chapter 3 - Houston Breakout is a bundle containing two separate micro-DLCs and the titular Houston Breakout heist. On top of the heist, buyers also get the Tailor Pack with a suite of cosmetic goodies and the Weapon Pack with three fancy new guns.

You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of One Piece and enjoy a dip into the world of Mobile gaming, you’ve likely heard of One Piece: Bounty Rush. The 4 vs. 4 PvP capture the flag game is incredibly fun to play, has a gacha element, and bizarrely compelling. 


However, in my time with it the one place it fell flat was the clunky touchscreen controls. Maybe this is a me problem, but I’ve never quite been able to fully enjoy a game when using a touchscreen to control movement or attacks. This will soon be an issue of the past where Bounty Rush is concerned as Bandai Namco has revealed that One Piece: Bounty Rush is coming to Steam in Fall 2024.




In One Piece: Bounty Rush, you gain new characters from a huge roster of 200 possibly obtainable characters through the gacha system. Then, you use these characters in 4 vs. 4 Capture the Flag battles to win upgrade materials, currencies, and, let's face it, bragging rights. 


Transferring this touchscreen mobile game to larger screens is already a huge step in what I feel is the right direction, but the ability to play with WASD controls or even a controller (hopefully) will only give what is a truly fun game a new lease of life.

Originally released for mobile platforms back in 2018, Bounty Rush has more than 10 million downloads through the Google Play Store alone, and reviews are largely favorable. There are regular events held, including the current 5.5 Year Thank You Campaign, and you’re never short of new things to do. 


There is currently no word as to whether progress made on mobile platforms will carry over to the Steam version of Bounty Rush, although even if you need to start over, you’ll have a world of fun clawing your way back up the league tables and kicking butt in battles against other players.

However, as with many Roblox games, Realm Rampage isn't a title you can pick up and be a master at within just a few minutes. It takes time to learn how to play each character and figure out how their movesets work so you can be as efficient as possible when beating other players to a pulp. Mercifully, there is a place that can help you with this, a place where you can also hook up with the community and learn things you may never have figured out were possible by going it alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is a new action-RPG that should appeal to those who are keen on Souls-like games, particularly Sekiro. In fact, it looks as though plenty of people have already got a taste for it, as the numbers show Game Science's new release is really blowing up on Steam.


Despite only coming out today, Black Myth is boasting some staggering numbers on SteamDB. At the time of writing, the game has registered 2,151,942 players within the last few moments, and it's going up all the time. That's to say nothing of the PS5 figures.




To put that into perspective, Elden Rings's peak concurrent player count on PC was 953,426 about two and a half years ago. Even more mind-blowing, it's beaten this year's smash hit Palworld, which, at its highest, registered 2,101,867 concurrent players, according to SteamDB.


Woah-kong!


God I love a pun. Anyway, over two million players within hours of release means Black Myth is currently the second-most played game on Steam. The only thing that's ahead of it is PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, which had a record of 3,257,248 players over six years ago. Counter-Strike 2 looks like small fries compared to these numbers.


Given what we're currently seeing – seriously, Wukong's concurrent player count keeps going up literally as I'm writing this – it's almost certain that the game is going to smash PUBG's figures. By the time this gets published on the site, that may already have happened.


For something that, to some, appears to have come out of nowhere, Black Myth: Wukong is easily going to be the talk of the town. Its gorgeous visuals and lean toward Chinese mythology are evidently things that have tickled a lot of people's fancies.

The controller connects to a wireless DB9 adapter, which means it also works with Atari 2600+ and even original hardware (and possibly other platforms that use DB9, such as the Commodore 64 and Sega Master System, but this isn’t confirmed). There were only 59 games released during the console’s original lifespan, and it isn’t nearly as ubiqui…]]></summary>

Where to get Luojia Fragrant Vine in Black Myth: Wukong


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can find your first piece of Luojia Fragrant Vine just after defeating the evil sorcerer Guangmou. You will come to a shrine called the Marsh of White Mist, where you will find the first piece of vine hanging off a tree to the left. It will be growing from a tree in the corner behind an old stone statue. Interact with it to pull it down and add it to your inventory.


The reason you will need Luojia Fragrant Vine is that it is used to upgrade your healing Gourd, allowing you to take more sips from the vessel before it is empty. You can then bring t…]]></summary>

How to open the purple prison cells in the Pagoda in Black Myth: Wukong


To open the purple doors you will need to find and defeat Captain Lotus Vision, a secret boss hidden away in the level. When you do, you will be able to absorb his spirit, and the doors will open. This will allow you to get in and talk to the NPC at the start, as well as check all the locked rooms in the Pagoda to see what is inside.


To find Captain Lotus Vision, make your way through the Pagoda, climbing from level to level until you reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine. It is worth being quite thorough as you go…]]></summary>

We've been waiting for news of Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh on Switch for a while now (ever since it was first teased back in 2022, to be precise), but it looks like we won't have to wait too much longer. Publishers Tintinimaginatio and Microids have finally revealed that the detective's latest adventure will be flying over to Switch on 17th October 2024.
The game launched on PlayStation and Xbox last year in a pretty sorry state (one that developer Pendulo Studios apologised for on release day), though the announcement of the Switch release comes with a glimmer of hope.

The patch notes for this update are short and concise. Among the most impactful changes is a fix for the explosions caused by the Impaler's tentacles, which have been causing Helldivers 2 players to be thrown 100 meters into the sky of whatever world they're on and furiously ragdoll before crashing back down and dying. The last update made flamethrowers far less effective, but this one fixes the particles that didn't affect enemies alongside allowing all players to detonate mines when enemies get close to them with their …]]></summary>

Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

Can you free the horse man at the Village in Black Myth: Wukong


When you arrive at the Sandgate Village and finally make your way inside (I'd suggest going around to the right, as it's a bit easier, and then you get to ambush the guards at the gate), you will find a familiar face. The horseman whom you met in Black Wind Mountain is in there, and he is a bit of a pickle.


The rats have tied him to a pillar, and it would appear they plan on turning him into dinner for their master. If you are wondering if there is anything you can do to help the horseman out, there does not seem to be. He is content with the idea that he can get himself out of that mess and seems more worried about your safety than his own.


All you can really do is explore the area. There are some chests and a boss to fight, and if you open the gate, you can ambush the guards and get yourself a nice Spirit for your trouble.


Story spoilers ahead


The Horse Guai will show up in other locations throughout the game, and his real name is Ma Tianba. I want to try and help you find this chap in each chapter without actually ruining too much, so you can find some brief locations below.



Chapter 1 - Found just after the fight against the wolf demon Lingxuzi in a small shrine.


Chapter 2 - Sandgate Village, tied to a pole


Chapter 3 - Can be found in the New Thunderclap Temple


Chapter 4 - After the Centipede boss, you can find him all bundled up in a cocoon.


Chapter 5 - Can be found near the Misty Cloud fight.

Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living".
Kiki’s Delivery Service is a movie all about growing up. The night Kiki leaves home to complete a year of witch training, she excitedly overstuffs her bag, makes herself a broomstick that’s too small for her, and crashes into a couple of trees during her flight. She doesn’t have a speciality or skill, and upon arriving in the town of Koriko, she causes a ruckus by stopping traffic. Yet this all serves to set up Kiki’s growth, and the pain of becoming an adolescent and – eventually – an adult. She finds her place in the world, living above a bakery, delivering goods on her broomstick, and overcomes her fears to become the best version of herself.
Kiki is the heart of Studio Ghibli’s 1989 coming-of-age story, and it’s her brashness, positivity, and determination that has clearly rubbed off on Mika, the star of Chibig’s latest game, Mika and the Witch’s Mountain. There’s no greater influence here than the aforementioned movie; the premise of playing a witch delivery game with cel-shaded visuals and sprawling seas inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was enough to smash through its Kickstarter goal. Yet, two years after the potion was brewed, we’re left with a game that has flashes of the heart of the Studio Ghibli classic, but is sadly completely forgettable in almost every single respect.

You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

PQube & Octeto Studios have revealed the release date for Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire, an intriguing Skies of Arcadia-inspired RPG in which players partake in aerial combat controlled via classic turn-based gameplay.
Launching for the Nintendo Switch on 10th October 2024, there's a demo available via Steam right now if you want to get a taste of the action ahead of its release. The general gist of the story, however, is that you take control of captain Glenn Windwalker who must recruit and manage a group of rag-tag pirates. You'll be able to explore various locations on foot, but the real meat of the gameplay takes place in the skies.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

Though I did visit a cat cafe recently, and I got to boop some sphinx kittens on the nose. Life pretty much peaked then, so I'm in a bit of a slump right now.

A joint filing this week reveals that the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice, never to see the light of day again.

We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The FBI veteran revealed the closure of AnytimeTV plus other pirate brands, and a settlement with three operators worth over $2m. After appearing to disregard the importance of security, shutting down now may have helped to avoid a larger bill, further down the road.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any gags I could make about an update that lets Total War: Warhammer 3’s dawi play tall are far too obvious for the discerning comedic palette that brought you such bangers as that time I just wrote “(penis)” a bunch so the Overkill’s Walking Dead page wouldn’t quote me out of context, so let’s just dive right in to the details. The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mountain biking of Lonely Mountains: Downhill was sometimes a relaxing ride down gentle slopes, and at other times a hairy hurtle down declivitous cliffs. Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week there was some minor Discourse about the removal of the Erotica photography tag from the Dead Rising remaster. Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was all set to plunge into Blackbird and Gearbox's Homeworld 3 this spring when I received a slightly underwhelmed intergalactic transmission from Nic, praising the game's atmosphere and story while ruminating over fussy controls and a want of tactical depth. Like a herd of frigates scenting a pride of destroyers lurking behind a nearby asteroid, I rerouted hastily and took up a holding position approximately one astronomical unit from the Buy button, hoping that the developers might iron out a few of the wrinkles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Crimson Diamond is a proper old-school style puzzle adventure. It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KIBORG: Arena feels like a throwback in several ways that I quite enjoy. It’s a free prologue to the upcoming cyberpunk puncher KIBORG. The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.

Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on Pillars Of Eternity successor Avowed and their ace survival game Grounded, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."

After a recent beta update mentioned adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s inputs, The Verge confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.
“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.
Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.

Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.
Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.
The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.
Unless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.

I’m currently trying to puzzle out what the titular Mother Machine in The Curious Expedition studio Maschinen-Mensch’s upcoming co-op platformer refers to. But, if it’s a reference to forming a parental bond with what the game has saw-me-comingishly named “chaos gremlins”, I'm way ahead of you.
Ah, the press release speaketh! Probably should have read some more before I began exclaiming “Chaos Gremlins!” over and over. Have an announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!
Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.

Those 90s cowards. Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The "Crush Depth" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.

Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with Valve's obstinate silence about it, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.

As presented on the Paris Judicial Court's website, the list of domains amounts to a wall of merged text simply asking to be misinterpreted. Fortunately they're more easily determined in the downloaded order, but that doesn't mean precision blocking won't be needed. Perhaps now more than ever, one mistake could go terribly wrong.

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years."

This week, I’ve been half reading in the garden and half staring in awe at my Kindle’s paperwhite doohickey and it’s ability to stay readable in searing sunbeams. I’m tempted to look up how it works but I don’t want to find out it’s made from the luminous, genetically-engineered husks of the workers that drop dead from dehydration at the fulfilment centers or something. To help distract me with yet more books, it’s Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider writer and Destiny 2 senior narrative designer, Dr. Hazel Monforton! Cheers Hazel! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

The reason the same question still gets asked countless times even today, is simple: the answer, should one even exist, is never true for long, even if we assume it was initially true. So what's the harm in asking?

I know it's the first time I've made you aware of this project, but it's been going on since I moved to Glasgow. So far, Lidl's own brand remains the clear winner, a solid 8 on the taste meter at just 59p. But while writing this, I'm sipping an "Intenso" Arctic Coffee from Morrisons, which is giving the Lidl frontrunners some stiff competition at last, albeit at 145% the cost. Will one true victor emerge? Find out next week! For now, here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

When I pursue Ayo and Dija around the garden, keeping their feet and butts in shot as they belittle each other, it's not because I'm a busybody and a lech. And when I pan to the lighthouse piercing the sunset beyond the security spikes it's not out of any feeling of wonder, or even curiosity about possible escape routes. Please understand: I do not see these people, these objects at all, just the boneless, faceless traces they leave upon my own servitude to the lens.

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.
It looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.

It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing "hail the empire/union" bits as a sign off.
I think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WolfEye's debut game Weird West attempted to pack a little of Dishonored's immersive sim sorcery into a top-down action-RPG. For the studio's next game, co-founders Raphaël Colantonio and Julien Roby are leaning into comparisons with their old endeavours at Arkane more earnestly. The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a "real RPG" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.

Reduced score means I can squeeze in another card for more healing. If I can pull my Tarot card, I'll deal damage with each heal, and I’ve already pulled two scratch cards for yet more quick damage. Now, if I can just pull a Jack, I can plonk down the King Of Space And Time for a brutal finisher. That’ll transfer everything on my side over to my opponent’s, forcing a bust for a nice final chunk of hurt and…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running space sim Elite Dangerous has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.

Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire management sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. Life By You, the simulation life-em-up from Paradox, was canceled in June after being delayed indefinitely. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. He claimed the team spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”
We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, thanks to a thread by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.

Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.
Asda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.
All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Find them proudly emblazoned across the header image above, and written out for easier copy-pasting in the blockquote, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the wait lengthens for Hollow Knight: Silksong, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.
In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to Crusader Kings III is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.
