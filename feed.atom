        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good news! Oh, wait. No. Bad news. Devolver Digital has announced the delay of three games that were slated for 2024. The games are Stick It to the Stickman, Baby Steps, and Skate Story. They’re now all coming in 2025. Maybe.


I feel like patting myself on the back, because when the Devolver Delayed Awards 2024 stream was announced, those are the games I guessed. But then I realized that I guessed them by going into Steam, looking at what games Devolver still has slated for 2024, and listing them off. There was absolutely no guesswork there, so I should probably have a little modesty.


However, I’d like to point out that Stick It to the Stickman and Skate Story are both returning champions from the Devolver Delayed 2023 stream. At this point, they might as well keep delaying them for the shower of accolades it nets them every year.


I don’t really have a horse in this race. I’m rarely disappointed by delays these days because I’ve always got too much to play, both at the present and in the future. And the only game of the three delayed I’m really all that interested in is Skate Story. That’s because I like Skate. and this game is clearly trying to do something neat with the formula. However, it’s not, like, at the top of my priorities. If it’s at the top of your priorities: bummer.


Stick It to the Stickman, Baby Steps, and Skate Story are all set to release sometime in 2025. You can check out the Devolver Delayed stream over here.

You can choose to unlock either one or both cards, and they have the chance of getting upgrades in the future. The upgrade scenario will depend on the result of the upcoming fixture between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.

Ramy Bensebaini

This is the final fodder challenge EA Sports will release as part of the ongoing Pro championships. You don't have to use any high-rated item to complete the challenge, but doing so will earn you a pack and help you wrap up the FC Pro Live Completionist objective set.

EA FC 25 FC Pro Live Challenge 3 SBC solutions


This is one of the easiest fodder challenges, and you should have the cards that are required to complete it. However, you can always resort to buying a few items and use the solution mentioned here.

Hughes CB 70


Gannon CB 62

After completing the challenge, you'll get a Small Prime Mixed Players Pak. This pack isn't that good, and you get 2 Silver, 2 Bronze, and 2 Gold Player items. Any three of the six cards will be Rare, so the potential outcome ain't great. That said, the cost of completing this SBC is extremely low, and you can get the bonus rewards from the Completionist objective. Hence, make sure to complete the challenge as quickly as possible so as not to miss out on any potential packs ahead of Black Friday.

Embarking on the Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops update, you'll find two flashlights in your locker with the Standard Edition. Any edition you purchase provides the Surefire P1R Peacekeeper Flashlights, including extra equipment for better survivability. For a mere $96 (in-game), you can also equip yourself with the versatile NStar Light from the Gunny Vendor.

The latest SBC is pretty similar to the Hero Upgrade SBC we have received in earlier months. This time, however, the stakes are higher, as some of the Icons have incredible valuations in the market. Naturally, the cost of completing the challenge is more. That said, let's first take a look at all the rewards you can possibly get by finishing the SBC. 


All EA FC 25 Max 87 Icon Upgrade SBC rewards


The Max 87 Icon Upgrade SBC features all Icons rated 87 or lower. This is the only negative side of the SBC, but there are still some amazing cards you can end up finding in Ultimate Team by completing the challenge.

How to hotwire a vehicle in Project Zomboid


To hotwire a car, you’ll need to first enter the driver’s seat of the vehicle. You can do this by walking up to the car and pressing the E key. If the vehicle is locked, you’ll need to break a window with a weapon or your elbow to get inside.


Once you’re in the driver’s seat, you’ll see the car’s dashboard. You won’t be able to turn it on without the key, so to hotwire it, open the vehi…]]></summary>

Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making "gaming" earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Popular indie games Palworld and Terraria will have some crossover content next year in Palworld. Very few details have been shared about the tie-in, but we know information will be coming soon.


Palworld Terraria crossover is incoming


Viewed over 1.8 million times on X since the Tuesday announcement, the official Palworld social media account posted a crossover image. It has the Terraria Guy and Palworld's main character shaking hands. Not much else is known other than we're getting information "coming soon." 


Palworld also says that there will be at least one more update before the end of the year. This time, it says news about the next update will be coming "very soon." 




Terraria is no stranger to crossovers. Don't Starve Together has the Eye of Terror, new bosses, and a bunch of new skins inspired by Terraria, while Terraria received one new boss and plenty of items based on the Klei property. Terraria also received Stardew Valley-based content, such as the Blue Chicken and Stardrop, while Stardew Valley implemented the Meowmere sword. 


Based on past history, it's likely we'll see Terraria elements in Palworld, and vice versa. Based on the art, we could see Cattiva, Depresso, and Chillet in the world of Terraria. On the other hand, perhaps some weapons and crafting items could be craftable in Palworld.

This is the first good news for Palworld fans for a while. The game's developer, Pocketpair, has been sued by The Pokémon Company. The plaintiff claims that Pocketpair has infringed on three patents. It's been reported that the Pal Sphere system veers too close to a Pokéball.

The Night Ops update expands this aspect through its new Night and Day cycle, bringing a unique threat in the darkness.


The dangers of the night forces you to use various light materials, specifically with the latest NVG equipment. Here's how to get Night Vision Goggles in Gray Zone Warfare.


How to unlock NVGs in Gray Zone Warfare


Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops offers three versatile night vision device options: PVS-7, PVS-14, and PVS 31A. The vendor, Handshake, sells the PVS-7 for $5,218, which makes for an excellent starter NVG.

While later generations have only become more advanced and complex as the years have gone by, Sony's second foray into the console market still reigns supreme, even after 20-odd years.


In fact, the PS2 still holds the title of the biggest-selling console of all time. According to Sony, the PlayStation follow-up —which was released in 2000 and recently celebrated its 24th anniversary  —has sold more than 160,000,000 units worldwide.

When we check out the latest UK Charts data each week, we generally have a pretty good idea of where some of the newest titles will end up placing. Granted, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was a little lower than our estimates when it debuted in 14th place last week, but when we scrolled through this week's list and found it had disappeared entirely, well, we frankly couldn't believe it.
Alas, it's true. The exceptional RPG remake from Square Enix has crashed out of the top 40 altogether, marking a stark difference between audiences' tastes in the UK when compared to Japan. We knew it would never do gangbusters, of course – Dragon Quest never really does well in the UK – but goodness, this is absurd. At least its performance over in Japan will likely be enough to keep Squeenix satisfied for now.

Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.

Hamster Corporation has revealed this week's addition to the Arcade Archives, and it's none other than Success' first broom-based shoot 'em up, Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams.
The Switch has seen its fair share of Cotton titles since Reboot! landed on the hybrid back in 2021. In the years since, we have snatched up Cotton 100%, Panorama, Guardian Force Saturn Tribute, Fantasy, Rainbow Cotton and a host of others. In short, this Arcade Archives release will be adding to one heck of a collection.

Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

Here are the most popular and useful Blue Lock Rivals community channels:



Official Blue Lock Rivals Trello Board


Blue Lock Rivals Discord Server


BLR Roblox Community Page



Unlike other Roblox RPGs, BLR takes the idea of races and classes and turns them into soccer styles and flows based on characters from the show. You should also check out a full list of Blue Lock Rivals codes to claim free goodies. You can find information on all of these on the community Trello board, in addition to:



What the game is and how it’s played


Other useful links


Keybinds


Gamemodes


All Styles


All Flows


Emotes


Cards


Goal Effects


Techniques


Codes


Gamepasses



I would check out the percentages to roll all styles and flows first. That way, you can gauge whether you should reroll. That said, Discord is also a great source of information on the game, but from a more social side. You can ask other experienced players there for tips or how certain mechanics work. It’s a great place to check with others what strategies work and what to avoid.


The Blue Lock Rivals Discord is also where you can track news, updates, and announcements for the game. I like checking back often for patch notes to see what was nerfed, buffed, or added. Also, you can find more codes here for free goodies in addition to any giveaways. Check back for giveaways and other prizes often.


And that’s how to find the Blue Lock Rivals Trello and Discord. Check out our other BLR guides right here on Destructoid.

Back in September, Koei Tecmo announced another Atelier game for Switch. We still don't have a precise release date for the catchily-titled (deep breath) Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist & the White Guardian, but we do know that it'll be launching at some point in 2025. Other details are slim, but Koei Tecmo has shed a little more light on the upcoming project in a recent tweet.
Let's get the biggie out of the way first: Atelier Resleriana will not include a gacha system. The game's mobile predecessor, Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator, was guilty of relying perhaps a little too heavily on pull rates and paid-only options, so it's nice to hear that we'll see no such systems in the console spin-off.

Given the sheer magnitude of Animal Crossing's popularity (New Horizons is currently sitting pretty at 46.45 million units sold on Switch), it's no surprise that other companies will want to take a peek at Nintendo's homework and conjure up something similar.
The latest effort is seemingly cooking away within the walls of Ubisoft, as a new report from Insider Gaming suggests that the company is hard at work on a new social-sim project by the codename of 'Alterra'. It's said to be inspired by Animal Crossing while utilising a voxel-based visual setup (think The Touryst and you'll be on the right track).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bazaar's closed beta is already receiving praise from the gaming community, and it could be an exciting addition to the world of digital card games.


That said, the closed beta has its share of issues that can prevent you from enjoying the gameplay. It's one of those titles that require a persistent internet connection, and there have been instances where players have been unable to connect to the server. Let's take a look at how you might be able to fix the situation if such troubles occur.


How to fix the "Unable to connect to the server" error in The Bazaar


If you see this message pop up, it means that the client is being unable to connect to the server. Till the situation is fixed, you won't be able to enjoy any bit of the gameplay. Here are a few steps you can take to solve the problem from your end potentially. But first, make sure to check the server status.


You can do so by following the game's X handle or by joining the official Discord. If the servers are down for some reason, chances are that you can find the relevant information here. While the servers are down, there's not much that you can do apart from bidding your time.




When I get the error (which appears to be random), I usually restart the game. I am unsure why restarting your client fixes the issue, but it appears to be the best solution. Of course, this should be done only when you're sure that the servers are operational. Doing this while there's maintenance going on isn't going to fix anything at all.


That said, The Bazaar's servers are reasonably stable, and there aren't too many bugs that will spoil your experience. However, it's still a beta, so expect to encounter bugs and glitches occasionally. The game can be bought directly from the game's website, and becoming an early founder will have certain advantages in the long run.

Game controls


FAQ


Daily rewards


All races


All factions


All quests


NPCs


Armors


Accessories


Gamepasses



Lastly, you can also find the latest Arcane Seas codes here under the Game Information section. I would also recommend joining the Discord channel. While Trello has a lot of information on content, Discord is where you can get opinions from the community itself. You can search for specific questions you might have or just chat with other players about the latest updates.


Speaking of which, the Discord and the Roblox Community hub are where you can track announcements on the latest patches. I also like reviewing patch notes here and seeing what got buffed or nerfed to adjust to the meta of the game. With all the different classes, races, and special abilities, it pays to be updated on what to focus on.


And that’s how you find the Arcane Seas Trello board and Discord server. Stay tuned to Destructoid for more Arcane Seas guides.

        <updated>2024-11-26T23:07:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stalker 2 has its fair share of unique weapons that you can unlock, and the Trophy rifle is certainly one that can easily remain hidden throughout your entire save.


Typically, you can unlock extra weapons if you've purchased the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition. These weapons can be found in different Journalist Stashes, and you'll get them gradually. That said, the Trophy gun is available even if you've purchased the Standard Edition. 


As I said, finding it can be a bit tricky, and there are high chances that you might have gone past the place without knowing that there's a secret gun for you to discover.


How to get the Trophy gun in Stalker 2


To find this weapon, you'll have to play a bit to unlock the Chemical Plant region. This place has plenty of POIs, including the Army Warehouses, which itself has some great resources. If you've purchased the Ultimate Edition of the game, you can also find the Lullaby assault rifle from this spot. To get the Trophy gun, you'll have to travel west from where the Army Warehouses location. To simplify matters, I have marked the location on the screenshot below.


Image via Destructoid


Once you reach the spot, you'll notice a broken structure. I am not sure what exactly it is (it looks like a broken incubator), and you'll find a corpse lying in front of it. If you look carefully on the map, you'll find two other structures located close to this spot. All three structures are actually connected, and all you have to do is throw a grenade through the opening of the structure (the one with the corpse).




Just wait, and there will be three explosions. The third explosion will open a structure similar to the one where you threw the grenade. Once cracked open, you'll find a stash waiting for you to be unlocked. This stash contains the Trophy gun (an assault rifle, rather) and a bunch of useful items like ammo, consumables, and grenades.

Where to get Simple Fertilizer in Towers of Aghasba


Unlike many items necessary for crafting in Towers of Aghasba, Simple Fertilizer cannot be found by simply picking it up off the ground. It has to be made in-house at a Compost Shed, and you have to be one to do it. Firstly, you're going to need to build a Compost Shed in your village on Amani Island. This is the tutorial island and the location where you start the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sublime Switch combat.
Scroll through the eShop any week, and under the new releases section, you are bound to find a Metroidvania, if not several. The genre is packed with so many games that few manage to break out. However, Red Candle Games' Nine Sols did manage to make a name for itself earlier this year on PC, and now that it has come to Switch, it is clear to see why.
It fuses the intense, precise parrying system seen in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice with satisfying skills, abilities, and upgrades that are all accentuated by strong sound design and visuals. While the worldbuilding and design didn't particularly grab us, its combat is enough to make it stand out when compared to its 2024 Metroidvania competition.

The My Nintendo loyalty program is pretty good, right? If you head on over to the rewards section of the service right now, you’ll find a host of interesting goodies to claim should you possess the required number of coins. These include a Nintendo Switch Online 2025 Calendar, a set of Super Mario Bros. embossed art prints, a Mario vs. Donkey Kong smartphone ring, and a Mario & Luigi: Brothership pin set. That’s… good, isn’t it?
Yes, it’s good, but it’s not great. And by gum, if you’ve been a fan of Nintendo for a while now, then you’ll know that My Nintendo’s predecessor, Club Nintendo, was often great. In operation from 2002 (region-depending) until 2015, Club Nintendo offered up some of the most incredible, one-of-a-kind products imaginable. A golden Twilight Princess statue, a SNES controller for the Wii, a Year of Luigi coin, multiple CD soundtracks... It really felt like the sky was the limit for Club Nintendo, and we’re saddened that My Nintendo will likely never match its brilliance.

Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io's Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.
Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside "existential grey" is Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION, from New York City-based game designer Hatim Benhsain. It's a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.

Everyone's favourite pink puffball, Kirby, is teaming up with Heinz (you know, the tomato ketchup guys) for a new range of sauces in Japan. Well, that's not a sentence we thought we'd be writing today, but we can't say we're surprised.
Shared by the official Heinz Twitter account, the Kirby range will be launching in late November with nine designs adorning the front of the packets. There's even Balsamic and Sriracha flavour options for those who like their chips with a bit of a kick.

The toughest April Fools' jokes to swallow are the ones that genuinely get our hopes up, only for it all to come crashing down when reality sets in. April Fools’ Day 2024 saw plenty of enticing fake announcements, but there was one smaller prank nestled among the big hitters that stung just a little bit extra. Developer Inti Creates, known for games like Blaster Master Zero and Azure Striker Gunvolt, took to social media that fateful day to unveil Divine Dynamo Flamefrit: an all-new, top-down, action-adventure, dungeon-crawler game.
Suffice it to say, it left quite the strong impression with its stylish 16-bit graphics, its flashy combat, and, most importantly, its utter devotion to replicating the cheesy aesthetic of '80s and '90s-era shonen anime. While the trailer was clearly marked as an April Fools’ Day joke, that didn’t stop fans from letting Inti Creates know that this was a game they wanted to actually play. Fortunately, the developer made it happen. Once just an intricately crafted joke, Divine Dynamo Flamefrit is now out in a fully playable form — and it’s quite the enjoyable little romp.

I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

Cornut states "I want to make games differently" and that he "didn't want to be swimming against the tide", prompting him to leave Lizardcube in the capable hands of Fiquet and the rest of the team.

We knew this end date was on the horizon and we told ourselves that it would all be okay with Pocket Camp Complete landing on mobile next month. And yet here we are, having a little cry over a new in-game event called the 'Thank-You Finale'.
You see, unlike Nintendo's other apps, where service has ended with little to no fanfare, Pocket Camp's 'Thank-You Finale' is all about saying goodbye to the camp you have been building over the last seven years.

Yet it’s usually been just a few tenners too expensive for me to say "You, RPS reader, buy this", and since telling people what to buy is around 40% of this job, well, that just leaves a peripheral-shaped hole in my heart.

"I won’t", I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The enemies of survival shooter Stalker 2 have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

Don't Wake The Beast is sort of that sequence plus Spelunkified procgen levels and Thief-esque stealth mechanics.

Here’s some more delicious bait for you, then. Mossflower TW is a campaign mod for Medieval II: Total War expansion Kingdoms that lets ranks of mace-wielding mice, helmeted hedgehogs, and ornery otters skitter wildly all over the venerable strategy game. It’s been about since Summer, and the team have been working on patching since. It seems very playable, if the footage of people playing it is anything to go by.

Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.

There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws' stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it's rubbish, some others think it's basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing".

Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have significant reservations about Avowed, Obsidian's first-person Pillars Of Eternity spin-off RPG, but those reservations are significantly offset by the fact that I can be an undersea mushroom woman called Mystic Meg. In Avowed, you are the god-touched envoy of a distant emperor, sent to an island realm known as the Living Lands to investigate a mysterious blight. "God-touched", in this case, means "fungal and a bit mermaidy". It means that you can make rainbow toadstools sprout from your eyesocket in the character creator. It means that you can accessorise your cheekbones with what look like bracket polypores, or deck your ears with staghorn coral.

All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did last week's paranormal body-swapper Slitterhead leave you cold? Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you'll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you're a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re probably all past "And in the game" jokes by now, but it is fitting that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl is about venturing into a shattered world and enduring the worst of its logic-defying hardships to find the treasures within. This is a bold, uncompromising survival FPS that can easily capture you for days on end – but I can’t invite you back into the Zone without hammering in a few hundred warning signs reading "DANGER: BUGS". In Ukrainian, obviously.

Dark Math Games followed around lunchtime - they’re making a sexy Antarctic ski resort mystery called XXX Nightshift. Finally, there was Summer Eternal, the mouthiest and Marxiest of the lot, who have set themselves up as a workers co-operative and have yet to announce a specific project.

The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved 'pirate' set-top devices from functioning in people's homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, "there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use," the hacker predicted.

Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: "I hope this hurts."

One of these is Bloodshed, an old school FPS take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase "just one more run".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I've never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot 'em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: "ah, that was good."
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern.

Sony are in talks to buy Kadokawa, the parent company of Elden Ring developer From Software. Sony is eyeing up the company as a hefty snack because they want the various manga and anime owned by Kadokawa, according to a report by Reuters. But also because they want all the tasty games owned by them too, such as the Danganronpa series, the Octopath Traveler games, and the biggest corn flake of them all, the Dark Souls series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It takes a special kind of entitled bellyacher to complain that you wanted a different game from a game that hasn't even been announced yet, and which may simply be an internet rumour. It's like the "glass half empty" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the "bar", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. "A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please," I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

        <updated>2024-11-18T15:45:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha "prelude": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of "hateful or extremist" language and images hosted on Steam's community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve "bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards" or risk "intense scrutiny" from the government.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně "zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trend has emerged on YouTube where 'scammy' channels facing a ban for copyright infringement appear to evade penalties through the use of sexually explicit content. Questions remain, but evidence does suggest that a loophole is being exploited. By avoiding termination for copyright infringement, these channel owners may be able to protect their linked AdSense accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will spend this Sunday nursing a chest infection, probably by wrapping blankets around myself and watching YouTube videos until sleep comes. Let's first round up some good links with writing and videos about videogames.

This is surely the best link this week: an hour-long video on how to beat "every possible game of Pokemon Platinum at the same time". That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously. It's an impressive feat, but the video itself is great too, patiently breaking down the process with motion graphics and video editing flair. Delightful.

It was also complaint-provoking in the fairly long period where I didn't understand what it's trying to do. Reaching that point, luckily for you, means we can cut out a lot of the "confused whingeing" subsection of those notes. Though it still has its shortcomings, I've come to appreciate that I was reading Kingdoms all wrong. Although it talks big about characters, politics, and religion, they're not what it's about. It's about building.

It's part of a "restructuring" that'll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in a press release yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it's an intentional move that'll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been 'out' of strategy autobattler Mechabellum since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back in September. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as "a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry We're Closed is a retro survival horror-inspired game about escaping the clutches of an excessively horny demon who desperately wants your heart. As someone who isn't often into the 'lore' behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say "lol, it me" with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter "ugh, it me" and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap "should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it." But do you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, game retailers GOG have drifted from almost purely offering classic oldies to welcoming more and more modern blockbusters onto their storefront. In one sense, they've turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you'll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Theme park management sim Planet Coaster was all about making roller coasters that would push your park guests to the edge of puking up their overpriced burgers while making sure the excitement levels of your twisting rides remained high. Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I've found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake's premise is bluntly, delightfully simple. The Archfiend Baramos, as evil as he is mysterious, is up and about. He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the strategy of Sultan’s Game for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its Steam demo - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been "you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?", because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as "co-developers" on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

"I didn’t even know what a Neo-Volkite pistol was until five minutes ago, but now this whole game is trash until I get one!." As promised in the roadmap, the last big update added a whole new Operations map, complete with a gargantuan new pseudo-boss in the form of a hierophant bio-titan. It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nevím, co je "legálně" zapotřebí k tomu, aby se mohl film nazývat "dokumentem", ale tohle působí jako zcela standardní nízkorozpočtový hraný film. Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dokument, který je profesionálně natočen, tzn. má tempo a atmosféru, je přehledný a dobře se na něj dívá. Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.
