        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kastov-74u ban has begun in Modern Warfare II
It always takes a few weeks to adjust after a new Call of Duty game comes out (or any online multiplayer game, really), including server issues, any outstanding bugs, and of course, balancing out any mechanics that might give players an advantage over others. Apparently, that's exactly the case with the Kastov-74u, which has been banned in pro tournaments lately. The gun is based on the real world AK-47 submachine gun, but in Modern Warfare II, it's actually classified as an assault rifle.
Basically, the Kastov-74u rips through enemies at close range like a submachine gun, but also does well at mid-range, which makes it more akin to an assault rifle. While it's not unheard of for players to get creative with their loadouts and use guns for plays that they weren't originally intended for (close range quick-scoping with a sniper rifle being the most famous example of this), but the Kastov is missing the balance that makes for a fair fight, according to the pro players.

The bans started rolling in only three days after the professional season started in the first place -- if there's one thing we can always rely on, it's pro gamers optimizing a game in the shortest amount of time possible. As a casual Call of Duty player, it never ceases me to see how players can suss out the most powerful builds on what seems like intuition to me, but then again I guess that's why they're professionals at this.
In wake of the bans, streamer and pro Call of Duty player Swagg shared his favorite Kastov-74u loadout, which features the BR209 Barrel, Merc Foregrip Underbarrel, and the True-Tac Grip Rear Grip. It's a simple build, featuring only three out of a possible five attachments, but apparently adding too many of the Modern Warfare II attachments can hinder you more than they help you in some cases.

The studio behind the games, Focus Entertainment, has announced via Twitter that A Plague Tale: Requiem has surpassed 1 million players, which is always an impressive milestone for an indie game.

The whole time I was playing, I couldn't stop thinking about how awesome I thought the first game was, to the point that it is one of my favorite games of all time.

While Marvel Snap is quickly taking over phones, one particular feature that's missing is the ability to challenge friends. But that's going to change soon, as the team says a mode for playing against friends in Marvel Snap is arriving before the end of the year.
Speaking to The Washington Post, a spokesperson for developer Second Dinner confirms an update is on the way for this calendar year. Part of this update will be a "friend-centric" Battle Mode.
The Battle Mode was mentioned in an October roadmap update, as a different way of playin Snap. Rather than competing for Cosmic Cubes, player have health.
Multiple matches are played out and players lose health like Cubes, with Snaps taking more health. This is a bit different from the current one-and-done ladder climbing mode.

Snap back
This is an interesting way of playing, and one I'm pretty interested in seeing. As much as I love the current version of Marvel Snap, the concept of playing out multiple matches and adapting to the opponent is a cool concept.
Obviously, using health rather than Cosmic Cube progression, means you can have a little bit of fun with it too. Maybe rather than worrying about certain decks or strats, you can just instant-Snap and roll out your gimmick decks.
Marvel Snap has surged its way into the conversation in a serious way. Understandably so, as it's a seriously fun card game. It's nice to see the team at Second Dinner is still working at ways to keep things fresh, even as players are still working their way through card unlocks and the seasonal pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”]]></summary>

Developer Treyarch has confirmed that its recently released blockbuster shooter Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II will not be receiving Ranked Play anytime soon, with the Seriouz Biznezz mode tabled to arrive in-game sometime in 2023.
While Modern Warfare II's many multiplayer modes are already up and running, the league-based ranked version remains in development at the studio, with the company still beavering away on features such as leaderboards, competitive rewards, distinct skill divisions, and exclusive ranked modes. Aside from "2023", an expected arrival time was not announced.
https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1587848321405980673?s=20&t=9lnlYBv3u1X06JUEVGYNoQ
Posting on Twitter, Treyarch also confirmed that it was to start sunsetting League Play modes for previous entries Call of Duty: Vanguard and Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War. Anyone looking to bag their last remaining ranked rewards for those titles needs to lock 'n' load, as the games' respective ranking will be shutting down on November 22. Of course, both titles will remain available to play online, (which is good as, incredibly, I'm still playing Black Ops Cold War on occasion.)
While the delay in ranked play for Modern Warfare II is not ideal, it will likely not make a dent in the shooter sequel's incredible success. The new sequel is the biggest release in the CoD franchise's storied history, having pulled in over $800 million USD in its opening weekend while simultaneously smashing all concurrent player records for the franchise on Steam. Ranked Mode might still be some way away, but the community seems far too engaged in rat-a-tat-tat action right now to pay it much mind.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with "H" and both their last names start with "K."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to thee Hotel Bar-ce-lona...
Further fuel has been added to the rumor fire concerning Suda51, Swery65, and an as-yet-unannounced horror project allegedly involving both — As whispers persist that the developers may be joining forces for a grim new video game, some newly-filed trademarks add further possibility to the supposed project.
As spotted by VGC, White Owls, (the studio helmed by Hidetaka “Swery 65” Suehiro), recently secured international trademarks for both "Hotel Barcelona" and "Death Game Hotel". Both terms had been previously secured for use in Japan back in March of this year, and while all has been quiet in regard to any such game, these new, international filings would suggest that the project is still at the forefront of the developers' minds.
"Hotel Barcelona" is, seemingly, a placeholder name for a project that Goichi "Suda51" Suda has wanted to develop alongside Swery65 for some time. The project was initially referenced during an IGN live stream back in 2019, where it came across as an improvised, pie-in-the-sky idea. Since then, however, various clues have pointed to the possibility that the game is, in fact, in development. Just last week, for example, a behind-the-scenes video shot at Suda's Grasshopper Manufacturer studio showed an artist working on some grotesque monsters.
Regardless, both developers remain tight-lipped as to what Hotel Barcelona is, whether it is definitely in the works, or when we'll be hearing more about it. It's a tantalizing prospect, at any rate. We shall see.
New trademarks have been filed for the horror game from Suda51 and Swery65 [VGC]

N64 avatars are rolling out to Switch Online + Expansion Pack members, according to a tweet from Nintendo this week.
Here are the N64 avatars that will be rolling out starting now:
Super Mario 64
Kirby 64
Zelda: Majora's Mask
Nintendo 64 (hardware)
As of today, the rotation includes all of the above games in some capacity (though the hardware selection only involves three total images), so grab them while you can. These will be updated on a weekly basis according to the tweet, running through December 6: when the promotion ends. You can get them from the Switch Online app at the very bottom of your home screen, but you'll need to play for them with Platinum Points (all of them so far are 10 points each).
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
This week features a bonus array of points for playing Super Mario 64, Kirby 64, and Zelda: Majora's Mask on the N64 app: they'll grant you 100 Platinum Points each. The SNES bonus game is Panel de Pon, which is running in tandem with the 64 promos. Since the icon is in Japanese, look for this photo on the SNES home screen.

A new Day of the Devs showcase airs today, celebrating the event's 10th anniversary. There were also a ton of indie titles shown off, creating an interesting spread of genres, styles, and creators.
Indie spotlights are always useful tools for discovering the next hidden gem to add to your Steam wishlist. And Day of the Devs has traditionally been pretty good at finding some really exciting new titles.
Impressive art styles, retro throwbacks, and yes, something about playing poker on a boat with animals. It was a great spotlight of some projects in development. Here's the full rundown from today's show.

What better way to unwind after a long day at work, school, or wherever than throwing yourself into some intense hack-and-slash action? Or, better yet, why not take the action with you?
Well, thank goodness for the Switch, which has become a quiet little home for some of the best action games of the generation. From classics from the PlayStation 2 era to being the home of the Umbra Witch herself, the Switch lets you sink your teeth into some tough-as-nails action games that combine different mechanics, enemies, and visual styles to create enthralling, palm-sweating experiences. These aren't action-RPGs — RPGs that contain hack-and-slash combat such as NieR: Automata — and we have a handy list for the best action-RPGs on Switch too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It goes over basically everything
A Pokemon Scarlet and Violet recap video just launched on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account; and spans five minutes of general footage that showcases pretty much every major element of the game.
Although the voiceover is in Japanese, you're getting a ton of footage either way, and the gist is easily communicated.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet feature recap:
The clip starts with an overview of some of the key members of the game, as well as another close-up look at the starter trio
We then move into the two legendary Pokemon, who also serve as your motorcycle/mount, which can drive up mountains and fly
The recap transitions into multiplayer, showing off how multiple people can join your game (but only for a brief moment)
Then we get another look at the three "core" storylines: which you can tackle in any order (as a reminder, it's Victory Road [trainer battles], Path of Legends [an explorer-themed questline], and Starfall Street [the antagonistic faction similar to Team Rocket]
There's a short montage of new creatures
The video then shifts into the Terastallize mechanic, as well as raids with multiple trainers/players
The ability to take photos wasn't widely shown off before today, so if you're interested in the more chill/social elements, tune in around 4:30 for some extra footage
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are due on November 18, and will continue the "dual" release model following Pokemon Legends' single release. I'm mostly on board, but I hope that the "open world" truly is open, and has a lot to do.

Sega veteran Rieko Kodama, who has been a key figure in the concept and visual design of so many of the studio's iconic franchises, passed away on May 9, 2022. She was 58.
While Kodama's passing happened during the spring of this year, details of her death were not widely reported out of respect for Kodama and for the privacy of her family. The sad news became widespread after a memorial message was discovered in the credits of the recently released Sega Mega Drive Mini II console.
Born in 1963 in Yokosuka, Japan, Kodama devoted her scholarly years to a combined interest in art and design, as well as archaeology, particularly fascinated by the mysteries of Ancient Egypt. As she progressed through school, Kodama found herself drawn to graphic design and the visual arts — taking …]]></summary>

Unfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he's got to face a day stuck inside his grandma's house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My boy was just like me
I typically start off some AAA sequel reviews waxing poetic about how "there isn't much to say that wasn't already said" about an original. But in the case of 2018's God of War, there really is!
It's fascinating that the team kept the original continuity, but drastically changed the formula, and let Kratos grow as a character and a father. The pointed focus on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus helped make the 2018 iteration intimate and relatable. The sequel, God of War Ragnarok, mostly rolls with that premise, but it also tries to juggle a ton of extra cast members as it weaves in more stories.

Publisher Nacon has announced that the long-gestating Blood Bowl 3 will finally launch on February 23rd, 2023. There's a catch, though... This doesn't include the Switch.
Yes, as seems to be the norm with a growing chunk of third-party titles, the Switch version of Blood Bowl 3 won't be included in the big February launch, but will instead arrive at a later date. When, exactly..? We don't know. Could be mere weeks after, or we could be looking at several months at this stage.

We talk about the characters that we relate to most, and also I find a way to mention Saturnalia again. Tune in next week to see if I can keep up my streak!
Matthew being away this week means that Nate takes on the role of the anti-Matthew, and we speculate about which games we think Matthew would probably find relatable. For myself and Nate the themes include sadness and drudgery. But there's good news, because Nate has remembered to make me a Cavern Of Lies this week! Hooray!

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…]]></summary>

It's wild seeing the disparity between how big some series seem, and how big they really are. Metroid is one that comes to mind. While the Mega Man series is mighty in terms of raw number of games, it doesn't always lead to mega sales. Mega Man 11 however, can be considered a success by nearly any metric. Especially after learning that it's taken the top spot overall in terms of overall sales. "Best-selling Mega Man 11" has kind of a ring to it, especially given the circumstances behind its release, and how it effortlessly swooped in and crushed Mighty No. 9.
The data comes directly from Capcom, who updated their sales figures over on their official site (thanks Nintendo Life!). If you scroll quite a ways down, all the way past tons of Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and Dead Rising entries, and even a few Onimusha titles (bring this series back!), you'll see Mega Man 11 at number 67 overall with 1.6 million in sales. That puts it above the previous champion, Mega Man 2, which sports 1.51 million in sales and helped kick off an empire.
So where's Mega Man 12? We can only hope it's in the works at some point, and builds on the foundation of everything Mega Man 11 was; but with feedback and enhancements. I'd love to see a bigger budget rendition of Mega Man 8: anime cutscenes and all.

As you'll know if you've played either of Blizzard's near-identical hero shooters, Overwatch 2 lets you queue up for a match as a particular hero role, which ensures balanced team compositions but also can mean a wait of several minutes before you get into a match. Cue me scouring my Steam Library a few days ago for a quick little time-waster to fill those gaps. And after a few failed attempts, I discovered it. Or, more accurately, rediscovered it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stand on top The Lands Between
Sneaky-deeky dataminers have uncovered further evidence that brand new PvP multiplayer content could be headed to Bandai Namco's stellar adventure, Elden Ring.
As reported by Eurogamer, Code hunter "Sekiro Dubi" took a deep dive into the Gothic RPG's October update and found references to various unused in-game banners, emblazoned with messages such as "Begin Match", "You Win", "You Lose", and "Draw Game", all of which, obviously, would pertain to some form of refereed sporting conflict.
https://twitter.com/sekirodubi/status/1581410861645590528?s=20&t=EGJCPnbZ2stkMATaDExPuA
Sekiro Dub opines that these messages might eventually be used in conjunction with the currently empty colosseums that can be found dotted around The Lands Between, providing an enclosed throwdown ground for what could be one-on-one, team-based, or gauntlet-based battles. Of course, this currently remains speculation on all of our parts.
More recently, Sekiro Dub found placeholder slots for up to 30 brand new boss characters — (That's "slots for a potential 30 bosses", not "30 bosses are definitely incoming"). Given the incredible success of Elden Ring and its mighty player base, it would hardly be surprising to see Bandai Namco offer up a battleground for some of the title's finest digital warriors and warlords to square off in some form of sporting, league-based, competitive combat.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…]]></summary>

[Update: It turns out that Symbiogenesis is just another drab NFT/blockchain project from Square Enix. It's coming in spring 2023, and we don't know if it is, indeed, related to Parasite Eve at all. But we likely won't be covering it anyway, so who cares?]
Square Enix has filed a trademark for a mysterious new project, which has led some fans to nervously anticipate the return of a classic IP — The Japanese publisher laid claim to the term "Symbiogenesis" earlier this month on October 13, ultimately being granted licensing rights last week.
The term Symbiogenesis is an evolutionary theory that concerns the act of two early-evolving organisms coming together to form a singular entity, that then continues to evolve while taking on the attributes of its two base organisms. I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only last week I was praising games that wanna be weird, and as such I must commend the weirdness of The Chant, a third-person action adventure where a retreat akin to Jared Leto's definitely-not-a-cult finds itself crashing into a weird nightmare realm akin to the Upside Down from Stranger Things. The thing is, if anything I don't think it's weird enough. If you're going to do a game where the main character uses flaming witchhazel sticks to lash energy-crystal monsters with vagina-flower faces, my view is that you go hard or go home.

A rating for a game called 'Ghost Trick' has been spotted in Korea. Made by The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea, the rating was filed on 24th August 2022 and accepted on 2nd September 2022, Gematsu reports.
If you had a DS and loved detective games (or an iOS or Android), then your ears might be burning. This could well be a rating from Capcom's DS cult favourite, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. The publisher on the rating is 'Gamepia', which is the publishing company for Capcom in Korea. Nothing official has been announced yet, and we're trying not to get too excited, but we'd love to see a rerelease of Ghost Trick — especially on Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We will send unto them... only you.".
It’s interesting to look back and see how first-person shooters have evolved since the days of Doom. What once used to be a genre focused more on the single-player experience of exploring levels and killing monsters slowly turned into something more focused on multiplayer experiences. In recent years, it feels like an older-school design philosophy has been cropping up more and more in smaller-scale shooter projects and the latest in this lineage is Prodeus. Developed by Bounding Box Games, a team made up of industry vets and Doom modders, this new 'boomer shooter' does a fantastic job of bringing back retro shooting carnage with some light modern touches.
Much like the genre predecessors, Prodeus is rather light on narrative. The premise places you in the role of a generic space marine on an asteroid that’s acting as the battleground between two warring factions of aliens. Or something like that. It doesn’t really matter; Prodeus is more interested in just pushing a one-man army’s worth of guns into your hands and prompting you to mag-dump everything that moves. Those of you who appreciated the somewhat heightened focus on story in the latest Doom or Wolfenstein reboots may be a bit disappointed here, then, but we promise that the raw thrill of combat will quickly make you forget you cared about who you’re playing as or what you’re fighting against.

Activision Blizzard continues in its efforts to push back against a unionization vote that has taken place within one of its subsidiaries.

Having failed to prevent the Albany team from securing the initial vote right, Activision Blizzard is now asking the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to impound the votes and prevent tabulation. The studio wants the vote validation to be postponed until its previous appeal against the case has been heard.

One of the most enjoyable games of 2022 to play with a group of friends will soon get a lot more enjoyable. Not too long ago, Passion Republic Games announced it had secured a collaboration with the Godzilla brand for its party-brawler GigaBash. Details were scarce at first, but in the early hours of Godzilla Day–which marks the nationwide release of Godzilla/Gojira in 1954–the developers dropped a new teaser trailer giving fans their first look at the GigaBash Godzilla DLC.
He may be shrouded in shadows but that is the big green monster that's been saving and/or destroying cities since the '50s. As I stated in my review, GigaBash already has its own spin on Godzilla with the kaiju Rawa. But I have to imagine getting the big green is certainly a boon for the developers. I mean, he'll certainly make more sense here than he ever did in Warzone. Looking at his silhouette, I can't quite put my finger on which of the many different Godzilla costumes the character is modeled after, but it does seem to be taking cues from the Heisei era of the franchise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Iqm0z5WWk
Obviously, it's a brief look at the big green, but I can't wait for him to join the action. Godzilla stomps his way into GigaBash starting on December 9. [Update: According to a press release, Godzilla will actually be one of four characters that will join the game next month as DLC.]  GigaBash is now available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

That’s when Call Of Duty: Black Ops developers Treyarch will be delivering the military shooter’s ranked play, although there’s no more intel on when exactly we’ll be able to dolphin-dive in. The window for ranked play’s arrival was tweeted by Treyarch alongside some more things to expect from Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer, such as competitive modes, a Top 250 leaderboard, and visible skill ratings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that's always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It's a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland's Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you'll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you're here.
But Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo's Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry's nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you'd hope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And I could not be more excited
Slay the Spire is one of my most-played games of all time, so it's always a pleasant surprise to see the little indie game that could from 2017 in the headlines. This time, there's a Slay the Spire board game in the works, and in all honesty, I'm not much of a board game person, but I am willing to be if it means I get to play a physical version of my favorite deckbuilding roguelike.
Apparently I somehow missed the announcement that Slay the Spire was getting a board game adaptation two years ago, but the Kickstarter page for the project is officially launched. So far they've raised over $1.5 million, and I don't really have any clue how much money it takes to make a board game, but that seems like a pretty substantial chunk of change in my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGfSp3Kz7rk
There are four pledge tiers ranging from $1 to $210 -- the lowest tier gets you access to updates and the Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, the $100 tier gives you the base game, the $145 version gets you the base game plus some extras like character play mats and metal coins, and that fancy $210 version gets you the game and a whole bunch of extras, like the aforementioned mats, coins, and some beta art, among other things.
There are already some reviews of the board game up online, and with all the little bits and baubles (that I am bound to lose) it seems that the mechanics are a very faithful adaptation of what we're used to seeing in the video game. It looks to me like a pretty luxe purchase for collectors and fans of the game, so I'd probably suggest giving the original a few runs before playing if you haven't already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The days keep getting longer
Harvestella arrives on Nintendo Switch and PC this week. And ahead of launch, Square Enix is detailing some updates it made to Harvestella after getting feedback from the demo.
The Harvestella Switch demo went live on the eShop following the September Nintendo Direct. Players had feedback from it, it seems, and Square Enix is making some tune-ups in a day one update for Harvestella.
As the studio outlines in a new blog entry, one major point is longer days. Time seemed to fly by a bit in the Harvestella Switch demo, so this should hopefully make it easier to do a bit more while the sun's up.
Cooldowns for job switching have been sped up, so it's easier to change up in combat. And the Mage class will also strike a bit faster than before. There's also more warning when your character is low on HP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd3U4jQFovk
In one of my favorite notes, Square says fishing is more fun. Specifically, the hit time has been reduced. But I like the general notion of fishing being more entertaining.
The Harvestella day one update has also received some bug fixes, a new UI for saving and loading, and partially reduced load times. These are all coming in a day one update to Harvestella itself, but the demo will not be updated.
Home on the fantasy range
These all sound like solid tune-ups for Square Enix's fantasy farming adventure. Harvestella is the RPG company's take on farming life, a genre that's been seeing quite the resurgence.
The demo feedback route has worked out well for Square Enix in the past. Specifically, Triangle Strategy made a good few changes and tune-ups between its demo and launch that ultimately felt for the better.
We'll know soon enough whether the same has been done for this farming RPG. Harvestella goes live for Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam this Friday, November 4.

Remember when two of the most creative game producers and directors — Goichi Suda (Suda51 of No More Heroes fame) and Hidetaka ‘Swery’ Suehiro (creator of Deadly Premonition) got together and said they wanted to make a horror game together? That was way back in 2019, and while the pair have since reiterated that the game, Hotel Barcelona, is still on, there's not been a lot of movement. Until today.
VGC reports that trademarks for Hotel Barcelona were filed back on 25th March 2022 in Japan, and on 27th October this year internationally, though the latter is still pending. The trademarks were filed under Swery's company, White Owls, so we're hoping something is happening behind the curtain there!

Idea Factory International has announced that it's bringing the unique, adorable-looking 3D shooter Little Witch Nobeta to the West in the spring of next year. This new take on the third-person shooter, developed by Pupuya Games and Simon Creative, may look cute on the surface, but there are some frightening monsters lurking within the mysterious castle.
As Nobeta, an amnesiac witch, you'll be guided by a little black cat throughout this castle to find out what you're doing there while trying to regain your memories. Playing with an over-the-shoulder camera view, you'll need to explore every crevice while taking out monsters with your magic stave — and you don't just swing it either. Instead of using a gun or a bow, Nobeta can cast ranged magic from a distance.

Xbox has announced that 2021's strategy sim Dune: Spice Wars is headed to the PC Game Pass service — Shiro Games' take on Frank Herbert's iconic literary universe is currently available on PC via Steam Early Access, but should be made available to the paid subscription service in the very near future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lFx4wfc8Tc
Dune: Spice Wars is a 4X real-time strategy set against the arid and isolated backdrop over the fictional planet Arrakis. Taking up control of one of many factions from the Dune universe, players compete for control of the planet and its lucrative "spice" reserve — a plant that forms the root of incredible powers, from extended human life to interstellar travel. Guide troops, establish refineries, balance resources, and deal with your fellow spice fielders by fair means... or foul.
Announced and released in the aftermath of Denis Villeneuve's epic live-action movie, Dune: Spice Wars returns the series to its strategic gameplay roots, as popularized by the extremely popular and genre-defining PC/Amiga release Dune II: Battle for Arrakis (1992). The new game received a major update this past summer, adding dedicated multiplayer servers, peer-to-peer support, new regions, events, and factions.
Heartbreakingly, There's no sign of Kyle Maclachlan, Batista, or Rebecca Ferguson, but Dune: Spice Wars still looks like a very fine time for ruthless, intergalactic entrepreneurs everywhere.

Well, the unfortunate news is that we're probably not going to get anything Zelda-related anytime soon - beyond the experimental feature showcased in the Switch remake of Link's Awakening, anyway - but fear not, because developer Firechick is looking to bring something pretty similar to the Switch with Super Dungeon Maker.

QuByte Interactive has announced that it will be holding an open beta this weekend to test the online stability of its long-time-coming rerelease Breakers Collection. The test period will kick off on PC (via Steam on Friday, November 4, and will rock on for an as-yet-undisclosed amount of time, ahead of the title's January release.
Breakers Collection, as we have reported many times, is a compendium of two cult '90s fighters, Breakers and Breakers' Revenge, which was available in arcades and on the Neo Geo platform in the mid-1990s. The new rerelease features both games in their entirety, sporting modern-day technological boosts such as rollback netcode and crossplay support, as well as a range of cool new features including Team Battle Mode, Interactive Replays, online profiles, and a deep Training Mode.
https://twitter.com/qubytegames/status/1585738737576685569?s=20&t=SvEeQrq8DSxf7_4gyedVOA
If you want in on the beta beatings, then all you need do is wishlist Breakers Collection on Steam and download the beta client prior to the big server switch-on this Friday. While the Breakers titles struggled to find their feet alongside the Street Fighter Alpha series, as well as the then-influx of 3D fighters such as Tekken and Soulcalibur, there is no denying that the series has its own charm, and is still a fun and engaging 2D fighter even today, decades on from its initial release. This new release will provide the dedicated Breakers community with a much-needed official platform for the fighter's competitive scene.
Breakers Collection launches January 12, 2023, on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Physical editions are available to pre-order now exclusively at Strictly Limited Games.

In what is one of the nicer, but extremely late giveaways in the Pokemon space: UK retailer GAME is allowing folks to pick up a free Shiny Eternatus code without going into the store.
As highlighted by Joe Merrick of Serebii.net fame, GAME now has a web form that you can simply fill out to gain access to the Pokemon in Sword and Shield. Here are the details on what you actually get:
"Shiny Eternatus will arrive in your game at Lv. 100 with a Timid Nature and the Pressure Ability. It’ll know the moves Dynamax Cannon, Eternabeam, Sludge Bomb, and Flamethrower, so it should make a powerful addition to your team!"

While the promo is technically suited for the UK region, and some users have noted that they are geo-blocked: others have been able to access it and utilize the email form. Note that you have until November 17 to take advantage (or until they run out), and you can tap someone you know in the UK if the site is giving you trouble.
How to get a free shiny Eternatus in Pokemon Sword and Shield
Just go here, and input your email!
The site indicates that you will not get GAME marketing emails: but rather, this form is just for the code.
Nintendo also provides re-iterated instructions on mystery gift redemption:
To claim your in-game gift, follow these steps:
Launch your Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield
Select Mystery Gift on the X menu.
Select Get a Mystery Gift.
Select Get with Code/Password to save your game and connect to the internet.
Enter your code or password.
Watch as the gift arrives in your game. (Pokémon will appear in your party or your Pokémon Boxes. Items will appear in your Bag.)
Be sure to save your game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cross-country road trip sets off in the new year
HBO has set a premiere date for The Last of Us. The series will debut on January 15 on HBO and streaming via HBO Max.
The show will follow the plot of Naughty Dog's video game The Last of Us, with Pedro Pascal playing the role of Joel and Bella Ramsey playing Ellie.
Naughty Dog shared the news today, alongside a promotional poster for the HBO series.
https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1587837418748657665
The date seemingly leaked out a bit ahead of time, through the HBO Max streaming app. But now HBO and Naughty Dog have locked it in for the start of the new year.
We got a glimpse of the series in an HBO sizzle reel a while back, but more recently got a full teaser trailer, laying out the look and feel of HBO's take on The Last of Us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBRRDpQ0yc0
More PlayStation productions in the works
The Last of Us is far from the only PlayStation property with a silver-screen adaptation in the works. The Twisted Metal series has wrapped filming for Peacock, and the Gran Turismo film recently picked up Stranger Things' David Harbour for its cast.
Tack on reports of adaptations in the works, like Days Gone and Gravity Rush, and there's a lot of PlayStation in the pipeline. Which, depending on how you felt about the Uncharted movie, could be a good or bad thing.
But The Last of Us and HBO does seem like a perfect fit. The series is a dark take on the post-apocalypse and the choices humanity could make in it. Also, importantly, Nick Offerman is playing the role of Bill. That's pretty darn good casting.
HBO's The Last of Us adaptation premieres on January 15, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The unreal shooter arrives early next year
Atomic Heart is locking in a date, after years of development and trailers. Mundfish's surreal shooter Atomic Heart will launch on February 21, 2023.
The first-person shooter has been in development for a few years, blending its BioShock influence with Soviet imagery and surreal surroundings. Every trailer for it has looked pretty fascinating though, as the magic and machinery mix to make something that looks unique, at the very least.
Mundfish dropped a new trailer today alongside the date. You can find that below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Iee7ZHHZE
The new FPS is slated to hit PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It's also headed to Xbox Game Pass.
Right to the heart of it
Atomic Heart is about a society where humans live in peace with their robot companions and servants. Well, at least until something goes wrong and the robots, well, turn on them.
Now, mutated robots are turning on their creators, and your protagonist Major P-3 is sent in to "minimize consequences" and secure classified info.
It looks like this plays out in a very frenetic manner, as your newfound robotic foes are pretty lethal. So Major P-3 gets some tools of their own, wielding powers through a special glove to wreak havoc.
Atomic Heart has had my eye for a while, both for the influences its drawing on and the incredible art style Mundfish is crafting. I dig the surreal, dystopian retro-future the team has imagined. Although I could do with fewer clowns.
We'll see what the retro-future holds when Atomic Heart hits its launch date on February 21, 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I'm still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I'd reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.
Honestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don't get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.

Activision has proudly announced that its recent release Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II has smashed all previous launch records held by the storied franchise, having raked in an incredible $800 million USD in sales over the course of its initial launch weekend.
Released on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on October 28, Modern Warfare II immediately became the most successful entertainment product of 2022. Not only has the rat-a-tat-tat sequel beat out the Call of Duty franchise's own launch record — previously held by 2011's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 — but MWII has also surpassed the combined opening box office revenue of blockbuster movies Top Gun: Maverick and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Wanzer time
Forever Entertainment has locked in a date for the first of its Front Mission remakes. Front Mission 1st: Remake hits Nintendo Switch on November 30.
Developer MegaPixel Studio and Forever Entertainment confirm the news today, with pre-orders opening on November 16.
Two more remakes are in the works as well. Forever Entertainment is also working on remakes of Front Mission 2 and 3. The former is set for 2023, while the latter is just arriving sometime in the future.
A new gameplay trailer for Front Mission 1st: Remake is arriving soon, too. The video will premiere less than 24 hours from this writing, on November 3. You can find it below when it's live:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvj7WerPPF8
Mecha tactics are back in season
Front Mission is a piece of Square's history that is exciting to see return. The strategic maneuvering of Wanzers around environments and big mech management makes it stand out a bit from the PlayStation 1 era of RPGs.
It's been a tactics-heavy year, too. Triangle Strategy started the year off strong, Tactics Ogre: Reborn is right around the corner, and a new Fire Emblem is just a few months away.
With three remakes currently set out, Front Mission 1st: Remake will get to set the tone for what's to come with these updated Front Mission titles. But hopefully it turns out strong. Front Mission is a neat series I've wanted to go back to for a while. Making these entries easily accessible, and putting them on the Switch at that, seems like a worthy endeavor.
Front Mission 1st: Remake hits Nintendo Switch on November 30.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CAUTION
Back in the day, folks used to rotate their palm on their Nintendo 64 controllers for Mario Party minigames, leading to injuries, and an official "glove" release from Nintendo. This time with the Mario Party 64 Switch re-releases (Mario Party 1 and 2) via the expansion pack, they're just adding that warning upfront.
Here's the warning in full for the first game, seen when booting it up:
"CAUTION: To avoid irritation to your skin and/or damage to the control stick, do not rotate it with the palm of your hand. Rotate the control stick with your thumb or by holding it between your thumb and forefinger."

The wild thing about this is that I always won these minigames, and never used my palm. Same thing with the button-mashing contests! Mario Party has caused a lot of folks strife over the past few decades, and this warning caused all those memories to come flooding back.
Here's two of my most memorable Mario Party experiences:
Someone refused to play minigames when they were on my team so that I would get less coins
After losing Totem Pole Pound, someone threw their controller across the room, which hit the N64 and froze the game
Fun times! On the flipside, I've played with a lot of good sports, and will continue to do so with these re-releases. Some of these original minigames just can't be beat, despite numerous attempts to bring them back from the dead in a new flavor.

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…]]></summary>

Fewer than 40 games are confirmed to implement it so far but that number is growing, with Nvidia today announcing that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will include DLSS 3 when it launches for PC on November 18th.

Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced a launch date for its long-awaited PlayStation VR2 hardware (PSVR2) — The PS5 exclusive technology will launch globally February 22, 2023, priced at $550 USD / £530 GBP / €600. The set includes a PSVR2 headset, controllers, and stereo headphones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5L9Mvh7tAk
Alternately, a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle will include the above set complete with a download code for an additional $50/£40/€50. Developed by Firesprite and Guerilla Games, Call of the Mountain is, as you would expect, a VR adventure set within the beautiful, but highly hazardous, futureworld explored in acclaimed adventures Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) and Horizon Forbidden West (2022). The PSVR2 system will have its own library of titles and is not compatible with previous PSVR releases.
If you're interested in picking up the flashy new technology which, to my knowledge, doesn't play Dactyl Nightmare, then pre-orders go live on the official PlayStation Direct store on November 15. SIE hints that not all orders will necessarily be served on launch day, with kits rolling out throughout the last week of February and into early March. For more details, visit the official PlayStation Blog.
These prices put the PS5 and PSVR2 kit somewhere in the region of $1000/£1000. I had some college.
PlayStation VR2 launches worldwide on February 22, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who would you be? I'd be 'The IBS Guy'
Square Enix, in association with developer Acquire, has released a new trailer for its charming-looking adventure sequel Octopath Traveler II. The surprisingly lengthy new preview, which you can check out below, introduces us to two members of the ensemble cast that will make up the game's multi-threaded narrative.
First up, we meet Partitio, or "The Merchant". This slick-tongued, noirish man is packed with the key weapons of wit and charisma, able to talk his way in and out of any sale, or even any situation. Curiously backed by some 1980's sitcom-sounding music, we see Partitio utilize his retail skills to trade with townspeople, hire assistants, and synergize with mercenaries in order to give himself the edge either on the market or in battle. Despite his capitalistic nature, Partitio is shown to have a streak of nobility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUmdgkkYKkU
We are then introduced to the much darker character of Osvald, or "The Scholar". Wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his family, Osvald will escape the ice-cold incarceration of "The Frigid" in order to learn of the true events behind his wife and daughter's killing, (Although this trailer pretty much spoils it, good work, folks). As a studied individual, Osvald can scrutinize townspeople for secrets, and also study enemies in battle to learn their weak points and expose vulnerabilities.
In addition to the two new characters, the trailer also spotlights new travel options, with characters taking to the ocean by canoe, boat, or even a mighty ghost ship! All of Octopath Traveler II's characters will have a "Latent Power", (essentially a Limit Break), activated by building meter in battle. These unique abilities will help to turn the tide of battle in a pinch, so learn your characters' abilities and use them wisely.
Octopath Traveler II launches February 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The next instalment in the mysterious Rusty Lake puzzle series arrives today, and it takes things in a different direction than past games. A time-travelling conundrum that requires one person to play in the past and another in the future, The Past Within is the series’ first co-op puzzler. It’s also the only Rusty Lake game so far to include 3D environments. You can snag a glimpse of the timey-wimey, multidimensional eeriness by watching the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.
Fundamentally, it's a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.

All this with PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, given the right motherboard - and this is a surprisingly great way to jump on 12th-gen, while leaving plenty of space to upgrade to a higher tier CPU down the road.

        <updated>2022-11-01T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn't for Modern Warfare II's cast of c…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-11-01T15:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.]]></summary>

Blizzard are aiming to get her back in Overwatch 2 for November 15th, when the game’s next scheduled patch drops. That still might slip, though. What? I had to get an ice crack in.

This primarily gets you the ad-free version of the site (alongside some other small quality of life bonuses), but after listening to your feedback, it's clear that the thing you really want to sample is the exclusive Premium-tier supporter articles we write alongside our regular games coverage. So we're doing just that. 
For the month of November, we'll be making a selection of supporter articles available to all Standard subscribers. We've also made a bunch of Sin Vega's indie-focused Scout Report posts available to all Standard subscribers right now, too, as a little extra thank you for signing up. And to all our existing Premium tier supporters, we've got something for you as well. As an even bigger thank you for all your continued support, we're doing a bumper crop of supporter articles this month, with the aim of publishing one each day of the week for the whole of November. But wait... there's more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Salt & Pixel and publisher VoxPop Games have revealed Outer Terror, a new arcade bullet hell with roguelite elements coming to PC soon. That's because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won't have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror's inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you'll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mount & Blade 2 Colon Bannerlord is disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad. In fact, it's overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord's design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what's been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn't meaningfully improve it at all.
In between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click "make charcoal", then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you'll discard hundreds of them. You can't do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone's pommel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a good gaming CPU with better content creation performance than the more expensive 5800X3D - even though it's slower than the X3D in gaming. Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. 
The way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that's more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The game is structured into four square panels in a two-by-two grid. Players can move around each of the squares to solve puzzles or click inside each square to interact with the scene. This is where it gets cool: Any object you see that has some sort of frame around it - doorways, paintings, windows, photographs - you can actually move through them and discover new areas to explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canny Overwatch 2 players have reported more success in obtaining skins by grinding for in-game gold in Blizzard’s long-running fantasy MMO World Of Warcraft and converting that into Battle.net balance than by completing weekly challenges in the hero shooter itself. The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.

        <updated>2022-10-31T16:42:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The admission came as part of a response to players asking for more support characters in Overwatch 2, as there are currently only eight of them to pick from right now, versus the ten tanks and whopping 16 damage characters in its overall roster. It's not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.

We seek out spooks even in the heat of summer, and know there's no better mid-winter warmer than a good ghost story. So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?
I know common wisdom considers Halloween to be "Goth Christmas", but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine's Day. Yes, I have spent far too long thinking about this, but I'm determined to stand by my conclusions, thereby dubbing this holiday "Goth Valentine's". Which leads me neatly into the purpose of this feature: games that let you date the monster.

What you’ll find here, then, are SSD offers with genuine discounts only – and with both lightspeed-fast NVMe SSDs and affordable SATA SSDs on early sales, there's something for all kinds of PC builds.

Last year I cut my hand on a CPU cooler radiator. And did you see how dusty my PC was before I cleaned it? That’s basically body horror.
Apparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers. Is an eerie moniker enough to strike fear, even before it has the chance to cause minor injuries or force you into a tedious warranty replacement process? Let’s find out.

Hm. Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they're one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.
It makes sense. They've already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I've collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I've not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.
If you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.

I'm currently competing for the title of trickster-in-chief here at RPS, and I'm never going to have a chance of receiving this promotion unless I reach my daily scare quota. If only there was a way I could package together a collection of scary stories as told my colleagues and claim them all as my own.

Aha! I got you again! They don't call me the Merry Trickster Of UK PC Gaming Websites for nothing! You've been Halloween'd, my friends! To celebrate spooky season, I gathered seven members of the RPS treehouse to tell me about one moment from a PC game that scared them the most. The results were exactly as I expected. Some recounted events in classic horror games that shocked them senseless, whereas others told me anecdotes about games that most wouldn't consider scary at all. The result is seven tales of spooks that are sure to chill your bones this All Hallows' Eve.

It's set a few months after the original game and continues to tell the story of "gay Asian-American teens playing baseball and falling in love". It's also, just like the first game, free to download and play - although you can also name your price and pay $5 for a digital artbook over on Itch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

October 28, 2022
What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as "By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.]]></summary>

I've had an eye on All Quiet Roads for months, but between Tile Cities and Blink Planets it seemed a bit much to throw this recommendation at you as well. But a game exclusively about the thing I hate most holding my interest this well has to be respected. All Quiet Roads also balances relaxing, freeform play with stressful, occasionally overwhelming challenges, giving it a tonal variety that I wasn't really expecting from such a simple concept.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.
Then Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.

A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I'd seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: "I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing."
My second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. "Oh shite. Here we go."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not a very big enjoyer of horror games. On the very rare occasion that I do boot up a horror game, a chemical change seems to occur in my body. The part of my brain responsible for going "holy mother of hell get me away from this scary thing" is dampened. I expect to be scared, and therefore I'm more resilient to said scariness. I might just not be very good at getting into the horror games mindset. My brain is too busy battening down all the hatches and readying the engines of war against the oncoming spookies and ghosties.
The times I've been most scared playing a game are when I don't expect to be scared. And what better way to lull myself into a false sense of security this Halloween than to play an otherwise not-so-scary game, with just one particularly horror-esque moment?

I'm a big Dark Pictures fan, but had some reservations about this latest outing due to its subject matter, which this time around draws more inspiration from real-life serial killers than supernatural legends. Still, by the end of my 90 minutes or so with the game, my feelings had evolved considerably, and I'm happy to say I'm now way more excited for it than I was. In fact, I think this could easily end up as the best Dark Pictures game yet.

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

"We've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscription. I don't think we'll be able to do that forever," Spencer admits. "I do think at some point we'll have to raise some prices on certain things." He was quick to point out, though, that these changes wouldn't come into effect this holiday season, as Microsoft wants to "maintain the prices that we have."

The Ryzen 5600X costs the best part of £200, but the vanilla 5600 is down to £145 at Ebuyer - a great value in my book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m extremely picky with my mobile games. Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts. The app is named for the Snap mechanic, w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Tiny Roar and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have revealed Wanderful, an upcoming "cozy-builder" that looks like a charming and relaxing time. 
Tiny Roar describes the game as a "soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover." Using these tiles, you can create a "unique story-multiverse" at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you're looking to raise a few hairs.


Paranormal Tales has no release window and has only been confirmed for PC so far. What do you think of the bodycam style in video games? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

This is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I've never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.
That is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol's Japanese version has been canceled due to the game's violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol's Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan's equivalent to the United States' ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here's what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


"The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you."

October 26, 2022
As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December's Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega's Mega Drive Mini II, there's a message that reads, "In memory of Rieko Kodama." Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe's tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, "As you understand it. We respected her," confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. 
"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega," Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio's upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they're leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line. 
Here is the statement in full:

One of those Witcher games was given the codename "Canis Majoris" and CDPR called it a "full-fledged" Witcher title. Now, the company has revealed that "Canis Majoris" is actually a remake of the very first Witcher game. 
The official Witcher Twitter account posted the news this morning, revealing that CDPR is working with developer Fool's Theory to make The Witcher using Unreal Engine 5.

More specifically, the studio has revealed that Wo Long will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 3, 2023. That's less than six months away.

The physical version of the game will include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus.
The digital version of the game will include the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus and the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Steelbook Launch Edition

On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.

We've received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we've even previewed the game (read here). 
Now, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new "Into The Night" Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there's a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today's trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it'd be such a great Halloween game – but it's not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it's released. For more information, be sure to check out Game Informer's Redfall hub.

By the end of Bayonetta 3's third chapter, it's operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they're running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.
It's loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin' and hollerin' the entire time.

Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year's event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game's Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein's Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein's Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25.

October 24, 2022
"Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator," a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. "Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o'-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein's Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022." 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

Announced as part of the company's larger celebration for the Fallout series' 25th anniversary, Fallout 4's new-gen update will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC systems. It will include performance mode features for high frame rates, quality features for 4K resolution gameplay, bug fixes, and additional bonus Creation Club content. As for when to expect this update, Bethesda did not reveal a specific date, just that it would be coming sometime in 2023. 
Elsewhere in the 25th Anniversary blog post, Bethesda announced the return of Spooky Scorched, the limited-time Halloween event for Fallout 76. It will run through November 8. There's also a new 25th Anniversary challenge coming to the game. 
"Each day from October 25 to November 8, players can visit the Atomic Shop for a free daily item," the blog post reads. "These free goodies range from handy consumables for your next sojourn through Appalachia to brand-new items, so be sure to check into the Store each day to see what's available." 
Here's a look at the first reward, only available in the Atomic Shop tomorrow, October 25:
You can also complete special challenges during the Fallout 25th Anniversary event in Fallout 76 to unlock even more rewards. Active Prime Gaming subscribers can also claim a special 25th Anniversary Bundle for Fallout 76 starting November 2. You'll have until February 2, 2023, to claim it. In addition to Lunchboxes and Bubblegum, this bundle contains the Vault Boy portrait, Shooting Target Suite, and Lincoln's Repeater Lever Action Skin.

Former Bayonetta 3 voice actor Hellena Taylor has released a new thread of tweets clarifying some of what she said in regards to Platinum Games' "immoral" compensation offer to return to voice the titular character in the threequel. These tweets follow a report from Bloomberg that refuted Taylor's original claims and added clarification from sources as to how Jennifer Hale, the new Bayonetta voice actor, came about getting the role. They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement. 
In Taylor's thread, released October 24, the voice actor says that she feels "the need to defend myself and my reputation in the industry" since "some people are calling me a liar and a golddigger."
