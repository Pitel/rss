Last month, Nintendo surprised fans by adding Mother 3 to the Switch Online's Game Boy Advance library. The only downside is this title hasn't actually been added to the service locally.
Now, to add to the suffering, Nintendo has made new Mother 3 icons available to Switch Online subscribers in Japan. The characters will set you back 10 Platinum Points each and the borders and backgrounds will cost 5 Platinum Points each.

The controller is Dinput. Windows recognizes it as a “6 axis 10 button joystick.” That’s weird for two reasons. It has 9 face buttons, but one of them is a home button, which Windows doesn’t recognize. So, it has 8 Windows-usable butto…]]></summary>

For week 5, the challenges are fairly simple, and the reward is definitely worth your time.


How to complete the week 5 weekly challenges

Week 5's weekly challenges include a few different weapons to use, like a fully automatic battle rifle. The most time consuming will probably be backstabs and longshot kills. Both of these require precise killing, which is ruined if someone moves at the last second. A good way to complete them is by playing in small map playlists (Das Haus 24/7 is currently a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive today revealed all-new details for Victoria 3's first expansion: Sphere of Influence. In Sphere of Influence, rapid technological and societal changes of the Victoria Era allows empires to compete in new lands and with new means. The expansion has a handful of new features including the ability to create your own Power Bloc and then bully, bribe, or befriend other nations to get them to join.




The Great Game


Sphere of Influence also focuses on The Great Game, a 19th-century rivalry between the British and Russian empires over influence in Central Asia. Players can use Prestige to become a Great Power and create their own Power Bloc, from which they can dominate other nations in diplomatic arrangements or use the bloc to pursue common economic or ideological goals.


Players also have the opportunity to play as any of the powers central to The Great Game conflict, including Persia and Afghanistan. The map has been redrawn to highlight the many competing interests during The Great Game.


Other features of Sphere of Influence include Foreign Investments, Nationalization, Subject Interactions, Interest Group Lobbies, and many more systems built around the new Power Bloc feature.


I've got about 30 or so hours in Victoria 3so far and have been waiting for an update like this to jump back in. The ability to ccreate a Power Bloc will really change up the strategies you can use to effectively grow your empire, and I'm excited to see how it all works.


To celebrate the news, a Trains Bonus Content Pack with ten new 3D models for trains from the early days of steam to the golden age of rail is available to download for free for anyone who owns Victoria 3.


Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence is set to release on PC on May 6, 2024 for $29.99.

Deadline reports that Rooster Teeth general manager Jordan Levin made the announcement at a company wide meeting and in an internal memo. 


“It’s with a heavy heart I announce that Rooster Teeth is shutting down due to challenges facing digital media resulting from fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and monetization across platforms, advertising, and patronage,” Levin wrote. 


Even though media companies are currently experiencing some extreme volatility, Rooster Teeth's closure still comes as a shock. In his memo, Levin noted that the shutdown is going to be an ongoing process, and we won’t be seeing Rooster Teeth vanish immediately. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloud Strife's massive Buster Sword is just as much a fixture of the character as his spikey blonde hair. But how much would that immense weapon actually weigh? 


Whether you are a fan of the RPG genre or not, if you follow gaming, you've likely heard of Cloud Strife. The stoic protagonist from Final Fantasy 7 has appeared in countless titles over the years, sometimes even with a new look. However, one iconic detail of Cloud's attire is his Buster sword. While the sword looks wholly unwieldy, Cloud easily manipulates his Buster Sword like he's swinging around a whiffle ball bat. How feasible is this?


The best way to bring the Buster Sword into reality is to try to break it down into its materials and parts. From there, it's just a matter of tying in real-life weight.

While that doesn't help nail down the release date, the stunning gameplay on show was enough to convince me that the wait will be worth it. Kinitsu-Gami will be available on Xbox Game Pass on day one, so subscribers won't have to wait patiently to get their hands on it. This isn't an Xbox exclusive, though; it's also heading to PC and PS5. 


Kinitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is an incredibly unique title that wears its Japanese influences on its sleeve, similar to games like Ghost of Tsushima. It's been almost a year since the game was first revealed during a similar Xbox event, but the most rec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Partner Showcase, Atlus revealed Persona 3 Reload Episode Aigis, The Answer, will in fact be coming to the RPG after all. It will be part of a 3-wave Expansion Pass for Persona 3 Reload that includes BGM sets and Velvet costumes as well. While the cosmetic content releases next week and in May, The Answer releases in September.




Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass


The Expansion Pass is split into three waves. The first wave releases on March 12 and includes a Persona 5 Royal EX BGM Set and a Persona 4 Golden EX BGM Set. Then, in May, Expansion Pass owners will receive the Velvet Costume cosmetics and a new BGM Set. Finally sometime in September, Episode Aigis, The Answer, will be released. The Answer is essentially post-ending DLC to Persona 3 which expands the story and adds some new content as well.


Surely, not everyone is going to be happy with this news.  For starters, many were shocked to see that Persona 3 Reload would not include The Answer in the base game. Also, choosing to bundle it into an Expansion Pass that features some music and a few costumes with a $35 price tag seems a bit steep when the base game was already $70.


Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get access to the Expansion Pass for free through January 31, 2025.


Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass will be available starting March 12 when the first BGM wave drops. It will cost $34.99 and be available on Steam, Game Pass, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Frostpunk 2, including a release date.  First announced in 2021, 11 Bit Studios’ tense city-management sim arrives on July 25, and it’s also coming to PC Game Pass.
A new trailer shows off some of the game’s bleak, choice-driven gameplay. You’re charged with leading a city set within an inhospitable frozen wasteland, making decisions about how it’s governed to keep mouths fed and, hopefully, happy. That includes managing labor, politics, and even the food supply, which can ingratiate you to citizens or, worst case, cause them to revolt.  


Frostpunk 2 will first launch on PC but will come to consoles at a later date (including Xbox Game Pass). You can read our review of the first Frostpunk here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three classic STALKER games (Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat) are bound to be released on Xbox and PlayStation consoles for the first time. And better yet, it's happening today.


Confirmed during today's Xbox Partner Showcase, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Legends of the Zone Trilogy is out today for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The Xbox One version hits today, while a patch is due out later this year to bring additional graphic enhancements and features, per the Xbox Wire post. [Update: After publication, GSC Game World confirmed that the collection is coming to PS4 and PS5 in a similar manner. We've updated the article to reflect as much.]


While unprecedented, this move isn't necessarily totally unexpected, as the upcoming STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on its way. With the long-awaited sequel bound to drop on September 5, 2024, releasing the three classic PC games on consoles before the big event is an excellent opportunity for GSC Game World to drum up some excitement well ahead of time. 


The Legends of the Zone


It's going to be particularly interesting to see whether the Legends of the Zone re-release will also launch on PC, and what sort of upgrades might the developer have spliced into the package. Whatever the case may be, it's curious to see whether the mod.io support that GSC plans to roll out for Legends of the Zone will match up to its the massive mod support S.T.A.L.K.E.R. already sees on PC.


Regardless, the ability to play the old STALKER games on consoles is not something we expected to see, so it's a thrilling development no matter what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, everybody. Want to kill all humans?
There is no shortage of terrible things buried deep underground, but, in Ancient Weapon Holly, you get to be the worst of them. This roguelike from Acquire, one of the studios behind the Octopath Traveler series, puts you in control of a powerful robot that seeks revenge on the humans that buried it for thousands of years. Reaching the surface and killing all humans will take a bit longer than you’d expect, though.
At first glance, Ancient Weapon Holly is a serviceable, fun, action-packed roguelite. The game consists of ten levels to play through, each one increasing in difficulty. Holly starts with a basic ranged attack and the ability to open up pits in the floor for enemies to fall into. These can be closed up to instantly kill most enemies, particularly once you’ve upgraded your attack power through the game’s version of a sphere grid. It is an interesting mechanic and the combat is chaotic enough to keep you interested for a few hours, but the game’s lack of depth makes it feel repetitive long before Holly reaches the surface.

Titled Creatures Of Ava, it's a fantasy game about saving Pokémon-like creatures, as opposed to, well, imprisoning them and using them for labour (Palworld, I'm looking at you).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios has announced that the follow-up to their 2018 survival city builder, Frostpunk 2, will arrive on July 25, 2024. You can pre-order the deluxe edition today to get access to the beta.


The original game focused on your building a city in the middle of a disastrous ice age to shelter your people. You had to keep them warm, gather resources, and endure harsh storms. Frostpunk 2 takes place 30 years later, and the focus moves back to a larger picture with your city sprawling out into much larger proportions with different factions vying to have their ambitions met.




The new trailer doesn’t have a lot of information we don’t already know (aside from the release date), but it does give us another glimpse at the direction it’s going with big, sprawling cities compared to the intimate ones of the original.


The trailer also shows off its Deluxe Edition, which includes seven-day beta access in April, post-launch DLC, access to story mode three days before launch, a novella, an artbook, and a soundtrack.


I enjoyed the original Frostpunk, but after I completed its campaign (on maybe my third attempt), I didn’t have much desire to return to it or its DLC. I love survival city builders, though, and Frostpunk is royalty among them, so I’ll probably give the second a try.


Frostpunk 2 releases on July 25, 2024 for PC, with Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions afterward. It will be released on day one on PC Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More Warriors of Light will be queuing up later this month. Square Enix's massive MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV got a full launch date for Xbox Series X|S consoles today, locking it in for March 21.


Announced during the Xbox Partner Showcase for March 2024, FF XIV will open its doors for Xbox players later this month. The service has already hosted an open beta for the MMO, but starting March 21, Xbox owners will be able to fully dig into the world of Eorzea.


Xbox Game Pass Ultimate owners will also be able to pick up the Starter Edition through Game Pass, between March 21 and April 19. If it's similar to the Starter Edition offered on other platforms, it'll provide entitlement for the base game A Realm Reborn and the first two expansions, Heavensward and Stormblood, as well as a thirty-day sub.




If you still need convincing and haven't heard the meme yet, Final Fantasy XIV also offers a generous free trial that includes access to the aforementioned A Realm Reborn, Heavensward, and Stormblood. You won't get some of the nice features like additional retainers, but if you're looking to experience a good story in an MMO world, it's a good option.


For those Xbox owners bummed they don't have the most recent Final Fantasy release on their console right now, Final Fantasy XIV might be the balm you need. I can attest that, even though I showed up years late to the party, Final Fantasy XIV is a darn good time, whether you're soloing or partying up. Or just exploring all the sights, sounds, and mysteries the Party Finder has to offer.


Final Fantasy XIV officially launches for Xbox Series X and S on March 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About eight months ago, Capcom and Microsoft revealed Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess in somewhat vague terms. It is an action game based in and inspired by historical Japan, but that was about all we knew. Today, Capcom showed a lot more gameplay and offered some additional insight into the single player game. Plus it detailed more of exactly what the game is on its Xbox Wire page.
The action is defined as "dancing swords," but you will also be making decisions about what villagers you will take with you on your journey, leading to some strategic elements. You will apparently be making preparations for battle during the day to protect your Maiden and the village before the night, which is when battle takes place.


Capcom and Microsoft do not have a release date for the game yet, but it is apparently coming this year and will be included with Game Pass subscriptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xbox kicked off the Xbox Partner Showcase with Unknown 9: Awakening. Originally teased in 2020, we haven't really seen much about the action-adventure game. However, developer Reflect Entertainment have released a new Announcement trailer highlighting the protagonist Haroona and detailing the gameplay players can expect when the game releases in Summer 2024.




Based on the gameplay it reminds me a lot of Assassin's Creed with powers. Haroon, portrayed by actress Anya Chalotra best known as Yennefer in The Witcher, yields powerful skills called Umbric abilities. With these powers Haroon can manipulate people, objects, and weapons from a distance.


Unknown 9: Awakening will release in Summer 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

The new and extremely damp survival horror game, set in a heavily flooded New England city in the 1920s, is pivoting the studio to a "'horror-first' focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration and its Lovecraftian setting and story". This is a step away from the studio's mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let's peer through the weeds a bit further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the March Xbox Partner Preview, we’ve got a first look at the gameplay of 11 Bit Studio’s The Alters. A game about employing yourself in space.


The Alters has you play as a miner named Jan Dolski, who gets stranded on another planet.




To stay alive, he needs to make use of a base that, unfortunately, requires multiple trained people to run. Conveniently, the planet is also home to a substance called “Rapidium,” which allows Jan to make different versions of himself called Alters. Each one is an alternate version of himself with their past having been changed.


The trailer gives examples where Jan fights to save his marriage or doesn’t leave his hometown. He’s able to alter choices in his past and build them into these Alters, which gives them experience that he doesn’t have, so they can help him survive. However, the trailer points out that their different pasts can create friction between the crew, as they have their own goals and personalities.


It looks like an interesting concept. I just have to wonder how the gameplay will balance out between management and exploration. Is there crafting? I hope not, because I’ve done enough of that.


The Alters is set to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last July, Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy XIV, the critically acclaimed and long-running MMORPG, would be coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. 
This news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. 


The timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game's next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 
Before Dawntrail, though, you'll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story. Getting caught up should be a lot of fun, though, and you'll get to find out why Final Fantasy XIV is ranked so high on Game Informer's ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game. 
Are you going to play Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox later this month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

The game is set within the popular sci-fi media franchise and is a third-person adventure starring Haroona (played by The Witcher's Anya Chalotra), a woman gifted with mysterious abilities. The game's official website has the following synopsis: 
That includes, from what we can tell, sucking people's souls out of their bodies and telepathically blasting enemies through destructible environments. Haroona can also pull enemies, control their minds, and more. The game also features parkour-style platforming across an Indian city.

Things decide they weren’t creepy enough, and suddenly the train is a bit worse for wear. A former inmate steps up to say hi, and the protagonist drops his standard issue horror flashlight, but manages to escape out the rear of the train. He finds himself in city streets, turns around, and sees an unspeakable horror towering into the sky.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alters is a fascinating new sci-fi survival game from 11 Bit Studios, makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine. First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by "himself," I mean multiple versions of himself.
Jan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the "what if" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. 


The Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today's Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it's coming to Game Pass for console and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima is finally riding to PC. The game’s Director’s Cut is making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 16 and includes PC-specific enhancements. 
In terms of content, the Director’s Cut includes the full game, the Iki Island story expansion, and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. 


Developer Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.
Per the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” 
Ghost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. 
Ghost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we approach the arrival of the Fallout TV adaptation, it's not too much of a stretch to assume a lot of people in the gaming world will be thinking about Bethesda's ongoing series. With that, don't be surprised to learn that you can now get customized Xbox Series X|S controllers themed after the post-apocalyptic franchise.


The latest news story over on Xbox Wire shows the control pads that have been given some Fallout love. I don't mean they're highly irradiated. Rather, there's a bunch you can now get from the Design Lab that you could argue have been inspired by the games.




There are actually four variants to pick from: Vault Dweller, Brotherhood, Pip-Boy, and Mutants. Each of them comes with the same basic covering on the controller, but with slightly different colors to the D-pad and analog sticks.


I feel so S.P.E.C.I.A.L. now


If you've never used the Xbox Design Lab, it basically allows you to create your own Xbox control pads by customizing the look. You can change the color of the main body, add rubber grips on the back, and put some engraving on it as well.


Obviously, with this latest one boasting an official Fallout design, it's not going to be cheap. A basic controller with the new look – and nothing else being changed – would set me back just under $85. Who says gaming isn't an expensive hobby?


This also comes just a day after it was announced that a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed Xbox Series X would be launching this week. March 7, to be precise, if you're interested. Not me, though. Guess I'll be sticking with boring black for now.

Nintendo's latest collaboration with Lego has resulted in a handful of Animal Crossing sets, a crossover that fans have been begging for ever since the firms' first collaboration, the LEGO Super Mario sets, were announced back in March 2020 — coincidentally Animal Crossing: New Horizons' launch month.
In the years since, we've seen a bunch of Nintendo-themed Lego sets encompassing the more play-focused Super Mario series to the grander, more expensive sets like the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Mario 64 '?' Block, and the mighty Bowser, which are aimed at older gamers.

Alas, I am sad to report that I still do not like Nightingale. From what I've played so far, the game is an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind, which makes you feel divorced from the very world you inhabit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The day I stop talking about Doom mods is the day I've been captured by aliens who have taken over my body, but they don't know how to operate it. In fact, I  need to work out a system to let everyone know I'm not the real me. For now, let's take a look at a curious monstrosity that's coming to id Software's iconic FPS.


Over on ModDB, user Anya_Forger is in the midst of modding Doom 2 so that reminds us all of the pain that once was 1996's Bubsy 3D. It's a curious mix, I have to admit, but it remains to be seen why this is happening at all. I'm weirdly excited for it.


Image via Anya_Forger/ModDB.


Currently, "Bubsy Doom" is still a work-in-progress, with no release date yet. For now, you can download a small taste, which converts the classic Doom menu screen into the one from Bubsy. There are plans to hopefully incorporate levels and MIDI sounds from the latter into the former, but currently the creator is busy with real-life obligations.


It could breathe new life into the long-forgotten games


While the modder is planning to bring Bubsy 2 into Doom as well, it's the mention of incorporating Bubsy 3D that will be cause for some curiosity. It's generally regarded as one of the worst games ever released, which in a way makes it a pretty significant part of gaming history.


And for all we know, Anya_Forger may actually enjoy the game. Who are we to judge? All I can say is they seem genuinely excited about making their project, saying "aren't these mod developers wonderful?"


It's also another notch in the bedpost of Doom modding. There are so many out there, from Doom meets Friday the 13th to Doom but all the sound effects are from Half-Life. We've seen it all. Well, nearly all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're still not sure what's happening with Palworld regarding Nintendo's investigation of the game. I mean, we all know it's been heavily inspired by Pokémon, but if you want to see it veer even closer, a recent demake project really makes the world look like Pokémon.


As spotted by WCCFTech, YouTube channel 64 Bits recently uploaded a proof-of-concept video that shows what Palworld would look like as a DS game. This includes giving it the retro look and top-down view you'd imagine it would have if it was released on the Nintendo console.




In fact, the description under the video says the team was heavily inspired by "Pokémon Ranger, Black, White, Diamond, Pearl, basically all the DS Pokémon titles." However, they've also taken some cues from the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.


A plethora of your preferred pixelated pals


The video itself really does show what Palworld could potentially look like if it was truly styled after older entries in Nintendo's dominant IP. It's actually quite cute. However, it should be noted that it is just a video. As far as I can tell, there's no attempt to actually demake the game in this manner.


Nor would anyone likely dare. If Nintendo is keen on pursuing Pocketpair over copyright issues, there's no way the community would risk litigation by making their own similarly-inspired project.


As for the game itself, it feels like we're passing through the tail end of Palworld's initial popularity. The studio is still sending out updates, but we're probably not going to see another uptick until the game fully releases, whenever that's going to be.

Indeed, rebalancing certain weapons and Stratagems was on the docket for Arrowhead, for better or for worse.


While the nerfs aren't quite so serious as to become a genuine traitor to Super Earth, many will be sorry to hear that the game's most potent small arms and gear - the Railgun, the Breaker, and the Personal Shield - have all been nerfed. That's the bad news, yes, but lots of goodies await as part of Helldivers 2's first rebalancing update, even though it may leave Helldivers with very few ways of dealing with heavily armored enemies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service shooter from Batman: Arkham developer Rocksteady Studios, debuted last month to mixed reviews from both critics and fans alike. However, Rocksteady is looking to pump something new into the game with the release of Joker as a playable character. 
Teased back in January as an Elseworlds version of the popular villain, this Joker, notably not the same voiced by Mark Hamill in the Arkham games, goes live on March 28. Rocksteady revealed this release date the same day its parent company, Warner Bros., announced it is doubling down on live-service and free-to-play games.

The patch nerfs three of what were hitherto the best Helldivers 2 guns and gear pieces - the SG-225 Breaker shotgun, the RS-422 railgun, and the SH-32 shield generator backpack, all of which break Arrowhead's pretty straightforward golden rule that "each gun has its purpose and none is strictly better than another".

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of Minor Patch 01.000.100 is the addition of new environmental challenges that appear at random on many of the game's various planets. Arrowhead says that includes fire tornadoes, meteor showers, "and many more." The other big change affects Eradicate missions, which task helldivers with killing a specified amount of bug enemies in a small area.

Every now and then you get an indie developer who you can rely on to deliver a banger pretty much every time. New Star Games is one such developer, having already scored healthy scores on Nintendo Life in the past for New Star Manager (which scored 8), Retro Bowl (9), and Retro Goal (8).
Alongside its Switch releases, it’s also been responsible for a bunch of fantastic mobile games, including the likes of the New Star Soccer series, New Star Cricket, and New Star Baseball. Essentially, everything New Star touches turns to gold, but it’s also fair to say it has a style of game it’s best known for: retro-style sports games.

Get your Rawst Berries at the ready, folks, because you're about to feel a burn. The 3DS is now a retro console. Okay, maybe not officially. But it is certainly old enough for Nintendo to be using it in sentimental flashback sequences and for that, we feel ancient.
This revelation came to us thanks to a new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet advert by Nintendo of Japan (thanks, GamesRadar), which, in an attempt to pull on our nostalgia heartstrings, seems to be positioning the OG 3DS as the ultimate image of old.

You might remember this vocation from the original Dragon's Dogma; then as now, it combines relatively straightforward bow combat with various breeds of enchanted ammunition, for a surprisingly technical skillset that is enjoyable to faff around with.

Developed by A Heartful of Games, Mutants Unleashed is set to be a 3D brawler/platformer which takes place shortly after the events of 2023's hit animated film. A new band of mutants are descending on New York City and it is up to the heroes in a half shell to stop them — we won't go into details about the movie's plot here, but seriously, you should watch it.

The sentences are described as 'historic' since they target corporate actors rather than private individuals. However, background to the case makes this case historic for entirely different reasons.

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>

We already knew The Unknown Killer, Sable Ward Survivor, and Greenville Square map would arrive on March 12 with the All Things Wicked Chapter.

The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. 


In Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled "pawn" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.

That's big for Team Hollywood, but I still have a hard time believing that Dune has done more for movies than it has for video games — so long as you ignore the kerfuffle over whether it influenced Star Wars.


Even though the Dune games are far from occupying our most vivid memories of the real-time strategy boom of the '90s, the whole genre owes its existence to this series. Also, there's more to Dune games than just RTS. Not all of the series' forays into other genres generated success, but even its failures have stories worth telling.

I visited Capcom last month to play the game for about three hours, and you can read Game Informer's Dragon's Dogma 2 preview impressions here, but I also spoke to director Hideaki Itsuno about how the game will run on consoles. 
Sitting in Capcom's San Francisco, California, office, just 30 minutes to go until my interview with Itsuno, I saw that he tweeted about Dragon's Dogma 2's framerate. Specifically, he revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Dragon's Dogma 2 will release with an uncapped framerate. It was an interesting announcement, considering "uncapped framerate" is typically something I associate with PCs – not the PlayS…]]></summary>

Once you get to a point in the game where you find a weapon or frame you want, you’ll also have to know where to get the components. One of the more elusive resources in the game is Tellurium, so we’ll help you find the best place to farm this rare crafting material in Warframe.


Where to farm Tellurium in Warframe


The best place to farm Tellurium in Warframe is in the Survival mission, Ophelia on Uranus. It does not matter if you play this in normal mode or on Steel Path. As long as you survive this mission for at least ten minutes, your chances of obtaining at least one unit of this resource are quite high.

According to one of the company's executives, AMD is now ready to lean more heavily towards AI-based technologies.


Whether big things really are on the horizon for AMD's AI efforts remains to be seen, of course, but the CTO Mark Papermaster believes 2024 will be a "huge year" for the company in this regard. In a recent interview hosted on the No Priors podcast (via IGN) Papermaster said that AMD now has a full stack of AI-based hardware and software capabilities, which will help in "enabling [their] entire portfolio" of services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.
Warning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

The 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.
Players take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

        <updated>2024-03-05T18:35:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it launched last October, Alan Wake 2 was noted as a superb follow-up to its cult Xbox 360 predecessor. Visually, it was something to behold. However, being quite a graphically demanding game meant people with older hardware were left out—until now.


Recently, Eurogamer was given exclusive access to an upcoming patch for Alan Wake 2 which aims to optimize the sequel for previous-gen graphics cards. Specifically, the update will put focus on making the game compatible with Nvidia GTX 10-series GPUs, powered by the Pascal architecture.




In a benchmark test, a Digital Foundry video found that, once the patch starts rolling out on March 6, those with GTX hardware should see some pretty significant upticks in performance.


It's not a cure-all, though


Currently, the likes of the GTX 1060 (which is the fourth most used GPU on Steam) don't support mesh shaders, something AW2 uses for better visual acuity. However, the new patch should fix this. 


The video above shows that framerates do increase, boosting overall performance by around 45%, even up as much as 85% for the likes of the GTX 1080.


However, the aforementioned 1060 is still not entirely suitable for the game to run at a decent rate. While Digital Foundry saw increases from 15 to 25 frames on average (thanks to the removal of mesh shaders) in dense areas, this still falls short of what most gamers expect these days, which is 30fps at the very minimum.


There also appear to be no optimizations for the AMD equivalent, the RX 580, a card that came out in 2017. Given that Team Red is no longer supporting this GPU, it's probably not in Remedy's best interests to make Alan Wake 2 compatible with this (and much older) hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steam Deck may have its work cut out for it soon, as pre-orders for the upcoming Claw device from MSI are being taken. We also have a release date, with one of the models launching on March 8 in the US, followed by the other two variants a week later.


As reported by Videocardz, the Claw is up on sites like Newegg, with options to place a pre-order ready for launch day. There are three variations planned, and it looks like the mid-range device releases first, priced at $749. Which is not cheap, really.




For that price, you'll get a Windows-based handheld gaming PC with an Intel Core Ultra 7-155H CPU under the hood and 512GB of NVMe SSD storage.


And many more initialisms


There is a cheaper model in the Intel Core Ultra 5-135H variant, which also comes with 512GB capacity. This is currently priced at $699 on Newegg and with a March 15 release date.


The same goes for the more expensive Claw, which will set you back $799. That benefits from the same processor as the mid-range model but does have 1TB of SSD storage.


On top of this, MSI recently announced that the Claw also comes with seven days of Ubisoft+ for free. Whether that's going to justify the cost is dependent on how often you're likely to use Ubisoft's service, I suppose. Also, the fact that the above tweet says the offer available is from February 15 is a bit odd seeing as the device isn't even out yet. Not sure if that's a typo or not.


In any case, we're seeing quite the flood of Steam Deck competitors hit the market lately. We've already had offerings from ASUS and Lenovo, but it feels as though Valve's mobile PC is still a lot of people's first choice for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios' TV adaptation of Fallout is right around the corner, premiering April 12 on Amazon Prime. You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. 
That's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.


As you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. 
It's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. 
For more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series. After that, check out the first Fallout TV series trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hades, the critically acclaimed roguelite from developer Supergiant Games, is coming to Netflix later this month. It will be available to all subscribers on iOS devices starting March 19, but you can pre-register right now.
While Netflix might sound like an odd fit for a game that's available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, Netflix says this mobile version of Hades features 60 FPS gameplay, redesigned menus and interfaces, fully customizable on-screen controls, cloud saves, achievements, and offline play. 
Check out a new trailer for Hades on Netflix for yourself below: 


We really enjoyed Hades here at Game Informer, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in our review for being "a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships," amongst other things like its high-octane action gameplay. 
Hades coming to Netflix might be the perfect excuse to replay the game ahead of the Early Access debut of its sequel, Hades II, which is set to begin this year. 
Hades joins a growing list of great games available now or soon on Netflix, like Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, Katana Zero, Death's Door, and Braid: Anniversary Edition.

        <updated>2024-03-05T16:33:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Paso, Elsewhere developer Strange Scaffold has announced a five-game deal with publisher Frosty Pop. As part of the announcement, they’ve revealed a trailer for their next game, Life Eater, which is out on April 16, 2024.


I find this trailer rather unsettling.




The trailer shows off the game’s timeline interface where you must learn the habits and schedule of your quarry so that you may find the opportunity to abduct them. You play as a “modern day druid” who is tasked with performing an annual sacrificial ritual to delay the end of the world. It looks like once you have your quarry, you then take their organs to “water the flower.”


Life Eater looks to be a rather evocative game. It has you violate the lives of others while framed as someone performing a necessary evil. Just the fact that you’re learning intimate details of the lives of others and monitoring them for the moment to strike is rather discomforting. The information on the game even suggests that the whole “dark god” angle might be false. I'd play it.


The store page promises “replayable blend of authored and generated stories.” It features music from David Mason who was the composer of Dredge.


As an aside, there are modern-day Druids, as Druidry is a modern religion based on pagan cultures. I don’t think they generally converse with dark gods and perform sacrifices. Just weird to see that as a contextual descriptor.


Life Eater releases on PC on April 16, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maddeningly good fun.
Berserk Boy has been tipped as a Mega Man-inspired 16-bit adventure, but it’s actually closer to Inti Creates Gunvolt series, and even then feels markedly different.
Taking place in a future world where a scientist named Dr. Genos has gone rogue, you play Kei, a young boy who teams up with firebird Fiore to battle his way to saving the universe. The narrative isn’t particularly noteworthy, but it’s well handled with attractive intermittent stills and quick dialogue exchanges. It’s certainly less intrusive than the Gunvolt series in this respect, interjecting just enough story to make things whole without making you labour through excruciatingly drawn-out reams of waffle. Instead, its waffle is brief, occasionally mildly amusing, and mostly to the point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Berserk Boy is the legally distinct lovechild of Sonic The Hedgehog and Mega Man X, on account of how it fondly emulates the Blue Blur’s speedy momentum and the Dorky Mega’s various power-altering suits. That anatomically tricky relationship is enticing by itself, but even if those retro action platformers just register as historical relics in your memory, Berserk Boy does enough that’s new and interesting that it doesn’t need to rely on aping its inspirations. My only beef is that credits rolled before I was properly given a chance to test my newfound robo-bashing muscles.

If you like ravaged Gothic masonry and dramatic evening skies, you might like Voin. If you dislike fighting fireball-lobbing demons with a sword, you might not like Voin. If you like open-ended, changeable levels full of loot and secrets, you might like Voin. If you are confused about whether you'll like or dislike Voin, you might want to try it for yourself during the first public Steam playtest on Friday, March 8th.

Having spent all of 30 minutes with an early playtest build, I'm cautiously impressed. I suspect there are cooler, less-known inspirations at work, but this feels like a Demon's Souls-ified Doom Eternal that doesn't quite have Doom Eternal's swagger and precision, probably because it is the work of just one developer, Nikita Sozidar, rather than hundreds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moomin, the popular Finish comic character from the 1940s, is getting a video game in 2024 – and we're ready for it. You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.
I had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.
Check out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.

Well, that was quick... But also slow.
That Nintendo would take action against programs that circumvent security and open up obvious avenues to playing Switch games without having purchased them is entirely unsurprising given the platform holder's historic 'emulation is piracy' stance. But the speed with which Tropic Haze, the makers of Switch emulator Yuzu, capitulated to the platform holder's demands is yet another indication of the sobering strength of Nintendo's legal teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Little Knight Games has revealed Mira and the Legend of the Djinns, an upcoming 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania inspired by Moroccan mythology. Set to be published by Assemble Entertainment, which is publishing Endzone 2 this spring, Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is due out on PC via Steam this year. 
In classic Metroidvania fashion, you can expect plenty of enemies and secrets to discover with a variety of tools, items, and abilities as you progress through the game. Plus, unlockable moves add flair to your exploration and combat encounters as you attempt to uncover the secret of the last Djinn. 
Check out Mira and the Legend of the Djinns for yourself below:
 

"Not every ancient treasure belongs in a museum, as treasure hunter Yuba discovers within the debris of the kingdom of Fallen Amazgesh," a press release reads. "There, Yuba meets a Djinn named Mira, a race long lost to the world of man, and the pair team up together to escape the ruins and discover Mira's lost memories."
Little Knight Games says the game's combat "emphasizes fluidity and experimentation, and allows you to switch between weapons and elemental modes on the fly." The Germany-based studio says it's a team of seven people from different countries around the world and that Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is a love letter to Metroidvanias, "featuring a world based on the Moroccan and Amazigh mythology." 

"Morocco has a rich culture filled with fantasy stories about Djinns and mysterious creatures," the press release reads. "With the team's diverse background, they wanted to show this in their very first game." 
Other Mira and the Legend of the Djinns features include a sprawling map full of secrets, fast action combat, and a mystery to keep you pushing forward. 
Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is due out on PC this year. 
While waiting for its release, read Game Informer's top 10 Metroidvanias to play right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.


Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.

Two universal conveniences: your shopping basket is now shared across devices, so no losing track of things you meant to buy later; and buying gift copies is now less faffy. More conditional: you can now choose to make individual games private, meaning no one will ever see if you own them or are playing them. I won't ask why you might want to hide any particular games.

The settlement details are quite cut and dry. Tropic Haze will pay Nintendo $2.4 million in damages and will halt all work on Yuzu and cease hosting Yuzu, distributing its code, or anything that promotes Yuzu and circumvents Nintendo's copyright protection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.
He's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.

        <updated>2024-03-04T17:59:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Greedfall 2: The Dying World reveals that the game is launching into Early Access via Steam sometime this summer. The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.
Premiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. 


Spiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: 


Once its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of the first Greedfall here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Sun, the studio behind Moonlighter and The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, has announced its city-building RTS, Cataclismo, is coming in July.
Cataclismo was first revealed last year and was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.


The game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. 
Cataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.]]></summary>

The new season will be a prelude to roguelite spin-off Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, it'll have a new mission type, enemies, new overclocks, and the devs are looking into letting players activate past seasons.

In the middle of the white space there is a curious little yellow machine, a kind of motorised plunger akin to an oil derrick. In the story of Sixty Four, you're late to some kind of social engagement, somewhere beyond that beaming expanse of whiteness. But there is time, even as texts from a friend appear down the lefthand margin, to mess around with the strange yellow machine.

This weekend saw the release of the Crystal Creations Stuff Pack, a DLC for The Sims 4 that takes the ability to find crystals (already in the game) and straps on your Sims making them into semi-precious, semi-magic jewellery that can be charged up by the moon. What I find more interesting is that this launched with some official IRL Sims plumbob jewellery that you can buy and wear around your own precious, swan-like neck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. 


Players must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.

Where some see an overpriced, memory-deprived albatross of a graphics card, I’ve only ever seen a fast and feature-rich GPU whose 12GB of VRAM is demonstrably fine for 99.95% of games at 4K. A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.
Now, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.

The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. 


Or at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described "professional fraudster" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's looking increasingly likely that Gearbox Entertainment is going to be sold by Embracer. In a town hall with staff earlier this week, CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford reportedly told staff that a decision had been made regarding the studio's future, with more details to be shared in March.

Embracer bought Gearbox for $1.3 billion (around £1.02 billion) in 2021, but it was reported that they were looking to sell last year as part of ongoing layoffs, closures and divestments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

I propose to you that there has not. Sewer levels are the worst. They have always been the worst, and will always be the worst. There is no redeeming feature that can make sewer levels good, fun or enjoyable, and I come to you today saying they must stop. No more sewer levels, developers. Please. I beg you. Especially you, Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster. You're the chief offender in this whole mess, and both my nostrils and my sanity simply cannot take it anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.
No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.
Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.]]></summary>

It's the game adorning our upcoming issue of Game Informer, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game's opening hour or so. 
In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game's first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon's pivot to this new genre.

Having now played the opening 90 minutes of the game ahead of tonight's Wicked Inside showcase, that initial excitement has settled into more of a 'Hoo boy, this thing is hard as nails. Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.' It's definitely verging on the edge of being just a teensy bit too punishing for my personal taste, but even though my arse got thoroughly whomped time and time again during this initial prologue section, there's still something about No Rest For The Wicked that's left me quietly captivated.

        <updated>2024-03-01T15:56:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game, is getting its final content update next week, less than a year after its launch. However, the game will still be available to play. 
Players who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.
Crash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game's support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it's nice that the game won't be disappearing for the time being (especially since it's quite fun), it's a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. 
We quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, "Crash Team Rumble's take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try." 


In related news, Toys for Bob announced that it's splitting from Activision Blizzard to go independent and potentially partner with Microsoft. You can read more about the studio's plans here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahhhh love is in the air. Or maybe it's the Mako...regardless, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is finally out on PlayStation 5 and that's something we can all celebrate. We had a great time with it – read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review here – and one of the many reasons we enjoyed our 80-plus hours playing is because of the various relationships within the game and Cloud's party. Whether you're Team Clerith or Team Clifa, or maybe Team Cloud XIII (is that a thing?), there's plenty that will leave you satisfied. 
Chief among those things is the special date night that happens within the Gold Saucer. We won't spoil when it happens in the game, and we won't discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member. That means we were able to take part in all possible dates at the Gold Saucer, and we captured each for you to watch below. 
Here's Every Gold Saucer Date In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth


For more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, and then check out our guide of the best side quests in the game. After that, check out our Queen's Blood tips and tricks (and our best deck build), and then read about how New Game Plus works in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. That's not all, though – we also have a ranking of every minigame and a segway showdown between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.
It’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.

Good for them, but maybe too late for some. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that it seemed Activision Blizzard were closing Toys For Bob's California headquarters and laying off 86 people. Still, the new independent Toys For Bob say they're working on something new and "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft.

Contrary to some reports, today's changes don't amount to a total ban on VPNs. Use of state approved VPNs, which do everything except the useful stuff, remain legal. The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen's to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Eidos-Montréal and Black Forest Games, is set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive, according to a new Bloomberg report. Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. 
Once the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. 


Bloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. 
Saber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival.

We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren't likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they're still well worth covering. 
The subject of today's deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024.

        <updated>2024-02-29T19:10:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toys for Bob, the studio behind games like Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, has announced it is splitting from its owner Activision Blizzard to go independent. It is also exploring a partnership with Microsoft. 
Toys for Bob announced this in a statement released today, which explains why now is "the time to take the studio and our future games to the next level." 


Here's Toys for Bob's statement, in full: 
Toys for Bob did not disclose a price (if there is one) associated with its split from Activision Blizzard, which arrives just a few months after Microsoft purchased the company for a colossal $69 billion.
Toys for Bob joins another studio leaving the hands of its owner today: With a $500 million deal, Embracer Group has sold Saber Interactive to a group of private investors, as reported by Bloomberg. Kotaku is also reporting today that Gearbox, the makers of the Borderlands series, is looking to break away from Embracer Group as well. 
What kind of game do you hope Toys for Bob makes first? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocket Rat Games co-founder John Guerra remembers the exact day he started working on Cobalt Core's first prototype. He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. "I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core," he tells me.
The pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, "we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall," he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had "a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but "Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre," says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, "you can kind of see how that went from A to B".

I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.
This is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the "you're about to be unemployed" language right there. The company is moving away from "the development of future licensed IP" and toward "our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities". Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer's count) must go.

We don't know why this happened, or if developers at Square Enix and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio were in communication, or if scooters happen to be really popular in Japan right now – we don't know. One question we can answer, however, is which one is better?
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we put the two Segway-inspired scooters to the test side-by-side across a series of competitions and stunts to see which two-wheeled balancing vehicle is the best.

CEO Andrew Wilson issued a company-wide letter informing staff of the publisher's restructuring, which will mean sunsetting some live service titles and ceasing the development of certain projects.
In his letter, Wilson states that EA is restructuring to become more streamlined in order to deliver "deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere that build community, shape culture, and grow fandom." To that end, the company will be moving away from licensed IPs and shutting down certain titles to shift its development resources.

Taking place over multiple continents on the Planet (or Gaia as it was retroacively called) with various party members, a bunch of open-world areas, and lots of side activities and minigames to partake in, you're going to be playing this game for at least 50 to 60 hours before you roll credits (I reached the ending at 80 hours). 
When you've seen the story through, you might not be ready to hang up the ole' Buster Sword. Fortunately, Rebirth has New Game Plus. Well, kinda – it's complicated.

However, regardless of whether you're a long-time fan or not, one thing new to everyone playing Rebirth is Queen's Blood. 
Introduced early in Rebirth, Queen's Blood is an in-universe card game that seemingly everyone around Gaia's various continents plays, from Junon to Nibelheim and elsewhere. And after spending dozens of hours playing it, I can understand why - it rules.

I’m not a poker player. I’ve never learned the game, and my limited knowledge of it largely stems from pop culture osmosis, such as James Bond films and referential quips from X-Men’s Gambit. I couldn’t tell you what makes a Royal Flush, but I know it’s good to have it. Despite its premise and appearance, Balatro technically isn’t poker. It is, however, the first title to make me understand and enjoy the core premise of the card game. It also happens to be one of the most engrossing games of the year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could there be a more than universally relatable quote shared by indie developers than: "We really just wanted to make a small game"? Of course, there's little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.
Having said that, I’m not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, "something very fast". Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.

There might be fun in some of its slower moments, but some of the generally positive, "It's actually quite a good game!" takes that I've seen honestly baffle me. The game is a series of long, annoying journeys, during which the most fun I had was turning my head to watch Catfish on my other monitor. MTV's show about people getting duped online was the perfect sailing companion, and perhaps, one of the only reasons I survived my brush with the live service seas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given its zero-tolerance approach to piracy, Nintendo's copyright lawsuit targeting the company behind Switch emulator 'Yuzu' isn't a big surprise. While the 41-page complaint throws almost everything at the hugely popular Switch emulation project, Nintendo's focus on specific functionality plus knowledge, conduct, and intent, seems to avoid a direct assault on general emulation. It could cover the entire scene with banana peels, however.

To make that perhaps a little less daunting, Paradox have launched an optional monthly subscription service that gives you access to all the expansions. They've done this for several of their other grand strategy games before. It starts at £8.50 for one month then offers discounts for longer terms. While I can see niche uses for the option, I certainly wouldn't want to pay for this regularly. Would you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine has announced it is laying off 20 percent of its staff. In the statement announcing this news, Deck Nine didn't name a specific reason for the layoffs, instead stating the studio has been affected by the industry's worsening conditions. Twenty percent of Deck Nine's staff is equal to roughly 30 employees, according to a report from Eurogamer. 
Here's Deck Nine's statement, in full: 


Deck Nine game director Stephan Frost said on X (formerly Twitter) that leadership within the studio took pay cuts to keep the number of layoffs down as much as possible. "This is the strongest team [Deck Nine] has ever been and it absolutely sucks that the industry is in the state that it is presently," Frost adds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago on a desktop far, far away, my family once owned a demo disc for the original Star Wars: Dark Forces. I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).
Crucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.

DreadXP have shared a teaser consisting of some crackly logos against a backdrop of radio chatter. Given that this is a Paranormal Activity adaptation, it's possible the trailer harbours spooky secrets. You may wish to experiment with turning the brightness up and down, playing the video backwards, or watching it again at the next full moon, perhaps while standing in a cemetery loudly declaring that ghosts aren't real.

At times, it's a little too accurate, but even with its annoyances dialled up by the pressure of playing it too hard for the sake of review, I'm impressed with the balancing act it's struck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has marked the 8th birthday of his farming sim phenomenon baby (also called Stardew Valley) by announcing the impending release of update 1.6. The PC version - the one we care about - is arriving on the 19th of March, and consoles and mobile as soon as possible after that. The actual content of update 1.6 is largely a mystery, but Barone has teased a few things here and there, including that it's "mostly changers for modders" that'll make it "easier and more powerful to mod".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I seem to be on a highly irritating "refuse to play games as they were intended to be played" spree lately. A couple of weeks ago, it was "I refuse to leave the prologue area in Skull And Bones", a decision that has sadly been born out by Ed's review. Then it was "I refuse to play Helldivers 2 as a co-op shooter", which again, is a stance I am sticking with, even as I am overrun and sat on by Terminid Chargers. And now it's "I refuse to play Cobalt Core as a roguelike deck-builder, because it secretly isn't one". Come now, squint at the header image so that the text and numbers fade away, and all you can see are coloured shapes. Pay attention to certain underlying rhythms while playing. Need I say any more?

Last Saturday saw the most significant blunder, yet official explanations are notable only by their absence. In a letter to AGCOM dated Monday, ISP association ASSOProvider calls on the telecoms regulator to release specific documents to show what has been blocked since February 1, and effectively, who issued the order to block Cloudflare - and why..

New information shows that this was likely the result of a 'dynamic+ injunction', ordered by the High Court of Delhi, India on behalf of Netflix and the Hollywood majors. The order requires ISPs to block dozens of pirate sites and also applies to domain name registrars, including the American company Namecheap.

On Saturday, at least one Cloudflare IP address was added to the Piracy Shield anti-piracy system. According to an expert, that ended up blocking a large number of websites, including a charity, a telecoms company, and several schools. It's the outcome many people predicted but one that could've been easily avoided.

This is called “bus bunching,” and I bet you’ve seen it happen in OpenTTD – and not just with buses. For years, players have requested an easier way to keep vehicles with shared orders spaced out along their route. In OpenTTD 14, we’ve added one.]]></summary>

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.
