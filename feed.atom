It's ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it's invaluable.

The Labor Day sales are now on in North America, providing some select gaming bargains in North America. One deal that has really caught our eye (thanks, GamesRadar) is all about expanding the Switch OLED's memory capabilities, as Walmart is currently selling the console and a 128GB memory card for the same price as the system alone.
The bundle is currently assembled for $349.99, which gives you the Switch OLED and the additional memory card. You'd have to cough up $34.99 if you wanted to buy the Micro SD card alone, which isn't a bad little saving.

Whether that's a fair assessment or not, the fact is that a great many of us are looking to tighten our belts as the global cost-of-living crisis creeps into all aspects of our lives, and any household device that's constantly plugged into the mains is worth investigating to see what savings can be made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're not entirely sure that will work...
If you're even remotely present on the veritable hellscape that is Twitter, then you'll have no doubt seen a meme in which gamers take photos of their Switch console docked with a game disc from another platform resting on top; a metaphor of the user's desire to see a port of said game arrive on Switch.
Very droll, we're sure you'll agree, but ultimately a harmless way of inviting a few likes and retweets. But what if you tried it the other way around? Popping a Switch cart into the disc drive of a Wii U certainly sounds like a recipe for disaster, and unfortunately that's exactly what one owner in North America had to deal with after their son got his hands on both systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there's a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

After having a lot of fun with Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time when we reviewed the game last year, we have been eager to hear more news about the orange blur. An upcoming fan project from Unknown Door Games seems to do just that, though in a slightly less official release/full game kind of way.
Posting their progress on Twitter yesterday (thanks, Eurogamer), the developer announced that their fan-made title, Crash 'N' Dance, would be a remake of Crash Nitro Kart's secret Crash minigame 'Crash Party USA', something of a button-mashing/dance-mat/bandicoot hybrid that we never knew we needed.

Gearbox Software's upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won't have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

The Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 has been made available for pre-order in the UK and Europe, exclusively through Amazon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What a beautiful Duwang!
Anime games are in a weird spot. During the late '90s to mid-2000s we would get varied games like Berserk: Guts’ Rage, and Arc System Works’ Fist of the North Star. Aside from Dragon Ball — which in the last few years has gotten an RPG, 2D fighter, and even a Dead By Daylight clone — most anime series are relegated to 3D arena fighting games like My Hero: One’s Justice or the Attack On Titan duology.
Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is no different. Gone are the days of Capcom’s excellent 2D fighter Heritage for the Future, and Japan-only beat 'em up GioGio’s Bizarre Adventure; instead, console entries over the last decade have followed that same style with games like Eyes of Heaven and appearances in Shonen Jump crossover games like Jump Force. The one outsider was 2013’s All-Star Battle, which was a more traditional fighter. Nine years later, it makes its way to modern platforms in the form of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R, an updated entry that makes some good changes but ultimately doesn’t fix problems the initial game had.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games' Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

It's been a long time since we last heard news of Illumination's Mario movie. After taking the internet by storm with its, shall we say, interesting lead cast, we heard in April that the plumber's return to the big screen was to be pushed back to 2023. A cause for celebration for some, this release date delay might have been the perfect opportunity to provide some more information about the upcoming animated feature; but whenever we have gone looking for news it appears that all updates were moved to another castle.
That's until now (well, almost). As noted yesterday by @DespicableOutof on Twitter, the movie now has an initial listing on the Illumination Studios Paris website, meaning we might finally have an idea of what this 'Mario Movie' will be called. After months of fumbling around for the right answer - is it The Mario Movie? Super Mario? Crouching Plumber Hidden Bowser? - it seems that Illumination Studios has settled on a name, and what a board meeting it must have been to come up with this one.

As lifetime fans of the Turtles, we are hoping for this hot streak to continue long into the future, and a recent Nintendo Everything interview with Charles Murakami might be hinting at just that as the Konami senior producer spoke of the potential for a Cowabunga Collection-esque sequel down the pipeline.

The footage is from the PC release of the title, which is due to launch on October 21st, 2022 alongside the Nintendo Switch version. Clocking in at nearly 20 minutes, the gameplay features playable characters Anu, Octavio, and Fran as they sneak through the sewers of Promethea. The usual brand of Borderlands humour is on full display here, along with the familiar QTE and decision making mechanics that fans of the first game will be pleased to see return.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No lollygaggin' here, then.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and the Super Nintendo aren't two things we often put in the same conversation, but when 81monkeys Kickstarter project is involved, there's no better pairing or comparison. World of Anterra is a beautiful open-world RPG inspired by Bethesda's mammoth title, and it promises an "endlessly-explorable world" but in a rather lovely pixel form.
The game's Kickstarter launched a few weeks ago, and now the project is fully funded with (at the time of writing) 18 days to go, so there's still plenty of time to unlock stretch goals. Nicely, the developer says that everything it plans to put in World of Anterra will be in the game when it launches, so these goals won't be for new content or unlocking planned content, but rather some fun little backer rewards. The team has been hard at work on the game for over three years and is hoping to release the game on PC, Mac, and consoles in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than half of all boxed sales were on Nintendo's platform.
It's another new week and we have the latest UK charts for your perusal right here (you're welcome!). There are a few new additions to shake things up with Naughty Dog's The Last of Us: Part I coming in at pole position (despite, in our opinion, a pretty lofty asking price) along with F1 Manager 2022 entering the charts at number four.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection also makes its debut this week in third place. It's a respectable start for Konami's latest collection of classic titles, but what's more impressive is its performance on Nintendo's console specifically; Switch sales made up more than half of total boxed sales at 55%. PlayStation 5 followed up with 21%, then PlayStation 4 at 14%, and finally Xbox at 11%. It's important to remember, of course, that digital sales might paint a decidedly different picture, but it's certainly a strong start for the game on Switch.

We're celebrating Mother's Day this year in a very special way and looking back fondly on one particular Mother that Nintendo fans around the world are united in their adoration of — Shigesato Itoi's MOTHER series.

 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang's blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we've seen here at PAX so far.
If you've not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game's trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game's development. Watch it below:

Nám také a proto jsme vyzkoušeli software InvenTree včetně pluginu pro import z eshopů Ki-nTree. Na další Virtuální Bastlírně vám tak rádi ukážeme, jak z domácího chaosu udělat pořádek.

Co jsme ještě ve světě našli a o čem si můžeme popovídat? Že ESP32 s novou verzí SDK umí detekovat přítomnost lidí a jejich pohyb jen z diagnostických dat Wi-Fi? Jak se dělá NFC tag s e-ink displejem napájený čistě z NFC? A že pro odeslání UDP packetu na ethernetu potřebujete vlastně jen TX pin?

V záloze ještě máme vysvětlení funkce stojánků v McDonaldu a jak funguje jejich rádiová část. Ale ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete nám ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, rádi vás přivítáme na naší Virtuální Bastlírně - virtuálním setkání (nejen) ajťáků, bastlířů, elektroniků...

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 5. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

My experience with the PS2 version of Destroy All Humans 2 is rather limited. While I enjoyed the original back when it was released, I merely rented the sequel. Then my brother-in-law and I just messed around in co-op and I never made it anywhere. However, the fun with physics gameplay left such an impression on me that it’s been on my hit list for years. The problem is, the memory that stuck out most for me was its ugly-as-sin graphics and oppressive draw fog.
Thankfully, THQ Nordic and Black Forest Games decided to go all the way with the series and gussy up Destroy All Humans 2 in the same way it did for the original title. That means, while the graphics have been upgraded to the nines, the warts of the PS2-era gameplay are still present underneath. …]]></summary>

Set in a dystopian future straight out of the cocaine haze of the 1970s, Rollerdrome takes two of gaming’s most cherished pastimes—pulling off sick combos and murder—and mashes them up into an audacious spectacle that is definitely not Norman Jewison’s Rollerball. Taking control of mysterious rookie Kara Hassan, it’s skate or die for players as you’ll have to grab, grind, flip and twist your way to high-score combos while gunning down enemies hellbent on stopping you. Kara clearly has the skills to be the next Rollerdrome champion, but with the corporation behind the sport plotting against her, she’ll have to use every trick in the book to survive.

Before I even started playing Cult of the Lamb, I knew I was going to love it. First off, we've got the cute art style going on, so that box was ticked immediately. Plus the conceit of a simulator about running your own cult is hilarious and fresh in its own way.
I think us roguelike and simulator fans can agree that both genres are having something of a renaissance right now, and Cult of the Lamb manages to hit every note in perfect harmony. Now maybe it's the antidepressants talking, but playing through it has been some of the most fun I've had with a game all year.
Part of the worry with having a game with so many different elements is that the player could start to feel overwhelmed — the base-building sim, the punchy roguelike gameplay, the …]]></summary>

There's always a Switch rumour these days. When it's not "new Metroid", it's "Switch Pro"; when it's not either of those, it's "Zelda remakes". The latest rumour is a Nintendo Direct focused on Zelda ports, and maybe a Metroid, which means chances are high that it's actually about the Switch Pro, right?
Now, we're pretty hyped about the possibility of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess on the Switch, even as we scowl at Nintendo for making it so hard to play those games any other way, and presumably (if the rumours are true) making us pay full price for each one again. We know we're not alone, too — the social media hype is pretty real right now.

Remember Jeff Minter? Both Perpetuum Mobile and Super Space Serpent SE are heavily inspired by the likes of Tempest and Polybius, and this is no bad thing. There’s always room for more wireframe, purple, and nice liquid trance beats in the gaming world.
Although Perpetuum Mobile sounds like an iPhone game, it’s actually a music-related term describing “entire musical compositions or passages within them that are characterised by a continuous stream of notes”. So there you go. It’s also a video game that originally came out on PC, Xbox One, and Oculus Rift as a VR experience last year. Both games in this bundle are scoring games, and this is the simpler of the two: a procedurally generated, 3D endless runner where you head into the screen, laser auto-firing, destroying and dodging incoming obstacles. You can grab health icons to keep you in the game, and new enemies are introduced as you perpetually increase your speed. You can only move left and right, and there are no buttons to press, making it a pretty basic affair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's PAX West interview is with the one and only Ron Gilbert, series creator of the iconic point-and-click adventure series, Monkey Island. We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island's world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game's story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won't wanna miss that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blast back to the '90s in a tale of pop and romance
A new kind of love story is headed to Steam, with a musical twist. Riley & Rochelle is an upcoming new mystery from Sheinman Games that sees you untangling the relationship of two musicians.
Riley and Rochelle are two artists from different worlds, who wind up falling in and out of love in the '90s. Hailing from Detroit is Riley Stone, a rocker who came up through the indie music scene. Meanwhile Rochelle Robert is a former child pageant star who gets discovered and makes her way into the spotlight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5LO9H8YCfM
The two collide and grow closer, and it's your job to figure out how, why, and what happened after. Riley & Rochelle lets you piece together music, journal entries, and information to figure out the story. Maybe, even, whether anyone gets a decent ending.
The game is a collaboration between Tim Sheinman and Natalia Yanchak, with art from Mack Chater, Murray Somerwolff, and Josiah Whitfield. And the Sheinman Games label is what caught my eye about this in the first place.

He was a boy, she was a girl
Sheinman has made several investigation-centric games in the past. One in particular I dug was Rivals, a similar mix of music and detective work that had the player piece together the history of a band and its falling out.
Just the general idea of pulling together scraps of info for a VH1's Behind The Music style program is interesting enough. But the music here is spot-on, too. A clever mix of information hunting and good tunes makes for a pretty unique style of detective game.
Riley & Rochelle is currently aiming for a launch on PC and Mac. You can head on over and wishlist it on Steam at this link.

Ever since Paradox Interactive announced Victoria 3, I've been in a state of semi-disbelief. It was a strategy game in-joke for so long that I couldn't believe it was really happening. I was provided a preview build of the upcoming socio-economic grand strategy game thanks to Paradox. To quote Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles, it's "real, and it's fantastic." And soon, you too can politick to your heart's content when the game releases on October 25, 2022.
For those of you present who aren't cool enough to know what the Victoria series is all about, an introduction is in order. Victoria is a grand strategy game series aptly set during the Victorian era. Whereas other entries in the Paradox family of grand strategy games focus on war or lineage,…]]></summary>

Released to the arcade market in the summer of 1983, Pac & Pal is the third mainline entry in Bandai Namco's in-house Pac-Man series, and sees the puck-shaped protagonist return to his maze-chasing origins. In Pac & Pal, Pac-Man must once again gobble up power pellets and items of fruit strewn around a series of mazes, while staying one step ahead of returning ghosts Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde.

By the time I knew something was up with Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid's latest FMV mystery, I had already ripped open Pandora's Box. I just didn't know it yet. Little hints and bread crumbs were laying there. Percolating theories were just waiting to be blown open to something big. And I just kept tugging at the threads.
Immortality is the latest game from Barlow and co., and it sees Barlow returning to full-motion video similar to Her Story and Telling Lies. The most obvious difference is how the experience itself handles; rather than typing queries into a database, you have a reel setup similar to a classic Moviola machine and a crosshair.

This time though, you'll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

This is a huge amount of storage, ideal for archiving games and storing media like music and video, and well worth considering especially if your boot SSD is getting full. By comparison, the cheapest 8TB SSD is £669, making this more than four times cheaper.

Happy Friday! Tonight we've got a request from the community for a scary game called The Bridge Curse: Road to Salvation. If you were here a few months back when we scoped out a similar Indonesian folklore horror game, Pamali, you'll see some similarities with this one as it features Taiwanese folklore instead. You know we love all that good spooky stuff!

I'm extra excited that Halloween is finally back on the horizon, too, so let me know all the horror games you want to see over the coming weeks. Drop into the stream tonight to test this one out with us! It's super highly rated on Steam despite being a newer niche pick, but that's perfect. See you there!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

God of War Ragnarok is on its way, with some all-new battles for Kratos and his son Atreus to wind up in. Today, we got a quick hit of some combat, showing off new moves Kratos will have in November.
As part of Game Informer's cover story for Ragnarok, the team has already talked about changes coming to Kratos' arsenal. Today's video shows just what that looks like in action. We see him running around an arena, beating the daylights out of some merfolk-looking enemies.
A key component of Kratos' move set, as the video describes, is the idea of playing with your food. The god of war can really send enemies flying and bouncing around, as well as employ some elemental moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QZhk4w66_8
These elemental moves are part of a new system for Kratos' weapons. The Leviathan Axe can bring out frost magic, while the Blades of Chaos elicit fire. By holding or mashing the Triangle button, the weapons become infused with the elements, doing extra damage to enemies.
He's really in his element here
It's a quick little burst of gameplay, with the video coming in at under two minutes. Still, it's nice to see some gameplay of God of War Ragnarok. I've been curious as to how different the combat would feel in Ragnarok versus the 2018 iteration. Seems like Sony Santa Monica Studios have found some ways of adding on top of what was already a pretty solid set of mechanics.
The written portion of Game Informer's cover story also talks about the shields, both the Dauntless and Stonewall versions, as well as some other granular bits of gameplay detail. It might still seem far away, but November is inching ever closer. And with it, plenty more enemies for Kratos to smash apart.

A bundle of trouble is headed to Warner Bros. Games crossover fighter MultiVersus in just a few short days, as developer Player First Games has dropped a new teaser trailer that points to the arrival of Gizmo, the heroic little Mogwai from Joe Dante's 1984 hit, Gremlins.
A short teaser video sees the ancient, ornate chest that is Gizmo's home open up in response to the sound of cavorting mayhem, suggesting that the sweet lol' fuzzball is headed to MultiVersus in order to keep his arch nemesis, Stripe, in line. While details on Gizmo are very sparse at the time of writing, it is believed that he will be an individual character from Stripe, with his own moveset and abilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clear space on the shelf, you're gonna need it
Elden Ring is a massive game -- not only in its sprawling map that provides hundreds of hours of gameplay, but also in the cultural impact it's had in games this year. It's fitting, then, that FromSoft is releasing an equally massive two-volume art book collection (via PC Gamer), each of which is 400 pages long. They've released a book of concept art for every game since Dark Souls, but this will be the longest one in the collection by far.
Volume 1 will focus on the art of locations, NPCs, and armor, and Volume 2 will feature enemies, weapons, and items. The books are available to purchase individually for $31 each, or if you're an Elden Ring superfan, you can buy the set in the Ultra Edition, which retails for $125 and comes with a box to house the books, as well as a framed art print featuring everyone's favorite boss, Godfrey.
The Elden Ring art books are out on November 30 in Japan, and while we don't have a release date for other regions just yet, it can't be too far behind.

Something else to look forward to are the interviews with the Elden Ring design team, including director Hidetaka Miyazaki, that are a staple of the books.
We haven't had those interviews officially confirmed for the Elden Ring books, but they've always been a staple, so it would be a surprise if they weren't included. Because the FromSoft art books have been such a tradition, a lot of the unknown info feels more like a "when" rather than an "if."
While I don't have any of the Soulsborne art books yet myself, I do have plenty of others. Art in games is always so unique, plus it's cool to see how elements like characters and environments have evolved over the course of a game's development.
Considering Elden Ring has one of the most beautiful open worlds in games, it's pretty much a guarantee that this is gonna be a must-have for art book collectors.

        <updated>2022-09-02T22:16:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Splitgate, the sci-fi multiplayer shooter with portals, received some bittersweet news today. Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.
1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. 
As such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. 
You can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):
Splitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.]]></summary>

Mortality is the common experience. We all face the possibility of death at any moment. We know our lives are finite, possibly meaningless. Whether you’re rich, poor, classy, slovenly, hard-working, lazy, smart, daft, sexy, smelly, a game developer, a game critic, or worse, we all get there in the end. We all have different ways of coping with it. Humor is one such method and the one I prefer to lean on, even though I’m about as funny as a clown giving a eulogy. Humor is how I bury all my emotions. It’s how I hide my relentless misery and the sheer struggle it is to keep putting one foot in front of the other. Like I said: clown at a funeral.

While the retro-focused Evercade systems are known for their (officially licensed) game cartridges, there's an interesting wrinkle with the upcoming Evercade EXP handheld — it's bundling a coveted selection of Capcom games that won't be available on a cart.
And it's not just some random titles from Capcom's stretched-out catalog, either.
When the Evercade EXP releases later this year (on November 24, with pre-orders opening on September 6), it will come with games like Bionic Commando, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Strider, Mega Man X, and Breath of Fire directly built-in. There are 18 titles altogether.

I've played a lot of The Last of Us in my life. The first one was incredibly formative for me, and became the reason I work in games now. My hyperfixation with it took over my life for a good year, and in that time I ended up playing it seven or eight times, starting it over again after I finished it. My love for TLOU is what brought me across the country to live in Los Angeles, and eventually landed me a job at Naughty Dog doing QA for The Last of Us Part II, which I platinumed about a half dozen times while I worked there.
The series has continued to be at the forefront of the games industry nearly a decade after its beginnings, for better and for worse. The first game is one of the best examples of interactive storytelling we have, and certainly my favorite, and I have …]]></summary>

Ash's Gengar is now in the mix, thanks to a new distribution event from The Pokemon Company for Pokemon Sword and Shield.
The code was revealed through an episode of the Pokemon TV show in Japan, but the distribution is taking place worldwide. It'll last from now through September 15 and again, it's a part of Sword and Shield (it doesn't extend to Diamond or Pearl remakes like a few other distributions this year). You just need to select the mystery gift portion of the menu (which you'll unlock in the first few hours) and enter the code below. It's essentially just a bonus Gengar, but it contains Ash's trainer ID (named Satoshi in Japan), and a moveset that Ash utilizes in the TV show.
We’ve been saying it for a little while now, but this could be one of the final distribution events for Sword and Shield as the door closes on that generation. Scarlet and Violet will take over later in 2022, and although there should be a few initial Sword and Shield distribution events, everything will cycle to the newest gen sometime in 2023. It's how things go!

Awaceb's action-adventure game Tchia has a pretty cool set of tools for getting around its world. In a new gameplay walkthrough, we got a good glimpse at all the ways players will be able to get around and use their powers.
Tchia is a new open-world adventure following protagonist Tchia. She's on a quest to rescue her father, and she'll need the help of both her tools and some impressive soul powers to do it.
A big feature of Tchia is being able to inhabit things, be they birds, lanterns, or fruits, and use them for different effects. As shown in this new gameplay walkthrough with game director Phil Crifo, there's a lot to do with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri2OiksaV88
Early on, Tchia inhabits a bird and soars around, providing a good view. Later, Tchia jumps into a lantern and flings it at an enemy, lighting them on fire. Rad! Crifo even shows off soul jumping into a coconut.
You might wonder why anyone would soul jump into a coconut. Well, Crifo shows how throwing an object with the throw mechanic, then leaping into it to gain momentum. It makes me think speedruns for this could be really interesting.
Hey, soul sister
The walkthrough shows off a bunch of ways for getting around the island, from tree-hopping to sailing. And it caps off with a little ditty with one of Tchia's pals, using the fully playable ukulele. No, they do not play Wonderwall.

Tchia has looked pretty rad so far in its showings, mixing open-world action-adventure mechanics with a gorgeous island world inspired by New Caledonia. While it got a delay earlier this year that's pushed it into 2023, I'm really intrigued to see more of this world and what players can discover in it. The soul jumping alone seems like an incredibly fun mechanic to mess around with once Tchia is out.

In case you missed it, Splatoon 3's Salmon Run PVE/horde mode is always going to be on. No wonky "sign on during this time/date" restrictions: you just queue up for a multiplayer mode and you play it! It only took a sequel for it to happen.
We've known that for some time now, but a tweet today reconfirmed that it is indeed available "24/7," in a bid to reach the "Eggsecutive VP" level. It looks like a ranking (it's shown in the top right-hand corner of the image, complete with an experience bar), and part of a separate XP system. In the past, Salmon Run was essentially playable every other day or so, rotating into Splatoon 2 as a game mode.
Nintendo doles out more info on Splatoon 3's Salmon Run
Nintendo also took the time this morning to talk about a few other aspects of the game, including the break room, which is essentially a training room for Salmon Run. Just like folks experienced in the Splatfest, it looks like you'll be able to practice some basics before a mission. You can try out egg throws here, as well as weaponry. Private games are also confirmed, and Nintendo reminds us that "King Salmonids" could appear in the mode.
All good stuff so far! I mean they had me at "Salmon Run is always on."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new project will be built in Unreal Engine 5
Developer 1047 Games is moving on to a new project. The studio announced today that it is ending feature development on its portal-based shooter Splitgate, and moving on to a new game.
In a new statement shared on the Splitgate site, 1047 says that the FPS has reached a level of success it could not have anticipated. This has led to the studio growing substantially and bringing on new talent. It's also meant a lot of time trying to rework older content and systems, in what it characterizes as "bailing water" from a ship.
In light of this, 1047 Games has decided to build something new. And to do so, it's ending feature development on Splitgate.
"We’re turning our attention away from iterative, smaller updates and going all-in to focus on a new game in the Splitgate universe which will present revolutionary, not evolutionary, changes to our game. It will be a shooter, it will have portals, and it will be built in Unreal Engine 5. Oh, and it will be free."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5XKcTM_NM8
A portal to a new world
That doesn't mean Splitgate is going away, though. 1047 Games says Splitgate will remain online, as will items and progression. There's also a new Battle Pass rolling out on September 15. The pass will be free for everyone, as a thank-you to everyone who's played Splitgate.
Support will also continue, though it will be limited in scope to smaller updates and fixes. The bulk of 1047's focus, the studio says, will be on an entirely new shooter.
Splitgate started out as an interesting combination of Portal and Halo, which worked pretty well at the time for those waiting on Halo Infinite. It's since grown to be its own thing, and it'll be interesting to see what 1047 does with a new engine, larger team, and all the lessons learned from making Splitgate.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We wished it to happen, and it was so
Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel is chugging along since it launched just nine days ago, and now he's amassed nearly one million subscribers already.
Having watched every video so far, it's easy to see why! Sakurai is essentially bringing a game development boot camp to the masses, with his signature calm and easy-going approach. He's touched on topics such as accessibility, technical considerations, design mechanics, and game philosophy.
At the time of publication, here is how his YouTube situation is going:
405,000 English language subscribers
355,000 Japanese language subscribers
Below are a few of the videos Sakurai's YouTube channel has shared since our last update. I've been checking back in daily! The bite-sized format is such a great way to end the day.
Risk and Reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqEykD5Ub4
In this video, Sakurai uses the ever-popular game Space Invaders to illustrate the concept of risk and reward, and how a careful balance of both can lead to a more engaging experience.
Game Development Isn't a Game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlFkxfkICO8
In the vein of many, many GDC and DICE-esque talks (albeit with his signature light touch), Sakurai warns folks that making games isn't always fun and games.
Down with Lag!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoKKyskco4
In a segment called "grab bag," Sakurai talks about miscellaneous topics: this one deals with response time and input delay in a more digestible, less technical format. It also has a nice little anecdote about how he was shocked at the amount of lag during a live Nintendo game demonstration!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The City of Steel
Fallout 76 Season 10 has been revealed, and it'll debut alongside the massive upcoming update for The Pitt on September 13.
As usual, the "seasonal" approach is mostly a high-level aesthetic sheen on the modern season pass, complete with a reward track. Bethesda says this will be the "first time ever" that you can unlock gear crafting recipes, which is sure to ruffle some feathers. For the most part though, Season 10 is business as usual. The 100-ish rank system is still in place, but this time the rewards are themed around the rust-filled Pitt locale.
Here's the full description from the team:
"Enjoy the city of the future, brought to you by Red Rocket, as you accrue S.C.O.R.E. and progress through 100 ranks of rewards. Unlock new gear and cosmetics as well as tons of currency to spend, including Atoms, Caps and even Stamps to trade for new Expedition-related goods. Fallout 1st members can unlock even more in Season 10, including exclusive rewards and even bonus S.C.O.R.E. boosts that last throughout the Season for active members!"

While the setup isn't that exciting, it does come with the Pitt update itself, which can be played while ignoring the season pass system wholesale. And of course, playing it at any point after the addition of The Pitt will include all of the iterative content released so far after the underwhelming launch. For folks that have avoided it thus far: the prospect of randomly playing it on Game Pass one weekend keeps getting more enticing.
Here's the full schedule for the Fallout 76 Season 10 lead-in, as well as beyond:
September 1 – 6: Scrip Surplus Weekend
September 8 – 12: Legendary Purveyor Sale (up to 25% off) AND Double Mutations Weekend
September 13: The Pitt & Season 10 launch
September 22 – 26: Double Mutations Weekend
September 29 – October 3: Scrip Surplus Weekend, Gold Rush Weekend, AND Minerva’s Big Sale

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game's early missions, I can genuinely say that I'd be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I'd genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey "retro" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Step 1: Go Fast - Step 2: Actually understand what you're buying
The initial rollout of Sonic Frontiers information was messy, to say the least. After a series of confusing videos that didn't exactly showcase the game in the best light, we finally got a look at Cyber Space, and a glimpse into the narrative. This Sonic Frontiers overview trailer (which reiterates the November 8 release date) basically compiles all of that into one digestible package.
Clocking in at roughly three minutes, this new video from the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube account is actually pretty helpful! It starts at the literal beginning, with Sonic, Amy, and Tails chilling, before they're "sucked into a dimensional portal to Cyber Space, then ends up on the Starfall Islands." It then moves into a mechanical perspective, talking up its open world (which it calls "open-zone platforming") and "the freedom to play the game in the order that matches your playstyle." A slight overview of the combat system and in-game puzzles are also touched on.
There's also a crucial part that actually talks about how critical path story progress is made. You'll defeat bosses to earn "Portal Gears," which in turn unlock Cyber Space stages. Once you finish challenges therein, you'll then earn keys that can be used to unlock Chaos Emerald vaults to "progress farther in the game." That seems to be the loop!
Hopefully that can last for —I'm going to guess — 10-15 hours, and beyond? Either way, they should have led with some of these videos (especially Cyber Space) out of the gate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unearthed Treasure
Tokyo Game Show is yet to officially get underway, but already it seems that some of its surprises are just too durn exciting to keep under wraps. According to a new leak uncovered by Gematsu, legendary shmup developer Treasure is getting set to reveal a new project under the banner of one of its best-loved IPs, Radiant Silvergun.
Gematsu found evidence of a new Radiant Silvergun title after poking around the TGS website uploaded by publisher Happinet. Alongside assets and titles pulled from over 30 franchises was a brand new logo simply depicting "Radiant Silvergun," complete with a silhouette of the game's iconic starship. Treasure, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, will apparently be showcasing the new title at this year's TGS, which will no doubt get retro game fans and shmup aficionados into a suitable tizzy.
Radiant Silvergun was released in Japanese arcades in May 1998, before finding its way onto the Sega Saturn in the console's twilight years. For the longest of times, it would remain something of an urban legend among western players, available only via expensive imports and poor early-day emulation. The classy shmup would eventually be ported to Xbox 360 in 2011, which represented the title's first, readily available, global release. Today, Radiant Silvergun still stands proud, holding a deserved reputation as a genuine classic of the genre.
What form this project will take remains to be seen, but I would think a remaster or remake is more likely than a sequel. In either case, we won't have to wait too much longer to find out, as Tokyo Game Show will kick off September 15, emanating from Chiba's Makuhari Messe complex. We will bring you all of the details from Radiant Silvergun (and many other TGS exclusives) right here on Destructoid.

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll take a gamble on it
Mario Kart Tour gacha is no more, at least come "late September," according to a new update from the game's official Twitter account.
Here's the full rundown:
"Here's a peek at #MarioKartTour's update coming late September! Battle mode will be added, along with a Spotlight Shop, where you can exchange rubies for drivers, karts, and gliders! Also, pipes you can fire by using rubies will be removed. See the notification for details."

So checking out that notification on the app, it seems as if "new drivers, karts, and gliders, as well as drivers, karts, and gliders that have appeared in the past, will be available." This "Spotlight Shop" system will likely work similarly to the Fornite (and company) spotlight shops, which only showcase a few things to buy at a time, in a bid to get you to keep checking out the storefront and buy something before it leaves. The in-game update also says "lots of other things are in the works too."
Obviously, a lot of games still have gacha elements, and clearly (in addition to this primarily being a business decision rather than some gift on high) this helps Nintendo enter into markets that don't currently allow it. But for folks who didn't like the gambling element of Mario Kart Tour gacha, it's a win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR's version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be "about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what's next for Cyberpunk 2077."
Choooom! There's something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!
#Edgerunners and what's next for #Cyberpunk2077. 🔥

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

        <updated>2022-09-02T12:20:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: 

For more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inti Creates have earned themselves a reputation in recent years, through titles like Blaster Master Zero and the Azure Striker Gunvolt series, of creating visually-intricate and technical 2D platformers. Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don't have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

Basically, she got one of those at-home dance pads you use for games like Dance Dance Revolution and hooked it up to Elden Ring, which is already a funny enough concept on its own. What's even more impressive, then, is that she's already beaten five of the game's bosses to date (thanks, Eurogamer), and she isn't stopping there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real and we'll be learning more about it next week.
That's because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we'll learn more about the future of Assassin's Creed and more. It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. 
Assassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.

September 1, 2022
If rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer. 
Are you excited about Mirage? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Online Campaign Co-Op
The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

So, at this year's Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios' chief technology officer Mark James about what I'd seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.

        <updated>2022-09-01T15:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest.

That’s where I come in. I’ve spent many hours playing the final version of the game, and I’d like to offer some helpful tips to make your early hours in Badgetown as enjoyable and efficient as possible.

Sadly, the sequel has been delayed again, but the devs seem confident in the horror survival game's early 2023 release period.  
Hey Everyone,

August 31, 2022
Endnight Games' post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team's hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio's most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape. It looks to be even more brutal and terrifying than the last game, and I can't wait to get my hands on it. 
Sons of the Forest splatters onto our screens next year, February 23, for PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.


At the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as "Project Code Name 'M'" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were high expectations going into Buried Memory, patch 6.2 for Final Fantasy XIV - new raids, new story, and, most importantly, a new mode called Island Sanctuary to fulfil all of your farming dreams. There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.


Meant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this segment of New Gameplay Today, your host, Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc, walks you through how Saturnalia works as both a survival horror game and a roguelike. In it, you'll see him control Anita, one of the game's many playable characters, as she searches for her partner in the small town of Sardinia, Italy.
Unfortunately for Anita, it's not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening. That translates to a terrifying creature that stalks Anita and others through the darkness of the night and you must avoid it all while remaining alive as you search for clues to end this night of terror and misery. 
In the New Gameplay Today segment below, we have more than 15 minutes of brand-new Saturnalia footage to showcase. Enjoy!


Saturnalia is being developed and published by Santa Ragione. It's due out on PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime this year. For more, check out the Saturnalia reveal trailer.]]></summary>

Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I'm unsure whether it'll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. "I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past," he tells me. "This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017." And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

In 2013, I was 19 and still practicing the unfortunate act of pre-ordering video games before I knew if they were good or not. As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could've hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don't think that's true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy's The Road, No Country F…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stranded: Alien Dawn is Haemimont Games’ second sci-fi sim on the trot, and despite being set on a planet that actually has air this time, it could well make Surviving Mars’ well-funded colony building feel like an afternoon playing with Lego. In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.


“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim.

Just today, Chinese developer-publisher NetEase announced it was acquiring Detroit: Become Human dev Quantic Dream, and now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent have increased their stakes in From Software, the prolific developer behind the Dark Souls series and this year’s mega-hit, Elden Ring. 
This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantic Dream, the developer behind games like Detroit: Become Human and Heavy Rain, has been acquired by NetEase Game, one of China’s largest video game companies whose catalog of games developed and published include Knives Out, Naraka Bladepoint, and more. 
This news comes from a posting released by NetEase today that calls Quantic Dream its first studio in Europe. It’s unclear how much the acquisition cost NetEase, but the developer-publisher says it will allow the studio to continue to operate independently, focusing on creating and publishing games while supporting third-party developed titles too. 


“We are thrilled to embark on an exciting new stage of growth with Quantic Dream, bound by our shared vision, mutual trust, and respect,” CEO and director of NetEase William Ding writes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went into my High On Life hands-on session with one expectation: its talking alien guns will annoy the heck out of me. But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne's multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.
And most importantly, the guns didn't annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I've played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you're a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games' back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.

“That’s an internal philosophy that we’ve had since back in the day,” Sheth says. “Kratos plays with his food. We tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, ‘We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.’ That’s been the guiding principle more than anything else.”

More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What's more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It'll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


"When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight's peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them," a press release reads. "But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist."
"Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure." 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

Other times, it all goes to pot and you get absolutely walloped, but hot damn if you didn't go down fighting. ORX has these moments in spades. Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It's a gripping mix that's already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it's a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While mooching around Samsung’s Gamescom booth, waiting for their 990 Pro SSD reveal, I took the opportunity to play with an altogether more unusual addition to their hardware catalogue. The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. 


I actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.

At the time the project was being referred to as Rift, but multiple sources are now saying the game will be called Assassin’s Creed: Mirage. Both Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb say they’ve been told by people familiar with the game that Mirage is accurate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to level with you: I'm not a GSG player. I play strategy, sure, but grand strategy has always been a bit beyond me. I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.
I'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the games I saw at this year's Gamescom, sci-fi team-based shooter Hyenas easily claims the title of "Most Confusing Overall Experience". Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I'd eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.
I sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it's very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drumroll, please, for the latest interactive, live action, film archival puzzle from Sam Barlow, of Her Story and Telling Lies. This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?
In typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.
Now. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.]]></summary>

Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

        <updated>2022-08-29T13:06:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

This new division will operate independently from PlayStation’s console development and instead focus on creating “innovative, on-the-go experiences based on new and existing PlayStation IP,” according to a PlayStation Blog post. Savage Game Studios is one of the first studios to join this new division, and PlayStation says the Savage team is working on a “new unannounced AAA mobile live service action game.”

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years. That’s a bit how I feel about the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games. I can recall with crystal clarity being gathered around a TMNT arcade cabinet with my friends, pumping in tokens to try and beat Shredder before the birthday party ended. Or spending a weekend banging my head against the wall of the first NES game and its absurd sewer challenges. The Cowabunga Collection exists to service the nostalgic recollection of these types of experiences, and it does so with aplomb. Are these truly great games worth …]]></summary>

You’ve likely heard of Lies Of P after it took the internet by storm after Gamescom Opening Night Live. If you haven’t, I’ll quickly catch you up to speed: it’s a Pinocchio-themed Soulsborne.
You play as the iconic marionette fighting to become human in a fictional French city inspired by the historic Belle Époque era – a time of abundant affluence for the country. Familiar characters like Geppetto, Pinnochio’s creator and father figure, and Gemini Cricket help familiarize the story, but Lies Of P promises intriguing twists through a dark reimagining.

Endless Dungeon, the successor to 2014’s Dungeon of The Endless, is a tower defense twin-stick shooter created by French developer Amplitude Studios; and after my hands-on session at Gamescom 2022, it has the potential to be the next big roguelite. 
Interestingly, this upcoming roguelite is more a reimagining than a sequel. Instead of the point-and-click navigation and automated combat featured in the first game, players now directly control characters and weapons in real-time. Endless Dungeon reimagines its predecessor’s pixel art dungeons into larger, gorgeously-lit 3D spaces. Also, up t…]]></summary>

Nero reprises his starring role, but he's joined by Dante and mysterious newcomer V. The three demon slayers, alongside familiar allies, unite to combat a powerful demon lord. Longtime DMC director Hideaki Itsuno wanted to hit a "homerun" with the title after realizing he may not have many games left in him, so he went all out. That includes adopting Capcom's…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.
Frozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. 


On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a hot minute since I last crossed paths with JRPG series Wild Arms and Shadow Hearts, but today the key creators behind both of these late 90s and early 00s RPGs have announced they're making two brand-new JRPGs that are inspired by their previous works - and they're launching a 'double Kickstarter' campaign to help fund them. The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who's making what), and based on what I've seen so far, I'm intrigued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The WD Black SN770 is a good middle-of-the-road PCIe 4.0 SSD, outperforming PCIe 3.0 SSDs while costing less than the very fastest PCIe 4.0 models. It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.
Let's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wouldn't be Gamescom without a Geoff Keighley liveshow to kick it all off, would it? Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.


You'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.


Much like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you'd expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio's previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you'll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck is a brilliant system, but its internal storage is limited - from anywhere from 64GB to 512GB depending on the model you chose. Thankfully, Micro SD cards are getting extremely affordable, even in massive sizes all the way up to 1TB. Smaller sizes like 256GB and 512GB are better value per gigabyte, but today in the UK there's been a big discount on a 1TB Lexar Play Micro SD card that brings it into contention too. 
The Lexar Play 1TB is now retailing for £110 at Amazon, compared to a usual price of £140. If you'd prefer something a little more high performance, the highly-rated SanDisk Extreme 1TB card is also on sale, dropping from £220 to £140.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has "no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

But despite both of these events, it's been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is. Aside from being a real-time strategy spin-off, there's been nothing else to scan with our eyeballs for more info.
Colour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year's Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay. I can now report that what Minecraft Legends appears to be is as mix of real-time strategy and building, made all the more approachable by being set in Minecraft's colourful cube-verse.

Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.
So going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.

Netflix have also hired screenwriter Michael Green for the BioShock flick. Green wrote the Kenneth Branagh versions of Agatha Christie’s Murder On The Orient Express and Death On The Nile. I guess that means he’s got experience of period settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's late on a Thursday afternoon. It's time for a break. Let's finally getting back to our Gundam streams. We're going live over on our Twitch channel to build the Master Grade Tallgeese from Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. 
Join us at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT) to watch the build. We likely won't get through the whole thing today, but we'll be live for at least a couple of hours. 
And as you might've guessed from the picture above, we have a lot more Gunpla kits to get through. Bandai was nice enough to send us a few, and we'll absolutely be live streaming lots of fun hobby-adjacent activities over the next few weeks.
 Again, we're going live on our Twitch channel at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT). Hope to see you there!]]></summary>

The card in question is a PowerColor Fighter model, with a simple two-fan design that should be more than capable of dealing with this mid-range card's modest 175W TDP.

Netflix revealed in a tweet made today that Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) will direct this BioShock film adaptation and Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) will write the script.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.]]></summary>

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

Attackers "executed arbitrary code on a remote device, meaning they could take control of a player's PC." But thankfully, seven months later, the servers are back online. 
The official Dark Souls Twitter account initially confirmed servers would remain offline beyond the release of Elden Ring. However, the extensive deactivation period that ensued couldn't have been anticipated. The RCE hack affected all three Dark Souls games. And now that the third entry's multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too.

The Devil In Me stars actor Jessie Buckley and follows a group of filmmakers fighting for survival in a dangerous house, a replica of H.H. Holmes’ infamous “Murder Castle.” The new trailer runs down additions such as being able to use important tools from a character inventory and extended exploration mechanics; players can freely run, jump, and climb now. Supermassive also reveals the story is over seven hours long. An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer.

First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. 
The story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in.

I love Minecraft and have been playing it on and off since it landed on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012, but I couldn’t care less about the series’ spin-off games like Dungeons or the Telltale-developed Story Mode. While those games were fine, they defeated the point of why I love Minecraft – building, and crafting. 
Developer Mojang Studios is shaking things up with its next spin-off, and after my behind-closed-doors demo at Gamescom, I’m interested. 


Minecraft Legends is a third-person real-time action strategy game. Yeah, that’s a lot of keywords, but I promise the game is easier to understand than you think…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
