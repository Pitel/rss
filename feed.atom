        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo creators 343 Industries are having a bit of a glow-up. They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those dril tweets about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

Those requirements have since lowered and risen, and now we know for sure that nu-Silent Hill 2 is one tough customer for performance – albeit one that benefits greatly from just one or two key settings tweaks.

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game makes its debut this week, but perhaps not in the way Outright Games was hoping for - the licensed title comes in right near the bottom at number 39. The PS5's remaster of Until Dawn performed a bit better, however, and managed to nab the 14th spot in its debut week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uploaded on Saturday, a Final Fantasy VII Rebirth FF16 mod has given Cloud Strife Clive's outfit. Aerith has also received Jill's look from Final Fantasy 16. 


The mod is by Trivia3D, a talented modder on Patreon who provides the heroes of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth amazing designs like wearing a chocobo hoodie and a citric-themed dress for Aerith. You can download the Cloud Strife Clive outfit here if you'd like. Here is Jill's outfit on Aerith, which was posted on Sunday. The tweet that shows the FF 16 protagonist design for Cloud has received over 2,300 likes on X and counting. 


The German voice for Clive Vincent Fallow hilariously replied to the post, "Cloud finally got drip," 




Hopefully, we can see Clive Rosfield wearing Cloud's look from the Final Fantasy VII series in a future update. Fingers crossed. We'll likely see more mods for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth if and when the game launches on PC. It's currently a PS5 exclusive and has underperformed sales-wise for its publisher Square Enix. 


According to Square Enix President Takashi Kiryu (via Bloomberg), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Final Fantasy XVI, and Foamstars all "fell short of the Japanese game publisher’s expectations in both revenue and profit." Square Enix shares as a result fell 16% in May.


Despite reportedly poor sales, there's much fan support for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI. In fact, it was nominated for Console Game of the Year at The Golden Joystick Awards. With the critical acclaim this game received, it wouldn't be surprising to see it nominated at The Game Awards as well this year.

        <updated>2024-10-07T14:08:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are two types of Counter-Strike 2 players. Those who have Prime, and those who don't. No, not Amazon Prime - Counter-Strike 2 Prime, an account status that comes with a bunch of benefits for players who own it.


But is CS2 Prime Status actually worth the money? Let's take a look.


What is Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status?


Image via Valve


Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status is an optional extra that you can pick up from the Steam Marketplace. While Counter-Strike 2 is usually free-to-play, there are a slew of benefits you gain from picking up Prime Status.


For a one-time purchase of $14.99, you gain access to XP, competitive skill groups, and Premier Mode. You also get a weekly in-game drop by playing matches, giving you a skin and a free CS2 case to open.


All of that is great, but those perks aren't the real selling point of Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status. You see, Prime players can only be matchmade with other Prime owners. Why is that important? Cheaters. Naturally, cheaters use free-to-play servers to avoid losing money if banned, and Prime Status circumvents this entirely.


Is Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status worth it?

In a word, yes. I'd go as far as to say Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status is essential if you want to have fun in the game at the moment.


The cheating problem in CS2 remains so, so bad, even in Premier Mode, where Prime is required. Valve continues to iterate on VAC, but until it is perfected, cheaters will continue to run rampant in Counter-Strike 2. This is amplified on non-Prime servers, where accounts don't need to pay a $14.99 entry fee to get involved. If they do get banned, they can just create another and try again!


Cheating issues aside, Prime Status pays for itself eventually, anyway. You can sell the free weekly drops you earn instead of using them. If you're someone who plays a lot of Counter-Strike 2, this will add up to the amount you paid over a long period of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now, Forza Horizon 5 has finished its transformation into the ultimate car-collecting fantasy. Sure, Hide 'n' Seek is neat and all, but unlocking and collecting awesome rides is the real meat of the game for many, and the new Back to the 90s season underlines this notion.


Playground Games isn't about to run out of seasonal content themes anytime soon, by the look of things. We've already had seasons riffing on Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and... dinosaurs, just to list a few. From October 10 until November 7, though, it's all about classic rides from the 1990s, and this means Forza Horizon 5 is getting four iconic vehicles from the given era. Is that a Mitsubishi FTO you hear roaring in the distance? Why, yes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[343 Industries is no more (sort of). Prior to the grand final of the Halo World Championship 2024 eSports tournament, the developer confirmed that it has rebranded to Halo Studios, turning a new page for the legendary franchise.


It also revealed that Halo Studios will move to Unreal Engine 5 for all future projects, of which several are in development. This marks a move away from its proprietary game engine, the Slipspace Engine, making it easier for new developers to come in and hit the ground running.

Halo is making the jump to Unreal Engine 5


Halo Studios revealed the news with an impressive UE5 video showcase titled Project Foundry, hitting all the classic Halo notes: Master Chief, Elites, Energy Swords, and even the Flood.




Nothing was officially confirmed, but given what was shown, it looked suspiciously like the Halo: Combat Evolved remaster that was rumored back in June. Are they teasing it right in front of our eyes? Only time will tell. Regardless, it looks stunning, with mind-blowing environments that look closer to Blur Studios' Halo 2: Anniversary cutscenes than any real-time gameplay seen before in the series.

As 343 Industries, the studio has developed three mainline Halo games since being founded in 2007: 4, 5: Guardians, and Infinite. Each title had positives and negatives, although it's generally agreed that the series hasn't quite reached the dizzying heights of its Bungie days. Can this rebrand and move to Unreal Engine 5 help secure a brighter future for Halo? I sure hope so.

Each weapon that can be used during Swordfighter Form is unlocked at a different point in the main story of EoW. Once unlocked, they can all be upgraded using Might Crystals at the furnace in Lueberry's house, which is especially useful as it increases the amount of damage you can do with each weapon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

This side quest, and its immediate successor, can technically be completed from the very beginning of the game, however you may have a hard time making your way to the quest location. If the quest is not completed before you begin the “Lands of the Goddesses” main quest, it will become locked until you’ve completed the “Rift on Eldin Volcano” segment of that quest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of side quests in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, 50 to be precise, and all of them are worth doing. Some of them are remarkably simple to complete, while others can be more confusing.


“What Is Snow… Really?” is a simple side quest that becomes unlocked after you’ve completed the “Still Missing” main story quest and removed the Rift that had overtaken Hyrule Castle.


How to complete What Is Snow… Really?

To begin “What Is Snow… Really?”, head to Suthorn Village and find the little boy who is standing with his Trampoline, directly west of the nearby Waypoint. Remember to learn the Trampoline Echo while you’re here if you haven’t already, and then talk to the boy. 


It turns out that Link has been telling the boy about snow, but he hasn’t ever seen any in real life, as he isn’t old enough to trek up to Hebra Mountain. In order to fulfill his request to see some snow in real life, you’ll need to summon a Snowball Echo. 


That’s all there is to this quest, and in return for showing the boy the huge ball of snow, you’ll get 8 jars of Floral Nectar to use in your Smoothie recipes.

In order to be able to complete “What Is Snow… Really?”, you’ll need to unlock the Snowball Echo, which is easier said than done. 


To unlock the Snowball Echo, you’ll need to progress the main story by heading to Hebra Mountain to complete the “Rift on Holy Mount Lanayru” portion of the “Lands of the Goddesses” main quest. 


After Conde removes grants you access to the cave behind his house, you’ll need to deal with the Stilled Hebra Mountain Cave. When you’ve cleared this small Rift, you’ll be able to climb a ladder inside the cave and find some falling Snowballs, and learn the Echo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Back in July, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Modded Hardware — an online store which, as you might expect, sells modded Switch consoles and chips — in its continued attempt to clamp down on piracy. Three months on, the alleged owner of the store, Ryan Daly, has filed his answer to the complaints where he denies any wrongdoing (thanks, TorrentFreak).
According to the complaints, Nintendo and Daly reached an agreement in March 2024 where the latter would stop selling modded consoles and MIG Switches (a card that plays pirated games on un-modded hardware). The agreement was obviously not upheld, leading Nintendo to submit a complaint to a Seattle federal court where Daly is accused of six different charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Road to the Knockouts Rush mode is now live in EA FC 25, and you can finally use your best club items.


The current mode takes the overall cap to 91, which was earlier set at 88. Moreover, there are no other restrictions, allowing you to freely pick any card you like. That said, there are always some cards at every rating which will perform better than the rest. Not only do they gel well on the meta, but the shorter format of the Rush mode allows these cards to have a competitive advantage.


Disclaimer: Heroes and Base Heroes have been excluded as it's very hard to pack them (unless you do extremely well in Champions Finals).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTTK Challenge 5 SBC is here in EA FC 25, and here's a great chance to earn one more free pack. 


The fodder challenges are perfect way to improve your squad without spending any coins. These SBCs are easy to complete, and you should have the required fodder already available in your club. Let's take a look at how to complete the last release, and what rewards you'll get after finishing the tasks.


EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 5 SBC tasks


The RTTK Challenge 5 SBC only has one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task 1 - RTTK Challenge 5 SBC



Max. 3 Players from the same League


Min. Nationalities in Squad: 5


Min. 3 Players: Gold


Min. 5 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 70


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 23



EA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 5 SBC solutions


The focus is to use cards that are already available in your club. That way, you can save your coins, and increase the valuation of your rewards. 



Mazzocchi ST 69


Desogus ST 62


Blin CM 72


White CDM 61


Whiteman CM 74


Berkoe LB 55


Ampadu CB 75


Rouault CB 75


Dixon CB 53


Koita 75


Lynch GK 64



You'll have to spend fodder worth about 3,000 coins to complete the challenge. In return, you'll earn a tradeable Prime Mixed Players Pack. The pack has 12 player items (4 Bronze, 4 Silver, 4 Gold), and six of those cards will be rare. While rewards could be better, it's never a bad thing to get a pack for practically free of cost. If you're lucky enough to pack something nice, you can also sell the card in the market to make a lot of coins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete a pretty beginner-friendly challenge in Ultimate Team. 


Shortly after his elder brother Marcus received a SBC, Khepren has received a promo card of his own. To get the item, you'll have to complete both tasks of the new SBC. Let's take a look at how you can unlock the card, and if you should invest your resources at all. 


EA FC 25 Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC tasks


Here are the requirements of the Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC, which has two tasks. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - France



Min. 1 Players from: France


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the Khepren Thuram RTTK SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - Top Form

For 50,000 coins, the 85-rated card might look slightly expensive. However, he's basically guaranteed two upgrades at least. For 50,000 coins, you're getting a 87-rated mid with a new role++ in the future. He also has some amazing playstyles like Driven Pinged Pass, Intercept, and Relentless. This SBC could become a great bargain after one month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Halloween just around the corner, it’s natural to want to get into the spooky spirit. Reading scary books is a staple of the fall season, and I’m not just talking about ghosts, ghouls and vampires.


When I think of scary books, I don’t immediately get bogged down in the supernatural, but instead I think of stories which have a possibility of coming true, however remote. The potential of people to do awful things is far scarier than ghosts in the attic, because it’s something that any of us could, if things went horribly wrong, live through. 


Of course there are some entries on this list which focus more on the stereotypical spooky factor, but you might be surprised by some of the books included.

I was expecting it to be identical to other generic romantic novels I'd read in the past, so I took my time getting through the first book.


A few days later, I'd caught up and read the first four novels before buying the fifth when it came out. I've also since read Sarah J. Maas' two other series and plan on keeping up with any new releases. Let's say I've become a fan of Maas' work over time.


Since being introduced to ACOTAR, I've been curious about how other series compare to it and what unique twists they introduce to stand out among the crowd. Let's check out some of the best books that are reminiscent — or very similar to — A Court of Thorns and Roses that you …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second season of Oshi no Ko comes to a close as the Fall 2024 anime season lineup slowly rolls in. However, the excitement that Season 2 brings isn't over just yet. After the season finale aired, the anime's official website announced the production of Oshi no Ko Season 3.


The announcement also came with a promotional video showcasing some of the second season's notable moments.




Still, there's a bit more. The anime's official X account also released an eye-catching visual to hype the upcoming season.




Furthermore, Anime News Network reports that veteran singer and voice actor Mamoru Miyano will be joining the cast as Hikaru Kamiki, while veteran voice actress Hina Kino will be voicing the enigmatic Tsukuyomi. However, Season 3's official release date is yet to be revealed.


Oshi no Ko Season 2 started airing on July 3, with the final episode airing on October 3. The season focused on the 2.5D theatrical adaptation of the famous Tokyo Blade manga. While it expounded on Aqua, Akane, and Kana's character dynamics, the latter episodes developed the narrative in terms of Aqua's search for revenge and Ruby's realization of her beloved doctor's tragic fate.


The anime is an adaptation of the popular manga series written by Aka Akasaka and illustrated by Mengo Yokoyari. It won the Anime Series of the Year at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival 2024. Both the anime's first and second seasons can be streamed on Netflix, while the manga can be read via MANGA Plus.

Season 1 often left me guessing to the point where I just couldn't flat-out anticipate what would come next. And by the time I reached its finale, I was left wondering, "What's next for our boys in the big blue?"


Season 2's first episode captures that same essence of unpredictability in an entirely unique way, blending new and familiar faces alike. You'll know exactly who the key players are by the look 'em. Just spot the ones with vibrant hair colors or an updo that would make Goku proud, and you've got your main cast. Even though the name of the game remains the same, Blue Lock Season 2 Episode 1 kicks off with a bang, leading the way for a thrilling new arc.

It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs.

Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

But all that went out of my mind the second I saw our titular hero get thrown into a cell. Come on, there's a flipping massive hole right above that bench that may as well have "Climb me!" etched into it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windblown is an action roguelite much like Dead Cells, the previous game from developer Motion Twin, but it trades sidescrolling 'vania vibes for a 3D and more colourful world, and adds co-op for up to three pals. That sounds plenty appealing, and it now has a release date: October 24th. 

Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest.

We've been playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom pretty consistently over the past week and it's safe to say we're really rather fond of it. Sure, the frame rate could be improved (not that it bothers everybody) and the lock-on can be a little fiddly, but overall it's a jolly good time and a fine return for top-down Zelda.

The performance of this 8-core Core Ultra 7 256V SoC is poor in real-world multi-threaded scenarios and the performance-per-Watt is only compelling in a subset of workloads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out 17th October on Steam, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times. We've taken to calling it "The Curse", such is its power to utterly obliterate video game development, by virtue of it being a phantom that floats into PC vents and fries motherboards. I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China.

It's sitting just behind Black Myth: Wukong at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on Banana's level, mind.

Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more Kingdom Death Monster expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.
As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

However, the blueprints for 3D-printing it are freely available on GitHub, which is enough to convince me that someone needs to develop some kind of chaotic party game that uses the Möbius strip-shaped Gboard (good spot, Tom’s Hardware) as a controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am puzzled by Ara Colon History Untold's priorities. At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism. It doesn't look like it's going for goofy, but instead opting for largely gritty and serious and almost entirely unrelated to the Yakuza games. Still, though, I do know how the show ends. It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite his cinephile tendencies, one thing you can’t accuse Kojima of is being precious about how people experience his work. Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the Tokyo Game Show? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new Death Stranding 2 scenes then. Watch them on your phone for added kino.

Bread! There is nothing so horrible, and nothing so seductive. I'd like to cut back on the stuff to minimise middle-aged corpulence, but there's a place down the road that sells this amazing, tearable sourdough, and I can't get enough of it. Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up.

The Court of Thessaloniki heard that the local man sold subscriptions to thousands of customers, generating millions of euros. After the court sent him to prison for eight years, attention now turns to a seized customer database. The authorities are said to be preparing cases against customers, some of whom have already been arrested.

Paying the academic price is funny if you say it like paying the iron price.

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

So I tried out the demo for its sequel, System Purge: Hollow Point, and can confirm that the witch still has a nice hop. I'm thankful for this, because if the witch did not have a nice hop, the game would be maddening in a bad way. Don't get me wrong, it's still maddening. Just in a good way. The hop is good.

Sometimes when I'm playing Space Marine 2's campaign, I feel like I'm trying to direct untrained child actors from the orchestra pit. No, don't look at me, Gadriel - look at the Tyranid. He can only act concussed for so long. Hit him with your chainsword now, there's a dear.

Cheaters will now be turned into frogs, provided the other players in the match vote for it. A Counter-Strike 2 modder proved the effect in a post on Xitter after the change was mentioned in some out-of-the-way patch notes by a Valve developer.

Enter Junxions, a traffic engineering game which focuses entirely on the simulation and construction of roads, railways, and pedestrian walkways, right down to the coding of the traffic lights. It's aiming for a 2025 release and you'll find its trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. 


Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

But if there's a type of game they're known for, it's engineering puzzles and factory games.

I reviewed it way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced The Midnight Walk at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase.

The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful "altered items" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These apparitions and portents, Crystal Dynamics - what game are you playing now? It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look out, it's Spiders. It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The in thing when it comes to dinosaur conversations now is this: "Yeah but did you know that they weren't all like, lizardy, but covered in feathers". You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Velmi příjemné překvapení. Dobře napsané i zahrané scény mezi lidmi, kterým poněkud nefunguje komunikace a navzájem si připadají "trochu divní". Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
