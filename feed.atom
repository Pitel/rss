Actually stay sitting down, because it's time to watch and think about the first trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, which confirms that the Elden Ring DLC expansion will focus on Miquella, a rather tragic demigod character from the main game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it's less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there's a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it's in 1.0. If you haven't yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it's very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, Aspyr and Lucasfilm Games have announced Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, a compilation of the two online multiplayer games.


The original Star Wars: Battlefront was released in 2004, followed by Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2005. Both were largely multiplayer affairs that generally followed the capture framework set by 2002’s Battlefield 1942, but with a Star Wars twist.




In 2015, EA would return to the series with the simply titled Star Wars: Battlefront in 2015 followed by Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2017. Video games, am I right? Whether or not these later games live up to the originals depends on who you ask. For those who prefer the classic PS2/Xbox/PC games, having them collected on modern platforms is a good get. They support 64 players online and include all the bonus/expansion content.


Personally, I preferred the Battlefield 1942 mod, Battlefield: Galactic Conquest. It was pretty janky, but being built on top of Battlefield 1942 makes it instantly superior. You heard me.


Still, this is pretty tempting. It’s too bad they couldn’t also fit in Free Radical’s Star Wars: Battlefront 3, which was canceled despite allegedly being mostly finished. Video games, am I right?


Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection will be available on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 14, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, we got a peek at what's to come for the hybrid console. One of the exciting announcements was that Super Monkey Ball is getting a new entry titled Banana Rumble. The game launches on June 25 this year, and pre-orders begin today, February 21. 



The latest addition to the long-running series looks like it will be choked full of content. As the trailer reveals, the platformer will feature over 200 new stages, which is more than enough Super Monkey Ball goodness for anyone. 





If you like, you can make the most of the Switch's abilities and utilize the optional motion controls. Though there'll be new challenges, you'll also have new moves to help you. This includes a new spin-dash move that allows you to overcome obstacles and create shortcuts.


Though the game can be played alone, it has placed a significant emphasis on multiplayer gaming. You'll get to enjoy a four-player local co-op mode, allowing friends and family to play together. Interested in proving yourself to the world? Then jump into the online multiplayer mode which allows up to 16 players to race their way to the finish line. 


That's not the only multiplayer mode available. There's Banana Hunt which has you collecting falling bananas, and for some PvE fun, you can try Robot Smash and try to destroy a robot with your teammates. There's even more content coming our way, but further information on that will come later. 


It looks like there'll be a lot of monkey business with Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble, but I'm ready to enjoy the chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Miquella is back. From Software and Bandai Namco just released the official gameplay trailer for the upcoming Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree and it looks exactly like I hoped it would. More epic boss battles, new weapons to find and learn, and lots of dying. You know, more Elden Ring. Shadow of the Erdtree is set to release on June 21, 2024, and is even getting its own collector's edition that looks pretty epic.




Shadow of the Erdtree


In Shadow of the Erdtree players will follow in the footsteps of Miquella, an Empyrean and brother to probably the most epic encounter in Elden Ring, Malenia. Along the way, we'll confront new bosses and acquire new weapons and armor. There's a lot to unpack from the roughly three-minute trailer, but I'll say this: a lot of the new weapons look like a lot of fun.


Shadow of the Erdtree will launch with a handful of physical and digital editions. 


Those who already have the base game can pick up just the Shadow of the ErdtreeDLC for $39.99. However, for those without a copy of Elden Ring, a new Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition includes both the base game and the new expansion.


For those wanting some extra goodies, a Premium Edition is available for both aforementioned editions that add a digital art book and digital soundtrack.

There's also a limited quantity Collector's Edition featuring a 46cm statue of "Messmer the Impaler", a 40-page physical art book, and the digital soundtrack. It also includes a voucher code for the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion on the platform of your choice.


Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree releases globally on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on June 21, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[March 8 is not far off now. But for those a little too impatient for then, a small slice of Unicorn Overlord is on the way for Switch owners today through a demo, to tide you over until then. 


Announced during today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, Vanillaware's Unicorn Overlord is getting a demo for Nintendo Switch today. Mysteriously, though Unicorn Overlord is also heading to PlayStation and Xbox Series consoles, only the Switch has been confirmed for a demo. Even outside the Direct, publisher Atlus' upload of the trailer only cites the Switch.


You can find the listing, with the demo live now, here on the eShop.




That may be bad news for any non-Switch owners looking to get tactical before March 8. Good news for the Switch folks, though: save data will convert over to the main game, so no losing any progress you make in the demo.


Don't lord it over me


It's nice, at least, to see a demo out for this, and with save data carrying over too. It feels like we've seen a lot more of these over recent years, and for big RPGs, it's an especially nice feature. A good way to dip your toe in without committing the full way.


And there looks to be quite a bit to commit to in Unicorn Overlord. The latest game from 13 Sentinels and Dragon's Crown studio Vanillaware sees the team tackling tactics, with battles reminiscent of both Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy XII's Gambit system, somehow.


It could be a big game to dig into, so having a little time to check it out now amongst a slew of other demos and games hitting the Switch is nice. If you end up digging it, the full game of Unicorn Overlord arrives on March 8, 2024 for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heads up! As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, it was announced that Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On, the previously Apple Arcade exclusive remake of the 2014 3DS title, is releasing on Nintendo Switch today.


I played the hell out of Pocket Card Jockey when it released on 3DS all those years ago. I can remember being pretty mesmerized as I trained up the best horse possible. I never did beat it, however. I remember hitting some resistance that I couldn’t overcome.


Everything else about that game is a blur to me. That’s basically it. I can remember cards, horses, and the fact that I couldn’t complete the game.


The game is like if you crossbred the Japan-only Derby Stallions series with Solitaire. You breed horses, then race them while doing card stuff to win. Really, I don’t remember what kind of card stuff, but if you watch the trailer in the Nintendo Direct, maybe you can grok it better than I can.


If my praise of the original version isn’t enough, our old pal CJ Andriesson said that Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On was “already a contender for [his] personal Game of the Year” when it released on Apple Arcade last year.


Anyway, I know what I’m doing today. Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On releases today on Switch. Now, excuse me while I keep refreshing the eShop page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, we learned Grounded is coming to Switch this April, but that's not the only Obsidian-developed title fans can expect. Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.
Pentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. 
When it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer's Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is "a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games."
Pentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox's Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future. The other two are reportedly Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush, but neither was featured on today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase.]]></summary>

Originally only on mobile and Nintendo 3DS, the remastered Monster Hunter Stories will now come to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam this summer.




In Monster Hunter Stories, players embark on a journey to the world of Monster Hunter where mighty monsters roam and people make al giving by hunting them. However, in a small village hidden deep in the land, locals form bonds with monsters instead of hunting them and become Monster Riders instead of Monster Hunters.


This upgraded and remastered version includes upgraded high definition visuals, fully voiced Japanese and English voiceovers, a new Museum Mode and all title updates that were applied to the original version that were previously only available in Japan.


Monster Hunter Stories rides onto Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam in Summer 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After confirming that some of Microsoft's console exclusives would be heading to new platforms, two of them have been confirmed for their Switch debut. Two Obsidian games, Grounded and Pentiment, are making their way to Nintendo Switch.


Announced during today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, the backyard survival game Grounded heads to Switch on April 16, 2024. That's still a couple months off, so if you want something sooner, Pentiment hits Switch tomorrow, February 22.




Switching over from Xbox


After a hectic period of rumors and speculation, Xbox confirmed last week that four of its games would be heading to new platforms. We now know for sure that Grounded and Pentiment are two of them; the other two are expected to be Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves, per The Verge.


"We see an opportunity to utilize the other platforms as a place to just drive more business value out of those games, allowing us to invest in maybe future iterations of those, sequels to those, or other games like them in our portfolio," said Xbox head Phil Spencer at the time.


Grounded is a Honey, I Shrunk the Kids-esque survival game about getting by in the backyard, staying alive against a backdrop of giant ants and such. It's an intriguing game, and I'm curious to see how it holds up on the Switch particularly.


But Pentiment? Y'all have no excuse now, if you haven't played Pentiment yet. This historical murder-mystery was one of my personal favorites of 2022, criminally overlooked in my opinion, and absolutely a must-play if you enjoy good stories, fantastic art, and the idea of a game that grapples with actual, real history.


Grounded hits Nintendo Switch on April 16, while Pentiment arrives on Switch tomorrow, February 22. We'll just have to wait to see what the last two Xbox ports are, and whether they'll also hit Switch or not.

Penny's Big Breakaway is the latest project from Evening Star, a team featuring Christian Whitehead who worked on Sonic Mania. While you might be tempted to think that the game is merely a clone of Sonic, my time with the title showed me that it has its own personality and is capable of forging a unique path for itself. 


The game follows the adventures of Penny who has a magic yo-yo that can be used to interact with different objects or even jump on when she needs to escape from the emperor's pe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Japan only.
It's the news that Mother fans have waited for for years, and as revealed in the Japanese version of today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, Mother 3 is coming to Switch. HOWEVER, the game didn't feature in the Western version of the Nintendo Direct, so it appears to be a Japan-only release right now.
The 2006 Game Boy Advance title never got released in the West, and while a brilliant fan translation exists, fans of the series and this Brownie Brown and HAL Laboratory-developed third entry have longed for an official release for years now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, the company announced that five titles from former partner Rare’s back catalog are releasing on their Nintendo Switch Online service.


The first couple are for NES: 1990’s Snake, Rattle & Roll, and 1988’s R.C. Pro-Am. For the SNES, we have 1993’s Battletoads in Battlemaniacs and 1995’s Killer Instinct. And on N64 is 1997’s Blast Corps, which requires the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack to access.




It’s no Rare Replay, but it’s… no Rare Replay.


Of the bunch, I’m excited to see Blast Corps on here. It’s a creative title that just smells like early N64. It’s all about demolishing buildings with a plethora of weird vehicles. A truck carrying nuclear devices has lost control and is very slowly moving through populated areas. The only solution, obviously, is to knock down everything in its path. And for bonus points, knock down everything that isn’t in its path, as well.


Snake, Rattle & Roll is fine. R.C. Pro-Am is a bit of an NES staple. Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is not the best nor worst game in the series. Killer Instinct is a pretty big departure from the much flashier 1994 arcade release.


Still, it’s a great bunch of games for the service. But it would have been cooler to see Rare Replay go multi-platform.


This buffet of Rare titles will hit the NSO channels today.

As announced today in Japan's Nintendo Direct Partnership Showcase, Mother 3 is now available to the online service as part of Nintendo's Gameboy Advance collection. Of course, you can always buy the RPG outside of the region. That is if you don't mind playing in Japanese and adding an additional NSO app to your Nintendo Switch.

Unfortunately, it's not the best news for those of us itching to see the classic series completely localized. Mother 3 launched almost two decades ago, back in 2006, but never saw an official translation outside of Japan. 


Those that came before, Mother and Mother 2, did, however, see international releases in one way or another. The second game, you may know as EarthBound, launched in North America in 1995, a year after its initial release in Japan. Eventually, the series debut game, just plain ole' Mother, hit the North American Wii U Virtual Console service in 2015. 




This is a lot to say, you're still out of luck, for now, if you're hoping for Mother 3 available outside of its original Japanese language script. However, you can still play EarthBound Beginnings (Mother) and EarthBound (Mother 2) via the Nintendo Switch Online service. That's not confusing at all. I'm off to kick rocks.

The Nintendo Direct featured gameplay footage of World of Goo 2. Like its predecessor, you use small goo balls to create bridges and platforms to solve puzzles, navigate the world, and reach the factory pipes endpoint. It also has new mechanics, such as goo turrets and terraforming, to make puzzle-solving more challenging. Unlike the first World of Goo, World of Goo 2 will also feature local co-op compatibility, supporting up to four players in one save. 


World of Goo 2 will be available as a console exclusive on Nintendo Switch starting May 23, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a long wait, we finally have details about Elden Ring's upcoming DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree. Publisher Bandai Namco and developer From Software released the add-on's first official trailer this morning which revealed it is launching June 21. Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.
You can check out the trailer below.


The trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella's egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear's head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.

the game's official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game. Here's the official description.
The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.
Discover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Nintendo Partner Direct today, THQ Nordic announced that 2010’s Epic Mickey is getting remade in Disney’s Epic Mickey Rebrushed.


Alongside the announcement is a trailer that shows off the upgrades. The game was original released on the Wii. To be fair, it was a pretty good looking Wii title, but the extra layer of shininess is noticeable. Starkly, the trailer opens by showing glimpses of the game’s opening (the one in the Nintendo Direct actually shows gameplay). If you’re familiar with the original, it’s very easy to see how things have improved.




Epic Mickey was reasonably well received at launch. It involves Mickey going into a dark, painted world to face off against Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character he upstaged back in the golden age of animation.


Can we workshop the title, though? No one says “Rebrushed.” It doesn’t work as a play on words.


Switch is the only platform announced for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, but it’s set to release sometime in 2024.

Grounded, a four-player survival game where players assume the roles of children shrunken down to the size of bugs, is coming to Switch this April.
Grounded originally launched on Xbox One and PC in Early Access in June 2020, where it stayed until September 2022. This is in line with Spencer's comments that the Xbox games coming to other platforms will have been exclusive on Xbox for at least a year. The other rumored Xbox titles to come to other platforms are Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush, Rare's Sea of Thieves, and another Obsidian game, Pentiment. 
Grounded arrives on Switch on April 16 with cross-platform co-op, but you can also take on the miniaturized backyard challenges solo. For more on Grounded, check out our coverage hub right here.]]></summary>

If you're unfamilair, Epic Mickey for Wii was a Wii game where a classic, mischievous Mickey finds a magic brush that lets him manipulate the world. Its legacy, however, is it marked the return of Walt Disney's original creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit's return to Disney canon.

February always delivers, doesn't it? The first Nintendo Direct of 2024 is here — and it's a Partner Showcase!
Yes, we know this isn't the Big One we were all hoping for, and yes, we know that Nintendo is forgoing the stream part and simply dropping a video on the hour, but we thought it'd still be fun to watch the video together and chat about it with you lovely people.

Slave Zero X, the pixel art action game from developer Poppy Works, has been delayed on Switch, as confirmed by publisher Ziggurat.
While no firm release date for the game has been set, Poppy Works is currently aiming to get it out on Switch around early Spring 2024. The reason for the delay is simple: Poppy Works and Ziggurat have both agreed that the game does not currently meet their expectations and are endeavouring to deliver the best experience possible for Switch owners.

He's got credits on some of the studio's best-loved games, from Baldur's Gate 2 through Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic to Dragon Age: Origins and the Mass Effect trilogy. He was BioWare's general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it's certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days. Speaking to me ahead of Nightingale's launch, Flynn talked about the difficulty of making headway as a new developer in an industry where the most successful competing live service titles have effectively become part of the landscape - indeed, a force of "gravity".

I spammed it in a panic while the randos in my voice channel fumed at the delay. Then I popped us out of the drop pods, attempted to quit the game in embarrassment, and the PC promptly crashed. Another blow for managed democracy! 


I'm hoping that the ready up problem is one of the "various UI issues [that] may appear when the game interacts with servers" which Arrowhead are addressing in a future Helldivers 2 patch. Before that, there's patch 1.000.10, which fixes PC quickplay match-making bugs, gets rid of a crash issue when displaying mission rewards, and tunes civilian extraction mission difficulty, amongst other things. It's live now, and the full changelog is below.

Ahead of the Pokémon Presents broadcast next week, The Pokémon Company has announced a brand new Mass Outbreak event for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet.
This one is a little bit different with increased spawns of Voltorb and Foongus as well as a special mystery Pokémon. It's not clear exactly what this mystery Pokémon is just yet, but it's apparently one that normally can't be caught in the Paldea region. A lot of trainers are convinced it's a Hisuian Voltorb.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FromSoftware has announced via Twitter that the expansion to Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree will be getting its first substantial trailer tomorrow. It will go live at 7am PST, 10am EST.


For those keeping up, that’s directly after the Nintendo Direct that is scheduled for 6am PST, 9am EST. Busy day.




It was about a year ago that we first heard that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was on its way. We still don’t really know much about what is going to be in it and how it will build on the 2022 megahit, but that’s what makes this announcement about an announcement so anticipated. It’s been nearly two years since the game first launched, so it’s expected to be rather extensive. We’ll have a better idea sometime tomorrow.


I never did finish Elden Ring. I guess I’ll soon know if I should hold off or if I need to pick it back up again before the expansion launches.


The trailer is set to be three minutes long, so it’s not going to be an in-depth look, but hopefully, we’ll get a good look at things.


The trailer fo Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is set to go live at 7am PST, 10am EST on February 21, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legends never die.
Last month, Riot Games announced a substantial number of layoffs within the company, and one of the casualties was the Riot Forge publishing arm. Over the last few years, Riot Forge partnered with various indie developers to produce a diverse lineup of single-player games set in the world of Runeterra, and these games all proved to be pretty good while being completely different from each other. Presumably, whatever projects it had in the works for the rest of this year have all been cancelled, making the latest release—a cozy RPG called Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story—the last hurrah of Riot Forge. Bandle Tale offers a decent, enjoyable take on a Stardew Valley-esque life sim, and though it has its issues, it feels like a good send-off for one of Riot’s most interesting initiatives.
Bandle Tale is set in the mystical realm of Bandle City, which is linked to the expansive land of Runeterra via magical portals. You play the role of a humble yordle living with their grandpa in the quiet region of Yarnville, which is mostly disconnected from other yordle settlements. Events kick off when you sneak out with your best friend to attend a party, where you inadvertently cause an enormous magical incident with a nearby portal that destroys the entire portal network and throws the entirety of Bandle City into disarray. Luckily, your character has been training for the past century in a magical form of knitting, so they set out to repair the damage done to the portal network and explore the other yordle settlements that they never got to see.

As my car fell apart around me and my health was about to hit 0%, I managed to make it to the gateway and got shunted back to the safety of the garage.


It was intense. But, I thought, that was never going to happen again. I had learned a lesson, and it was unlikely I’d experience a moment so exciting in Pacific Drive.


I was wrong.


Further along in my playthrough, I once again opened the gateway to escape and triggered the collapse of reality.

        <updated>2024-02-20T21:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.
We’ll let the trailer speak for itself.


In Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.
Since the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  
Redemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. 
Redemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we'll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've reached a point as a society where it feels like it's only a matter of time before your favorite celebrity gets added to Fortnite. When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says "Fortnite Festival," implying the crossover might be linked to the game's musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.
The funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, "what is fortnight," either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she's corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.

Amazingly, despite being such a long-running franchise, there are actually only five mainline games in the series, and twelve in total (counting mobile games and spin-offs), but Shiren has a loyal following. In the West, we were oblivious to these endless tower-climbing, dungeon-trawling adventures until 2008's punishingly difficult Wii title, Shiren the Wanderer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft and Netflix have announced that Rainbow Six SMOL, the spin-off of the venerable Tom Clancy sub-series, is now available on Android and iOS.


Rainbow Six SMOL takes the once realism-focused tactical FPS series and shrinks it down to cartoon-ish proportions. You command a squad of counterterrorists as they march around procedurally generated stages, blasting everything in sight. The press release suggests that you can take a sneak approach, but there are a lot of explosions in the trailer that suggest that’s unlikely.




I used to love Rainbow Six back in its pre-Ubisoft days. Even following Red Storm’s acquisition, I frequently returned to it straight up through its bastardization in the Rainbow Six Vegas games. I fell off that after Ubisoft did what Ubisoft does and sucked a lot of the color out of the games, which is weird to say about tactical shooters.


Rainbow Six SMOL, however, actually looks like it could be fun. The trailer shows off a good flow of action and demonstrates some of its features, like a fog of war that obscures everything your characters can’t see at the moment. It still looks like a far cry from its tactical roots, but it doesn’t look like it completely excludes its DNA. I think it’s a bit troubling to depict something like counterterrorism with such cartoonish glee. That's some dystopian territory we walked into, but that’s video games for you.


Seriously, though, I’m typically allergic to mobile games, but this looks like something I want to try. The press release says that it’s available exclusively to Netflix members, so it might be worth a shot. Assuming I don’t just forget about it moments after posting this article, which is always a risk.


Rainbow Six SMOL is available now for Android and iOS exclusively for Netflix members.

And for another early look, IGN released a short teaser, which confirms a trailer drop tomorrow, February 21.




According to the trailer via IGN for their Fan Fest, the full trailer is expected to launch on February 21, 2024. As we can see, it's colorful, vibrant, and hectic as hell. So far, that seems on par with the looter shooter's style. The trailer description gives a bit of context for the madness, as we follow Lilith and her ragtag crew as they rescue Atlas' daughter on Pandora.

"Two of my worst launches," McMillen claims, explaining that "both launches went wrong because we locked a release date too early then crunched too hard to hit it." This will not be the case with Mewgenics, he says, as he feels the game is near and dear to him, and wants it to release in as good and polished of a state as possible. Further, even though McMillen says the game is now "roughly 11 months away from being content complete," this does not mean it's bound to release in just over a yea…]]></summary>

Titanic: A Space Between falls more in the strange category, though it manages to capture my attention thanks to its gorgeous visuals, compelling tale, and a runtime that is just long enough to leave you wanting more.


The Titanic ship and its terrible fate have always been a magnet for macabre myths and mysteries, and Globiss Interactive's game plays on this concept while grappling with the morality of turning a real deadly disaster into a thing of amusement. The terror and tragedy are all present, and it's up to you to decide whether you want to engage with it or get sucked into a sightseeing adventure instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Abstraction Games aims to resurrect Gigantic, the 5v5 MOBA-hero-shooter hybrid that went offline in 2018 – only a year after its full release. I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.

Notably, Game Informer's original Gigantic review wasn't as positive as I personally felt about the game. Did you play the original version? If so, what was your opinion? Do you think Gearbox can successfully find an audience this time around?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco's epic RPG Tales of Arise is now available on Xbox Game Pass. It will be joined this month by the adorable Bluey: The Videogame, Indivisible, and Space Engineers among other titles, according to Xbox Wire.


Tales of Arise can now be played by Game Pass subscribers on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC. It also works on the cloud through the Xbox app on your phone. It's a well-regarded JRPG marked as a return to form for the long-running Tales of series. It's also on PlayStation Plus through the Extra and Premium Game Catalog options this month, too.


In our review, Eric Van Allen wrote: "Whether this is the big Tales breakthrough or not is a matter that history will decide. This is a Tales game that hits the right spots for me, puts a lot of love into its cast and its action, and somehow manages to strike a balance between the old and the new. It’s not without a few shortcomings, but it’s also got a lot of improvements that at least shore those up a bit."

If you're not a big JRPG fan, you're in luck because there are many February and March Xbox Game Pass titles to look forward to. They include Return to Grace, Bluey: The Videogame on February 22, Maneater (which is returning on February 27), Madden NFL 24 for cloud services on February 27, underrated RPG Indivisible on February 28, and Space Engineers on February 29.


The Doom-like FPS game Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun also demolishes its way to Xbox Game Pass on March 5. Another huge game Diablo IV slithers its way to Xbox Game Pass on March 28. If you get fed up with Tales of Arise on Xbox Game Pass, you can always get into Blizzard's action RPG madness.

The post Tales of Arise hits Xbox Game Pass today, as more games head to Pass in February appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few years, the Call of Duty franchise has seen plenty of peaks and valleys when it comes to cheating. It's a bad time for everyone, and that's why Activision developed Ricochet Anti-Cheat, which was supposed to be the answer to the CoD community's problems. 


After years of holding off on using an anti-cheat to create their own, Ricochet has been better, but not great. Now, cheating seems to be on the uptick again across Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer and Warzone.


New Call of Duty cheats are getting out of hand


Cheating in Call of Duty is bad right now. Especially if you're a highly-ranked player, it feels like the killjoys are in nearly every multiplayer or Warzone match. And it isn't just aim botters and wallhackers anymore, either. Cheaters have created new and outrageo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're in a bit of a live-action video game adaptation golden age right now. Not every project is a hit, but there have been enough success stories that learning about a new film or TV show in the works doesn't instantly fill fans with dread. The latest example of that growing trend is the live-action Borderlands movie, which we just got our first official looks at, thanks to People.
This image shows the main line-up of the movie. Going clockwise, starting from the top left, Ariana Greenblatt is Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu is Krieg, Jamie Lee Curtis is Tannis, Jack Black is the voice of Claptrap, Kevin Hart is Roland, and Cate Blanchett takes the lead role as Lilith. You can see a head-on image of her character below.
This film has been in the works for a while now, but outside of these images, there's not much new information. If you haven't seen it yet (or just need a refresher, since it's been over two years), here's the official synopsis from a 2021 press release:
IGN also shared the movie's first official poster.
Here's the exclusive new poster for the @BorderlandsFilm!

They tend to either feel underwhelming or, worse, to actually do a competent job that ends up replacing the beautiful memories we had of the original. I didn't have either problem with the new Tomb Raider Remastered. 


Originally, I thought that was just because the game gave me the chance to pick between a respectfully improved version of the old, and a beautiful new vision for the classic, but there was more to it than just that. Now I have the full picture.


It turns out that the remaster had long-time fan Xproger at the helm, the person responsible for OpenLara, a multiplatform open-source engine of the OG games. Instead of sending this Xproger a cease-and-desist letter, Saber—the owner of Aspyr, the company behind the remaster—decided t…]]></summary>

Xenonauts 2 released via Steam Early Access in July 2023, almost a full decade after its predecessor first came out, and it's been trucking along ever since. Its latest update, Milestone 3 (version 3.0.8) is substantial indeed, introducing an all-new Cruiser UFO encounter, Fusion-tier weapons for the invaders and Xenonaut forces, and a variety of other bits and bobs, such as the upgraded ARES combat drone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tinybuild has announced Road Redemption developer Redemption Road Games’ Kingmakers, which takes medieval battle simulation and perverts it with modern firepower. I can dig it.


The trailer’s pretty awesome, misdirecting with some shots of gameplay that could be torn out of any number of medieval RTS. Then, it cuts to someone driving a pickup truck through the battle, and it gets weirder from there.




You play as someone from the future who gets sent back in time to intervene in a war. You’re trying to prevent the apocalypse and simultaneously confuse archeologists by leaving bullet casings on battlefields. But beyond just enjoying a vast technological advantage, you also get to lead your troops, popping out of third-person combat to an overhead RTS viewpoint. You also plop down buildings, but judging by the guys running around during this sequence in the trailer, it looks more like Command & Conquer basebuilding than metagame citybuilding.


Blasting knights with modern firepower isn’t really anything new, but somehow, it isn’t very pervasive (yet). It’s an appealing concept. It was always very satisfying in the Civilization series to have a vast technological superiority and roll tanks over their archers.


Kingmakers also features co-op for anyone who has friends. It can be played with four people, each commanding their own army. I have to wonder what a co-op campaign would look like for the game.


For that matter, I’m curious about the single-player campaign. The trailer shows the player jumping back and forth between the medieval setting and the future. The footage focuses more on the core gameplay without really revealing what will tie it together. However, I really enjoyed Road Redemption and appreciate the developer's approach, so I’m totally on board.


Kingmakers is planned to launch into Steam Early Access sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale releases into Steam early access today. Our pre-launch impressions? Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We're also pretty keen as a team on the game's Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. 


Speaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion's CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is "cautious" about committing to a full-blown roadmap.

The Pokémon Company has announced that the annual showcase for the franchise will return next week on February 27. As for what to expect, no details were shared but if it's like previous Pokémon Day celebration showcases, it could be an exciting day for trainers. 
This news was revealed today on the official Pokémon X (formerly Twitter) account with a quick video showing a 3D Pikachu rushing onto the screen to pose in front of the Pokémon Presents logo while a retro rendition of a classic song plays. Now, instincts might tell you to read into this model and song but experience learned from previous announcements says it's not a tease – The Pokémon Company always does this kind of stuff and there's almost no…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every year, there are a couple of game soundtracks I become properly obsessed with. In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  
Composed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.

Fitting for a game that our Rogue Trader review called "engrossing, obscure and absolutely exhausting". It adds loads of new voiced lines, fixes everything from wonky abilities to broken quests, reworks balance, improves performance, and so much more. Enough is changed that developers Owlcat are giving everyone in your party a free respec to adjust to what the game has become.

Out today for PC at 12pm UTC, 1pm GMT, 7am ET and 4am PT, the 1.07 patch adds Full Synchronization Challenge, a permadeath mode (originally teased last year) that not only permakills you when you're slain by enemies, but also deletes your save file when you commit crimes such as slaughtering civilians, or going outside of "authorised map locations".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo will air a Partner Showcase of its Direct videos this week on Wednesday, February 21. Unlike a traditional Direct, Partner Showcases are presentations that highlight upcoming third-party games for Switch.
The Direct will air at 6 a.m. Pacific/9 a.m. Eastern on YouTube and will run for 25 minutes. Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”
Ignoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:
Inkulinati
Unicorn Overlord
Gylt
Highwater
South Park: Snow Day!
Open Roads
Botany Manor
Tales of Kenzera: Zau
SaGa Emerald Beyond
Braid: Anniversary Collection
Numerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.
Or we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. 
Of course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out. What do you hope to see in the Partner Direct? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warframe is making the jump to mobile devices, namely iOS, tomorrow, February 20. Now, fans of the popular sci-fi action MMO can continue playing anywhere.
The iOS version features 10 years' worth of content and supports cross-play and cross-progression, meaning players can bring their characters anywhere they go. Additionally, players who log in between February 20 and 27 receive a free day 1 award, including 3 Day Affinity Booster and Bombyx Syandana. Warframe is compatible with iPhones and iPads with the A12 bionic chip or later (12th generation iPhones/8th generation iPads and up). 


An Android version is also planned, but its release is currently unknown. You can, however, pre-register for that version on Warframe’s website. 
Will you be playing Warframe on iOS? Let us know in the comments! Be sure also to check out developer Digital Extreme’s upcoming fantasy game, Soulframe.]]></summary>

Nearly 10 years on from 2015's Helldivers, Helldivers 2 carefully adapts the simple yet exciting formula of bug-blasting with buddies for a modern audience. Arrowhead Game Studios has swapped the top-down perspective for third-person while maintaining the frenetic, ballistic loop of crash-landing on hostile planets, completing difficult missions, and extracting against all odds.
In a galaxy torn apart by war, you and your friends are Helldivers, the brainwashed protectors of Super Earth, invigorated by humorous trite …]]></summary>

The question was posed to Cameron Monaghan, known for his roles on Gotham and Shameless as well as his starring role as Cal Kestis in the Star Wars Jedi series. For Monaghan, it's not a question of whether he's willing to reprise his role as the character, but a question of the circumstances in which that character would appear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it's cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro's whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you're dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you've won a run of Balatro.
The boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand's chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I've yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it's been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn't simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It's about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn't just encouraged in Balatro. It's damn near mandatory, and it's all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.

Stormgate creator Frost Giant—a studio created by former StarCraft 2 devs—is following up on its recent…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is turning out to be an absolute laugh riot of a co-op shooter; it may even have the potential to rival Deep Rock Galactic on good vibes and teammate deaths as accidental comedy masterstrokes. Even ongoing server connectivity issues haven’t done much to spoil the sense of fun, which incidentally, can also be shared on the Steam Deck.
Indeed, following a quick Proton update on Valve’s part, its previously SteamOS-incompatible anti-cheat will no longer put the kibosh on you dropping into Helldivers 2 via your Deck. I’ve been testing on both an original 512GB model and the newer Steam Deck OLED, and as long as you don’t mind dropping the quality settings, it can usually run tidily above 30fps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern art puzzler Please, Touch The Artwork was a bit of a surprise hit when it came out in 2022. It not only poked fun at the reverential distance enforced on us by stuffy old art galleries, but it also invited us to recreate abstract modern masterworks by clicking, tracing and generally getting up close and personal with them with our big, colourful in-game fingers. Now, solo developer Thomas Waterzooi is back with Please, Touch The Artwork 2, which takes us on a slightly different journey through the art world as a hidden object point and click game. It's out today, is completely free, and was made to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the death of the Belgian expressionist and surrealist painter James Ensor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MojeFedora.cz informuje, že ovladač Nvidia už není v GNOME Software. Před 7 lety se zjednodušil způsob, jak nainstalovat proprietární ovladače Nvidia do Fedory. Pokud jste po instalaci souhlasili s repozitáři třetích stran, přidal se speciální repozitář z RPMFusion, který balíčky s ovladačem obsahoval. Zároveň byla přidána integrace s GNOME Software, takže stačilo dát hledat v katalogu softwaru "nvidia" a ovladač šlo nainstalovat několika kliknutími.

Nyní se od tohoto řešení ustoupilo. Ovladač v RPMFusion totiž není podepsaný klíčem Fedory a tudíž nefunguje se SecureBootem, který má dnes zapnutý většina počítačů. Zmizela pouze integrace s GNOME Software, kde už nyní ovladač nenajdete. Repozitář s ovladačem je stále k dispozici a lze ho doinstalovat přes DNF. Uživatelů, kteří ovladač už nainstalovaný mají, by se to nemělo nijak dotknout. Momentálně se hledá nové řešení, které by bylo jednoduché a zároveň fungovalo se SecureBootem.]]></summary>

A mod for Matthew Perry career high and/or nuclear apocalypse RPG sidequest Fallout: New Vegas, which was thought lost since some time around 2016, has been found by chance on someone's hard drive. The content of this mod, you ask? It adds a companion who looks like redoubtable nu-metal pioneer Fred Durst. I was trying to come up with a pun to do with "nookie" or that modders will "keep rollin'", but I respect you too much for that (also it's Monday and I'm very tired - give me something to break, am I right?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the things I like bestest about Inflexion's alt-Victorian fantasy survival game Nightingale is its Realm cards mechanic, whereby you generate and modify worlds by playing Major and Minor cards. Major cards are used at portals to conjure up a particular biome or world type and set the difficulty, including an approximate choice of resident NPC factions, local fauna and resources. Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings. You can lower the gravity for optimal umbrella gliding conditions, alter the weather or summon a Blood Moon (sorry, Zelda) that reduces your max health.

But despite looking like an SNES classic and playing like a mix between Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Bandle Tale unfortunately ties itself in knots with overly grindy crafting that had me rubbing my temples in an effort not to combust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skull and Bones is finally out today. Let's play the opening hour and see if it is worth wait. Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it. Our full review isn't ready quite yet, but you can  read Matt Miller's positive early impressions so far by heading here. You can also check out an hour of gameplay below.

Insider Gaming reports that its sources have disclosed that Respawn is developing a first-person title in which players assume the mantle of a Mandalorian. For clarification, players do not play as the Mandalorian, as in Din Djarin from the hit Disney Plus series, but rather as a different bounty hunter. The game is reportedly set during the height of the Galactic Empire and will see players capturing or killing bounty targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an outgrowth of the naval combat experiences in the Assassin's Creed series, I've been curious about Skull and Bones since its announcement as a standalone title in 2017. Since then, the game has seen numerous delays and fundamental reworks on the development side. Our cover story on the game captured one moment in the evolving project’s life in the summer of 2022, and it has continued to change in the months that followed. In recent weeks, some sentiments on the internet and in gaming communities have concluded that, by this point, the game that is releasing must be a mess.
I’m happy to report that’s not the case; Skull and Bones is a lot of fun.
Review access only opened up a few days ago, and the game on offer is exceptionally dense and large, so we’re still working on pulling togeth…]]></summary>

If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It's what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. 
It is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it's a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I've been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I've got cooking, and I've been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.
This might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because it’s somehow my job to worry about the technical fidelity of electronic toys, I’ve been eyeing the long-overdue arrival of Skull and Bones with some nervousness. After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.
But nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.
While Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.

Ahead of the game's launch, developer Matt Dabrowski has started releasing a series of dev diary videos detailing his design process and how it's all coming together. The latest is about how he creates the game's proc-gen open worlds and biomes, and it's a fascinating watch if you've ever wondered how its particular blend of randomised chaos works behind the scenes.

The non-peer-reviewed research confirms previously published findings that were limited to the UK. The effects on unblocked pirate sites are mixed, however, and whether the increased interest in legal content lasts over longer periods has yet to be researched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important "updates on the Xbox business." You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.
According to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.
Spencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.
Bond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.


The podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/15/ea-sports-college-football-25-arrives-this-summer-full-reveal-in-may"/>
        <updated>2024-02-15T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.
The video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. 


EA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. 
With Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). 
We don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new trailer for Princess Peach: Showtime shows off some more outfits and abilities the Mushroom Kingdom’s pink monarch has up her royal sleeve. 
Princess Peach: Showtime pits Peach against the villainous Sour Bunch, who crashes a performance at the Sparkle Theater. Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. 
The video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.


Princess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's happening! Why I played Skull & Bones back when it wasn't even a live service game. But now it is, and it's out this weekend. We talk a bit about how long it has been coming out, why it's been in development this long, and why they didn't just release the sucker the two or three previous times they got close to doing so. Honestly, I hope it does okay. We also talk about the games we've been playing this week, and Nate challenges us with a game of Palworld Pal: real or fake? PLUS the giant game dildo and our recommendations this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I respect a game with wild ambition. Declaring your game "the spiritual successor to Freelancer" is bold and ambitious, considering how the spaceship sim is still so beloved after 20 years that our readers voted it your 16th favourite space game of all time. This ambition is wild when the tiny development team is led by someone best known for replacing Skyrim's dragons with Thomas The Tank Engine. So while I'm not much of a spaceship sort, I had to check out the demo for Underspace, which aims to combine Freelancer shoot-o-trading space action with a dash of Lovecraftian horror.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tracking technology isn't perfect. Actually, that's an understatement. Tracking technology has many pitfalls, including how Google Maps can be accidentally used to track people, and the fact that if you systematically turn off cookies, your internet browsing experience becomes increasingly bizarre. I am offered adverts for afro hair care products and huge bags of puppy kibble, because the algorithms no longer have any idea who I am or how many small dogs I have. And yet.
Surely this technology has reached the point where, if I open a game for the first time in several weeks, it should be able to tell I haven't played for a long time, and ask if I would like a small refresher of the controls.

Taking a leaf from the book of feared intergalactic corsair Samus Aran, the prologue starts you off at the height of your bucanneering powers, with a mighty gold-and-scarlet galleon at your disposal that is shortly blown to bits by the English Navy.

You will be shocked and aroused to learn that I preface with all this just so I can make an exception of Islands Of The Caliph. Does this mean she's becoming more open minded, or just that she's found a way to gripe and complain even within a recommendation? Who can say, readers.
What I can say is that I don't merely hate it less than its genremates. I think it's a bloody great little RPG, full of charm and detail that never drags it down.

Running into this hapless buffoon is always a delight in Cobalt Core, as he's one of the few special characters who doesn't instantly attack you on sight. Rather, the task here is always to try and save him from his own idiocy - namely, his malfunctioning ship that keeps firing his missiles right back toward him. He's an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you.

But here we are, with the survival game exceeding 19 million players and Pocketpair probably wondering how they managed such a feat. With its success has come the inevitable slew of impatient people saying the game's dead because it's not received updates fast enough, or folks saying it's lost a hefty percentage of its player base, and others saying its viewership numbers over on streaming services have plummeted. Palworld's community manager Bucky has gently reminded folks that not only is this discourse "lazy", but to play other games instead.

Amid the talk of revenues, profits and losses, we learn that Embracer have laid off 8% of their global workforce since announcing their restructuring program in June 2023. According to the report, Embracer's total headcount has fallen from 16,243 in the period October-December 2022 to 15,218 in the period October-December 2023. The number of Embracer studio game projects in development, meanwhile, has fallen from 224 to 179.

Do not, for the love of all that's ancient and holy, play this game with its newly-added modern control scheme. The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara's OG adventures from the late 90s, and I'm not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara's.

Helldivers 2 will "never" get a PvP mode, according to Arrowhead's CEO Johan Pilestedt. The reason? They want to avoid encouraging any toxic behaviour in the new shooter's multiplayer community.
Given that Helldivers 2 is a game with mandatory friendly fire in which you can kill team-mates by respawning right on top of them, I fear the Good Ship Camaraderie may already have sailed, but I'm very early on in my Helldiver career, and I'm... intrigued by how Arrowhead's efforts at community curation sit alongside/within the game's premise of playing a dirty space fascist locked in an endless xenophobic crusade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is my current go-to high-end gaming CPU recommendation, on account of its brilliant top-tier performance at a mid-tier price. The CPU normally costs around £375, but today it's down to £350 at Amazon UK. This isn't the cheapest we've ever seen this model, but it's the best price recorded in 2024 so far and a solid £25 below the going rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4070 Super is a rather good deal, offering a significant boost in gaming performance over the earlier RTX 4070 - in fact, it's closer to the 4070 Ti than the vanilla 4070. That makes it a great choice for gaming up to 4K, while costing just a bit over the £500 mark - £539 to be accurate after a £50 discount that puts it below the UK RRP of £579. 
That price is for a relatively modest Zotac Twin Edge model which fits easily even into small form factor PC, but thanks to the efficiency of the Ada Lovelace architecture the card should still run quite cool and quiet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fantastic Four finally arrive in the Marvel Cinematic Universe next year, and Marvel Studios has officially revealed who will don the team’s iconic blue suits.
The Fantastic Four was first announced in 2019 and is scheduled to premiere next year as the second film in Phase Six of the MCU. In a sweet Valentine's Day message, Marvel announced the following actors will portray Marvel’s First Family: 
Happy Valentine’s Day from Marvel’s First Family! Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn are The Fantastic Four.

Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic - Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian)
Sue Storm/Invisible Woman - Vanessa Kirby (Napoleon, The Crown) 
Johnny Storm/Human Torch - Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things, Overlord)
Ben Grimm/The Thing - Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear, The Punisher)
Pedro Pascal has been on a roll lately, starring as Joel in HBO's The Last of Us, portraying the titular Mandalorian in The Mandalorian, and starring in films such as The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and the upcoming Gladiator 2. Vanessa Kirby made her name portraying Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, most recently played Joséphine in Ridley Scott's historical epic Napoleon, and has appeared in the recent Mission: Impossible films as Alanna. Stranger Things season 4 fans know Joesph Quinn best as the season's breakout character, Eddie Munson. Ebon Moss-Bachrach has recently been known as Richard "Richie" Jerimovich in the FX series The Bear and as Arvel Skeen in the Star Wars series Andor. 
WandaVision director Matt Shakman will direct The Fantastic Four, though its story details remain scarce. The Fantastic Four is scheduled to hit theaters on July 25, 2025.]]></summary>

The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, a visual novel Tarot-themed card game from perennial (perhaps perineal, in this case) favourites Deconstructeam, was praised by Edwin in his review, and I was going to use the same strapline for this news post had he not got there first. Because now, in time for the season of romance, they've teamed up with sex toy purveyors Uberrime to create a frankly prohibitively massive dildo as an official tie-in for the game, which can be won in a free competition by three lucky people living in either the UK, EU, US or Canada (as in, they each win their own dildo; they don't have to time share).
I mean I say "prohibitively", but I don't know your life.

The strikers are calling it a "badly balanced rewards system". Cheeky devils!
The news comes care of a post from Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, who have evidently been doing their homework on videogame humour. That research has paid off, for here I am writing about the strikes, though I think I probably would have written about them anyway.

In Helldivers 2 it isn't actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.
But comedy isn't just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.

Ys X: Nordics was first released in Japan last September and will come stateside this fall. It will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a JRPG that is ticking off many of the action RPG tropes. It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.
In practice, though, you sort of can't be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I'm not selling it as such, but it's actually charming.

A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game's classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo's 2024.
In the game's opening, Donkey Kong raids a toy factory where they make Mini Marios, the hottest new product on the market. To get them back, Mario must chase him down through eight worlds…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[February's Steam Next Fest demo bonanza officially concluded on Monday, and Valve have now revealed the 50 most played games you all tucked into across the week-long event. Ordered by the number of unique players that spent time with them during Next Fest proper (meaning all those early demo plays from earlier in the month haven't been counted), the most popular game of the lot was one that was only formally announced right at the end of January. So congratulations Dungeonborne - your blend of PvPvE dungeon crawling and fantasy skelly monsters clearly struck a chord with this year's Next Festers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a delicious piece of mad science: what if you spliced the ale-sodden DNA of Deep Rock Galactic’s dwarven miners with tissue samples from a Vampire Survivors-like autoshooter?
It shouldn’t work, surely. It would be easy to look at this spin-off and question why it takes the co-op out of one of the best co-op games on PC, or to shovel it aside as a cynical attempt at latching onto the popularity of autoshooters/Survivors-likes/bullet heavens (delete as preferred). But you’d be a smooth-handed leaf lover, my friend, as not only does DRG’s mix of horde shooting and rock smashing translate remarkably well to the format, even this early access version is heaps of subterranean fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now you'll probably have read quite a bit about our preview adventures in Inflexion Games' upcoming fantasy survival adventure Nightingale - including our slightly raucous attempts to interview CEO Aaryn Flynn while instant KO-ing tree monsters and abusing our supplies of ice bullets. But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.
With so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.

Over the past week the devs have deployed server hotfixes and matchmaking tweaks, although one server and rewards patch had to be rolled back to fix "significant" performance issues. Still, they're doing their utmost as the game becomes PlayStation's biggest PC release to date. And the latest patch brings with it a slew of crash fixes, reductions to disconnects, further tweaks to matchmaking, and preps things for future server improvements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the event that I walk in front of a particle accelerator, get converted into digital data and am promptly isekai-ed into a gameworld, I hope that gameworld is the opening port town from the original Grandia, released on PS1 way back in 1997 (and ported to PC in 2019). There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen. 


Oh sorry, I rhetorically lost myself for a minute there! I'm supposed to be telling you about Terra Memoria, a new RPG featuring time travel, magic crystals and animal wizards. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Universe Online developer Dimensional Ink Games and its publisher Daybreak Game Company have been hit with layoffs. 
According to Kotaku, Dimensional Ink lost an unknown number of senior staff, with Game Developer reporting reductions in the art, community, and narrative departments. The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. 
This is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. 
Among others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 is a third-person co-op shooter that's centred as much around action as it is comedy. Gigantic insects and red-eyed robots threaten the sanctity of Super Earth and, frankly, this isn't on. As a Helldiver, you must team up with your compatriots and pulverise these menaces for freedom (a shoulder-mounted laser cannon) and democracy (an aerial bombardment). Seriousness is reserved for the act of extermination, which adds tactility to the familiar motions of a shooter, making for horde management that promotes efficiency and frequent lapses of judgement in equal measure. Helldivers 2 is a slapstick masterpiece.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there. You see a chair in a game. It prompts you to sit. Curious, you oblige. 
Your digital butt meets the seat, and…nothing. You just sit and stare for a few seconds before rising and continuing your adventure. More often than not, sitting does not result in a cutscene, reward, character dialogue, or, in some cases, even a good view of your surroundings. You just sit. 
You could be slaying a mighty dragon.
You could be rescuing your captive friends.
You could be discovering the true meaning behind your existence and your place in the cosmos.
But instead, you sit. 
With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, amid rumors about Xbox exclusives coming to other platforms, Phil Spencer announced an event that would detail the future of Xbox. While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the "where" and "when": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern

February 12, 2024
The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.
The other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.

In a response that spoke of the need for “autonomous initiatives” inspired by "ethics and self-regulation," the head of telecoms regulator AGCOM disagreed.

And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every RPG faithful has that formative experience that turned them into a lifelong fan. But what if you could experience it again for the first time? Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance. However, when tho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helskate is a rogue game where you are trying to escape Hell on a skateboard. The game is heavily inspired by the Tony Hawk series, which makes sense as its game director, Steve Swink, worked on Tony Hawk's Underground. Join me and Game Informer's resident Tony Hawk expert, Blake Hester, as we play a bit of the game, discuss its Tony Hawk overlap, and what sets it apart.
Helskate is entering early access on February 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Cells was developed and released by Motion Twin in 2018, and in an atypical move in the world of game development, members of that team branched off to form Evil Empire, which in turn supported Dead Cells with new content for many years. Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, "The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

General fixes and features
Below is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug 
reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by reporting a bug. You can also vote for an existing issue to indicate that it also affects

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 has had a rough road following the early success of the first game. That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic the Hedgehog Movie spinoff series, Knuckles, is premiering April 26, and ahead of its streaming debut, Paramount has released a trailer. The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
