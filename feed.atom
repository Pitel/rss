        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.
That Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.
Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jonathan Joestar introduces you to many of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure characters, from Robert E.O. Speedwagon to William Zeppeli. You'll have to conquer a few quests with them, involving some classic object-finding tasks. We're here to help you through the main quest line by showing you how to find Speedwagon's hat in World of Stands.


World of Stands Speedwagon's Hat location


Once you complete enough of the main quests in London, you'll meet Robert E.O. Speedwagon during the Time for Me to Fly mission. He'll enlist you on the quest to find his hat, which will be on top of one of the London buildings. First, look for the Gold Medal Beans structure in front of Joestar Estate.

Go toward the side of the building and climb up the ladder to reach the rooftop. There will be a few Speedwagon thugs here, but you can avoid them to focus on the mission.

Turn left and cross the wooden board to reach the next rooftop. Here, you'll find the elusive Speedwagon's hat for the World of Stands quest. Return to Robert, who should be underneath the same building where you found the hat. As a token of his gratitude, he'll reward you with 200 gold and 270 XP.

With the successful retrieval of Speedwagon's hat, you'll unlock the character's next quest, Can't Fight This Feeling. This mission is a crucial part of the main quest line, and by defeating three Speedwagon gang members, you'll earn more gold and XP. They'll be lingering around London, including near the hat location, so they shouldn't be too challenging to find. Utilize your Stand companion for quick takedowns, progressing you further in World of Stands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite its status as a spin-off, Mario Party has become a well-established franchise of its own over the course of many years. Since 1998, the series has delighted and, often, enraged many fans. Super Mario Party Jamboree is next in line, bringing new ways to play and yell.


To be fair, most of the venting is due to the series of party games being surprisingly competitive, despite its delightfully spirited aesthetic. I've often joked that if you're looking to ruin friendships, few things work better than discussing religion, politics, or playing Mario Party. The games are a lot of fun for large gatherings, featuring exciting minigames to compete in as one of many dozens of Mario characters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like last few games, NBA 2K25 has an established list of contact dunk requirements that you'll have to stick with before you can slam on top of your opponent.


Contact dunk requirements are important for most, and especially if you're running a MyCareer build focused on the C/PF positions. To unlock the best animations for your specific build, you'll need to meet the requirements. Let's take a look at how the requirements look this year for all available builds. 


Like in NBA 2K24, contact dunks can be split into four categories, and we will take a look at all their requirements. 


NBA 2K25 Two Foot Moving contact dunk requirements


Almost identical settings as last year, the emphasis on vertical has been slightly lowered. 


Type
Requirements




Elite
Driving Dunk 96+, Vertical 82+


Pro
Driving Dunk 87+, Vertical 75+


Small
Driving Dunk 86+, Vertical 75+, Height under 6'5






NBA 2K25 One Foot Moving contact dunk


Type
Requirements




Elite
Driving Dunk 99+, Vertical 80+


Pro
Driving Dunk 89+, Vertical 78+


Small
Driving Dunk 93+, Vertical 80+, Height under 6'5






NBA 2K25 Standing contact dunk


This particular type is unavailable for small builds due to the height requirements. 


Type
Requirements




Elite Standing Bigs
Standing Dunk 90+, Vertical 70+, Height at least 6'10


Pro Standing Bigs
Standing Dunk 80+, Vertical 60+, Height at least 6'10






NBA 2K25 Alley-Oops contact dunk


The Alley-Oops contact dunk has the largest available options. 


Type
Requirements




Elite
Driving Dunk 92+, Vertical 80+


Pro
Driving Dunk 84+, Vertical 70+


Big
Standing Dunk 85+, Driving Dunk 70+, Vertical 60+, Height at least 6'10


Small
Driving Dunk 86+, Vertical 85+, Height under 6'5






Once you've met these requirements with your MyPlayer build, you can create the dunks using Dunk Style Creator. Once done, you can then assign the package from the Animations screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official ratings reveal for EA FC 25 has begun, and EA Sports has revealed the top 25 names in women's football.


After giving a massive push last year, women's football will continue to be a growing force across all game modes. This year, Barcelona's Aitana Bonmati has risen to the top of the rating chain with an overall rating of 91. She's followed closely by other big stars plying their trades across European football. Without further ado, let's take a look at who has made it to the list of the top 25.


Top 25 women's footballers in EA FC 25


Here's the complete list of all the names of those who have made it to the top 25.



Aitana Bonmati CM 91


Alexia Putellas CM 90


Caroline Graham Hansen RW 90


Sam Kerr ST 90


Sophia Smith ST 89


Ada Hegerberg ST 89


Mapi Leon 89


Marie Antoinette Katoto ST 88


Debinha CAM 88


Kadidiatou Diani RW 88


Patri Guijarro CDM 88


Beth Mead RW 88


Wendie Renard CB 88


Guro Reiten LM 88


Irene Paredes CB 88


Christine Endler GK 88


Alexandra Popp ST 87


Sakina Karchaoui LB 87


Mallory Swanson LM 87


Rose Lavelle 87


Ewa Pajor ST 87


Lauren Hemp LW 86


Khadija Shaw ST 86


Fridolina Rolfo LB 86


Selma Bacha LB 86





The top-25 list includes some fan favorites. Aitana is followed closely by WSL star Sam Kerr and her own Barcelona clubmates Alexia Putellas and Caroline Graham Hansen. All three have an overall rating of 90. Barcelona could be the best club in women's football, as they have more stars on this list.


The top league in French football also has its fair share of representatives, led by Hegerberg and Renard. The duo of Karchaoui and Bacha will be a favorite of those who swear by the meta. In comparison, the WSL has taken a few hits, but Reiten and Mead could be wonderful cards to use in Ultimate Team.


We will review all the cards in detail once EA FC 25 goes live on early access on September 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been 25 long years since the release of the Dreamcast (in North America), Sega’s short-lived but beloved little console. That’s about the time that society began to slide downhill. To celebrate this (the console, not the slide), Limited Run Games has some great swag to take you back to the before times.


The big push they’re doing is mostly behind the trading cards, which they say are the “coolest trading cards to grace your eyeballs and touch your fingertips.” Wow, it sounds like I wrote that. Although, I probably would have said “touch your eyeballs” or to give it even more of a vaguely creepy sound. There are 200 cards featuring Dreamcast art that you can smear across your retina. You can buy a hobby box with 20 cards for $24.99 or a booster box with 120 cards for $124.99.


Image via Limited Run Games


I don’t collect cards and never have. Is that normal pricing for trading cards? The booster packs look like VMUs and there are some cool card storage options. Hold on, I can’t get over the price. And then you can pay for sleeves and a box?


The other gear seems a lot more reasonable to me. There’s a skateboard deck for $74.99, a pin, a coin, and a keychain. There’s a hat for $31.99 and a hoodie for $54.99, which seem like fair prices. Everything seems priced right, but the cards give me pause. But, like I said, I know nothing about trading cards. They should have made it a CCG so we could pit Crazy Taxi against Space Channel 5.


Pre-orders are open now, with the shipping date for the items predicted for March 2025. That production time sounds very Limited Run Games. I’m not throwing shade. I like LRG for the most part, but you grow to expect long lead times.

Like most Roblox tower defense games, there are tons of units but not much of an indication as to which ones are worth getting.  We've put together this Anime Vanguards Tier List to show you which units you should try and get right away.

Anime Vanguards Tier List for all Units


With dozens of different units and evolutions in Anime Vanguards, it can be tricky to determine which units you should be going for. A good rule of thumb is the higher the rarity/quality, the better the unit. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Some Epic quality units are incredibly strong while some Legendary units are a bit on the weaker side.


The units we've put in the S Tier are the best units currently in Anime Vanguards and you should strive for long-term. Units in the A Tier are solid all around as well and will complete most content currently available. Units in the B tier are mostly Epic quality units, including Support units, which have their own unique strengths. Units in the C tier are very weak and other than starting units, should be replaced as soon as possible. This is our Anime Vanguards Tier List for all Units at launch:




S Tier



Alucard (Secret)


Cha-In (Mythic)


Igros (Secret)


Obita (Mythic)


Norutu (Six Tails) (Mythic)


Song Jinwu (Mythic)



A Tier



Goju (Mythic)


Haruka (Mythic)


Kinaru (Legendary)

Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No light to illuminate our paths.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is absolutely stuffed to the brim with characters, mechanics, enemies, and things to do. However, one glaring omission is Kass, Breath of the Wild's travelling Rito minstrel. Luckily for fans, the recently released Master Works Book does propose a few scenarios as to where Kass may be in the sequel.
Zelda Lore shared an excerpt of the book on Twitter (thanks to Gaming Reinvented for the tip) which covers the potential whereabouts of Kass in Tears of the Kingdom. The bird isn't present in Hyrule at all in the game, with no explanation at all given for his absence. He's not even mentioned. At least, until the Master Works book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starr Park's renowned sushi chef Kenji is about to make his grand entrance as Brawl Stars' Legendary Assassin. With his mighty sword and a versatile set of skills, he's all set to carve his way to victory. So, if you are ready to try this character out, here's when to expect Kenji's release date in Brawl Stars. 


Brawl Stars Kenji release date


According to the SpongeBob SquarePants update announcement, Kenji will be released on Sept. 26, 2024. If it's anything like Moe, he'll likely launch as a pre-release bundle, requiring a premium purchase from the Shop. However, you can try to save your gems for a later launch on the Starr Road, expected around Oct. 3.


Screenshot via Brawl Stars YouTube


Although Kenji has yet to arrive in Brawl Stars, Supercell has already given us the lowdown on his upcoming features. One of his standouts is his regenerative trait that replenishes his health after hitting an enemy. You'll use this with his Dash 'N' Slash strike, covering a wide range of AoE.


As you build your way up to his Super, Kenji unleashes devastating attacks that grant him temporary invincibility. But the real power lies in your hands with Kenji's Star Power. You have the choice between Studied the Blade or Nigiri Nemesis. The former is perfect for those who prefer long-range attacks, while the latter offers a 90 percent damage reduction for the next enemy strike. The choice all depends on your unique playstyle and whether you lean towards offensive or defensive strategies.


Kenji's Brawl Stars debut is not the only thing to look forward to. You can also unlock his exclusive Fruit Samurai skin, adding a unique touch to his build. And that's not all. The SpongeBob season, which will still be active at the time of Kenji's release, offers more rare skins. So, while you wait for the new Brawler, you can start stocking up on some Krusty Kash and earn additional rewards for your team before the event concludes on Oct. 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Valorant mobile leak has surfaced online and shows certain features that are yet to arrive on the PC version of the game.


This new leak shows some advanced training modes that include jump peeking and jiggle peeking. Jiggle and jump peeking are some gameplay mechanics that PC and console players implement during matches to gather info on opponent positions.


These types of peekings expose a little part of the Agent's character model for a brief period. Unlike dry peeking (that exposes the entire character model), jiggle and jump peeking reduce the chances of getting shot by an enemy, as the movement pattern is unexpected and random.




PC players have learned this by trial-and-error, mostly from pros while watching a professional match or livestreams of their favorite players. Allowing mobile players to learn this from a training mode will only jump-start their performance during matches when it finally launches at a later date.


Riot bringing these features to this version of Valorant only signifies how serious they are with the mobile port. At the time of writing, it's unclear when and if the devs ever decide to bring these features to Valorant PC or consoles.


However, if they do end up bringing them to current platforms (like they did with the revamped training range that first arrived on consoles and later on PC), it will benefit new players as they'll be ready with some of the most important movement mechanics that you need to use during matches.


The most requested feature from Valorant mobile is the replay system. It's already present in other shooters, Rainbow Six Siege being a prime example, it would undoubtedly help the majority of the player base to analyze and improve their gameplay.

There was some deserved hype surrounding Capcom’s first Fighting Collection, preserving the best of Street Fighter and Darkstalkers, and including a delicious Red Earth bonus for good measure. The furore across the internet upon the announcement of the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, however, seemed to burn twice as bright.
Featuring seven titles, there’s nothing but gold across the board. It includes every pixel-drawn Marvel fighting game up to and including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and all arcade originals. Capcom has ploughed the package with bonuses, from beautifully defined CRT filters and music players to original arcade art galleries, region switching, superb training modes, save states, and 4:3 screen bezels. For online play, Capcom's own rollback netcode is present and working fluidly. Although we can’t comment on how it will hold up when the servers go global, we’re optimistic it will be well maintained. You can hop in and out of matches, take on casual and ranked match-ups, and spectate freely. It’s quite the fighting festival, and buffed to a shine.

For the console version, there is a modern frontend you can play with. It makes the graphics look more in line with the cartoon. Beyond just overlapping the 8-bit backbone, everything is animated in a way you might expect from a modern 2D platformer, complete with background effects like parallax scrolling. However, it’s all built on top of a game made to run on hardware that first hit the market in 1983. That’s how it plays; it’s an NES game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Fortnite's best ways to find new weapons is to open treasure chests. While regular treasure chests can give you quick access to a few guns or consumables, rare ones are where your powerful weapons lie. Fortunately, there's one easy way to find several during every match.


Where to find rare chests in Fortnite


Rare chests are guaranteed to spawn in any weapon bunkers that appear during your Fortnite matches. After around three Storm circle phases, they'll blare their sirens and open their doors, unveiling the contents within. Every bunker has three rare chests, weapon cases, and modding benches you can use to fine-tune your setup.

These chests can also replace normal ones during your matches. Although this happens randomly and varies per round, visiting golden landmarks or POIs like Doomstadt, The Raft, and Castle Doom gives you solid odds of finding at least one random rare chest somewhere. If you want the guarantee, you'll need to enter a few bunkers.


Rare chests appear as small blue variants of regular treasure chests you'll commonly find around the map. They also glow bright and are generally harder to find. Using the audio radial wheel also makes them easier to find, much like with regular chests.


All weapon bunker locations


As of Chapter 5, Season 4, there are nine weapon bunkers that have a chance of opening per match:



Southwest of The Underworld


Southwest of Grim Gate


South of The Raft


One west of Doomstadt


Another directly east of Doomstadt


North of Reckless Railways


Another south of Reckless Railways


Northwest of Mount Olympus


South of the Nitrodome



Each POI has at least one nearby bunker. However, only a few of them will open during each match, so you can't rely on visiting the same bunker every time.

Checked for new codes! 




Slimes might seem small and easy to kill, but in Slime Slaying Simulator, you're faced with killing so many in a world packed with them that they'll become the bane of your existence. In these vast worlds, fighting slimes is a noble cause for which you're handsomely rewarded. 


While the game's name might make you think of a cheap knock-off Dragon Quest title, this Roblox game is far from it. In Slime Slaying Simulator, you're taught the basics and then are sent out into the world to kill slimes, earn new gear, and unlock new parts of the world so you can conquer the Slime Queen and many more monstrous enemies. You can even hatch friendly slimes to help tackle the bigger enemies and ensure the world is saved from a sticky, gooey end…]]></summary>

Yooka-Replaylee was a bit of a welcome surprise when it was announced back in June. It looks utterly gorgeous and promises plenty of tweaks, changes, and accessibility features when it eventually launches. But one thing that many fans spotted was Laylee, Yooka's purple bat companion, and her new, incredibly fluffy design.
In a Q&A published on the Playtonic YouTube Channel, community manager Steve James sat down with members of the Yooka-Replaylee art team — Ed Bryan, Nikita De Ruysscher, and Steve Mayles — to talk about the game's brand new look. And one section focuses on the wisecracking bat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's-a not!
Researchers from tech company Virtuals Protocol have published a paper on a new text-to-video AI model, MarioVGG, which can simulate Super Mario Bros. footage via some basic text inputs (thanks, ArsTechnica).
The model was fed over 737,000 Mario Bros. frames, showing Nintendo's prized plumber in 32 different levels with varying degrees of success and failure (141 wins and 139 losses, according to Github). Based on these images, and how they are arranged, the AI model "learns" what commands such as "jump" and "run" correspond to on-screen and is then capable of simulating such commands in a video format, physics and all.

The leaves flake from the boughs like the dandruff of Pan, god of the wild - pandruff, perhaps? The waters of the rivers thicken, rejecting the fading sunlight, and the big coffee chains start doing monstrous things with hazelnut syrup. The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent. Fortunately, this week is looking quite bountiful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, if this isn’t a vastly impressive little gem I’m not sure what is. Qanga is a space exploration game set in a loading screen-less solar system. It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

That’s according to creative director Julian Gerighty, who recently spoke to GamesRadar+ about what players should expect in the next update, coming “maybe in 10 days.”

This is a new version of Ira, a hero card that anyone can get by heading down to their local game store and participating in a 5th anniversary celebration event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Daily Spin has once again made its return to NBA 2K25's MyCareer mode, and it could be the source of some amazing freebies to aid you on your journey.


One of the foremost vital resources to grind in MyCareer is VCs, which is the premium currency of the game. Of course, you can buy them with the help of microtransactions, but not everyone likes to spend money after paying a premium for the game itself. The daily spin might not always drop bountiful rewards, but you get something on a daily basis. The gifts can range from VCs to essential items like skill boosts, but they all count.


NBA 2K25 Daily Spin location guide


You can try out the Daily Spin right after creating your MyPlayer.



Go through the first phase of playing in the Finals.


Once done, talk with your friend for the introductory dialog.


When you're ready, step out of MyCourt.


If you go right from MyCourt, you'll come across the Arena.


If you go left, you'll come across the "Crocs" store and find the two affiliations - Elite and Rise.


The Daily Spins are located right in front of affiliation entrances.


Step in front of one, and press the X/A button.


Wait for a bit for the rewards to show up. If you're unlucky like me, there won't be any VC. But many have found VC from their spins, and some have received large amounts as well.

Most importantly, the spin is free to draw; you just need to travel to the location and spin the draw. This is the easiest way to earn valuable resources to add to your inventory. While VCs help you grow your MyPlayer attributes, other items can help improve the finer aspects of your build.


If you're not happy with the amounts of freebies, there are microtransactions. The Season 1 pass also rewards you with lot of items that benefit your MyPlayer build.

Players have been modding Baldur's Gate 3 ever since it was initially released for PC. However, as of the launch of Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7, fans have a dedicated native mod manager and toolkit built into the game. This makes the game easier to mod than ever before, and that's almost certainly why so many players downloaded so many mods as soon as this update became available and was installed on their PCs.

I believe that the campaign is the best place to start with Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2. It'll teach you the basic mechanics while also giving you an epic story to experience that blew me away and continues to do so every time I replay a mission. However, it's a time commitment, and you're going to need to make sure you've got enough to get through it before you can even contemplate exploring the wider multiplayer offerings.

Mbappe didn't get a 99-rated version as part of FUTTIES, but his TOTT card is immensely meta. In my book, it ranks every other striker item (yes, even the 99-rated Pele and Eusebio). If you haven't been lucky enough to get him from packs, the card could be yours via the SBC.

The Kylian Mbappe TOTT SBC has 15 tasks, all with their own conditions.

The first of these, Mrs. Raccoon, comes with her own shop, and you don’t need Gold to purchase her wares.


Unlike other vendors in Stardew Valley, Mrs. Raccoon has no use for Gold and instead chooses to use a barter system. In exchange for junk and other items, you can get some rare items and seeds.

After completing the first request for Mr. Raccoon, his wife will show up the following day, and you’ll have access to her shop. The stock of her shop expands after completing each request for Mr. Raccoon, although she starts out with a selection of seeds that are usually obtained from Seed Spots.


In some cases, it’s possible to start with one item and barter up to much more useful items, such as the following:



Cave Carrot > Mixed Seeds > Raccoon Hat


Mystery Box > Golden Mystery Box > Magic Rock Candy



Here’s everything that she eventually sells, along with which request you’ll need to complete in order to unlock each item for purchase:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of the Blue Box manga can now mark their calendars, as the much-anticipated anime adaptation is set to debut on October 3, 2024. The series' official website recently unveiled a brand-new trailer and key visual to further heighten the excitement for this upcoming sports-romance anime. 


Alongside this announcement, the trailer offers a first listen to the opening and ending theme songs. Popular Japanese band Official Hige Dandism is performing the series’ opening theme titled "Same Blue." Meanwhile, Eve will provide the ending theme song, "Teenage Blue."




In addition to its television debut, Netflix will stream the first two episodes on October 3, with subsequent episodes following each television broadcast. However, the release schedule will vary depending on the region. The anime will also be available on a number of other sites, including Hulu and Prime Video.


For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Blue Box is a mix of sports and romance, though more focused on the latter. The plot is centered on Taiki Inomata — a member of the boys' badminton team at Eimei Junior and Senior High — and his crush Chinatsu Kano — an older girl on the basketball team. Most of their interactions are the usual greeting during their parallel morning training, yet their relationship takes a sudden turn when Chinatsu's family is forced to move.


Fans looking to dive into the story before the anime’s release can find the Blue Box manga available to read digitally on both VIZ Media’s platform and Shueisha’s MANGA Plus.

There were several moments in Nintendo's pre-launch Switch marketing that left us a little lost for words: the hybrid form factor, our first look at Breath of the Wild, the way that one guy went to "walk his dog" but spent the entire time sat on a bench.
The reveal that Skyrim would be coming to the iddy biddy console was another. By this point, it was a sure sign that this wasn't just Nintendo's kid-friendly affair, but a big, grow-up machine for those who wanted to play big, grown-up, six-year-old games. It was also a sign of the Switch's power, a wagging finger from Nintendo as if to say "You thought this was only going to run side-scrolling Mario levels? Think again".

I’ve been following the Silent Hill series ever since Konami included a demo for the original game in the original PAL package of Metal Gear Solid. Was that a more charitable Konami from a nicer time in gaming, or had the company been evil all along and was trying to get 10-year-old me to pee his pants?

It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop.

Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you forget about Baldur's Gate 3? Because Baldur's Gate 3 did not forget about you. Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover. This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest. And I enjoy a space game that makes me panic while alarms go off everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure: I hadn't heard of Bakeru until Graham mentioned it to me. Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm released last Tuesday, and hasn’t gone down too well with fans of the co-op roguelite. How not well, you ask? To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Most chilling of all, Aldi have discontinued their Village Bakery Seeded Medium Sliced Loaf (400g), replacing it with deeply inferior Village Bakery Lightly Seeded Loaf (800g). Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence. Until then, here are this week’s PC game releases of note.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The spectacular demise of Fmovies, Aniwave, and a dozen or more related big-brand pirate sites, has former users asking the same question: Are they really gone forever? With many resurrections and Dr. Who-like regenerations over recent years, some seem optimistic. Government records suggests that business bridges are being built from Hollywood to Vietnam, and back again. It seems unlikely that the resurrection of pirate sites would help in any way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite malware having an even worse reputation than piracy, until now police operations to take sites down, explicitly because they're involved in both, have been pretty much non-existent. This week, music industry group IFPI revealed Operation Redirect, "the first operation of its kind in Brazil to target illegal sites associated with malware distribution." Intrigued by the announcement, we took a closer look and found plenty of drama.

If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes you forget to build a graveyard. It happens. When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

As is customary, I must jam my new cat into every article. I’ve tried to offer her several books, but she’s failed to turn even a single page so far. What a big dumbo. The best dumbo. The sweetest, smartest dumbo in the world, yes she is. Ahem. This week, it’s Supermassive, Niantic, and Sensible Object narrative designer and Limit Break mentor, Anastasia Dukakis! Cheers Ana! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

I’m going to hang out with her a bunch and see if I can instill some sort of object permanence re: my presence in the home. Before that, let’s read this week’s best writing about games (and game related things!)

Enter Steam reviews. Reviews from players who primarily played on Steam Deck will now have a little Deck icon, which when moused over tells you the exact amount of time spent on the Deck.

Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Age of Empires with dinosaurs" is, the developers of the Dinolords recently told me in a cramped Gamescom booth, a flattering description for their upcoming England vs. Vikingsaurus RTS. It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

It takes place in 14th century England, and tasks you with fending off the rampant zombie hordes of a populace who've succumbed to a mysterious case of reanimation. Perhaps the cause is that there's no Maccies or TK Maxx at the local Bull Ring yet.

It’s a real...pane.
Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?
