        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get over here?
It looks like NetherRealm's next project has been officially confirmed as Mortal Kombat 12, and in a bit of an unconventional way: during an earnings call.
Speaking on an earnings call today, Warner Bros. head David Zaslav confirms that Mortal Kombat 12 is in the works. The comment arrived during a section where Zaslav was discussing the success of gaming efforts under WB:
"[...] And there's lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections."

The mention of Mortal Kombat 12 comes as a bit of a surprise as, well, that hasn't really been talked about up to this point. We've heard rumors that NetherRealm Studios was forgoing a new Injustice entry to keep the MK train going, and even seen some teases from Ed Boon on the matter, but nothing official had been confirmed prior to today's call. Now, it looks like a new Mortal Kombat isn't just on the way, but for this year too.
We've reached out to Warner Bros. for clarification, and will share more as we learn more.
Cue the Mortal Kombat theme
It hasn't been too long since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 in 2019. The entry brought the time-hopping adventures of the rebooted MK universe to a neat close, but NetherRealm continued to update Mortal Kombat 11 afterwards with both the Aftermath story and the Ultimate edition. There's a blank slate open for the future of the story, at least.
Add on the fact that Mortal Kombat reclaimed a main stage spot for this year's Evo fighting game tournament series, and you could definitely retroactively justify some red-yarn-conspiracy. Still, to have Mortal Kombat 12 dropped so casually in an earnings call? It certainly doesn't make for a boring news day. Hopefully we'll see more soon about what NetherRealm's up to with this new Mortal Kombat.

When it was released in 2021, Perfect Gold was something of a surprise to me. It was a yuri visual novel that I connected with, even though I’ve never exactly had any relatable experiences. Perfect Gold was earnest, honest, and sweet. It was a story of people who shared a romance, not about a romance between two people.
So, I kept the developer, Yangyang Mobile, earmarked to watch out for. I believe they were, at the time, already working on Saint Maker, and I didn’t know what to respect. As it turns out, we have a different genre, different themes, and a different writer, but the same earnestness tucked away inside.
I’ll take it.

The long-delayed release of Goodbye, Volcano High is finally upon us. As part of Sony’s February 2023 State of Play, KO_OP has revealed that its doors will open on June 15, 2023.
Dropping along with this bit of news is a trailer that shows us some of the dramatic tension our dinosaur teens are going to get into. Goodbye, Volcano High wraps your typical high school stories of relationships, rock bands, and the impending demise of civilization into a narrative game that is also showing off some of its rhythm game chops.

I haven’t been paying too much attention to Goodbye, Volcano High, but it’s looking pretty good to me. I like the aesthetic, I like the music, and I like rhythm games. My only issue is that some of the imagery and dialogue remind me of my high school experience, which was a horrific parade of trauma that I’m still sweeping up after. Please excuse me while I go dry heave up all my latent anxiety for a moment.
Goodbye, Volcano High is coming to PS4, PS5, and PC on June 15, 2023.

Sony has just wrapped its first State of Play for 2023, showing off what's in store for the PlayStation 5 and its newly released PlayStation VR2 headset. There were some usual suspects, but also a decent number of pleasant surprises.
From the release date and console debut of Baldur's Gate 3 to that wild, wacky-looking new Enhance game, there were definitely a few reveals that caught us off guard. Other parts of the State of Play were a little more what you'd expect, but even then, I'm not going to turn my nose up at more Street Fighter 6 footage, especially with both Zangief and Cammy looking fantastic in the new entry.
Here's all the news to know from today's show.

As part of Sony’s State of Play, Capcom dropped a trailer showing off some more Street Fighter 6 characters in action. All of these characters were part of the art leak, so try and look surprised.
[embed]https://youtu.be/8AM3PfmG1tk[/embed]
First up, we have veteran Zangief. This wrestleman will be a welcome sight to anyone who likes to roll their joystick around. Also, anyone who has an appreciation for chest hair. The trailer shows off his spinning lariats, drop kicks, and ridiculous piledriver.
Next up is Lily. Hailing from Mexico, Lily is one of the new characters for the series. She’s a lot more subdued than the raging Russian. She calls on the spirit of the wind but then also blinds Blanka with a camera.
Finally, there’s Cammy, who has decided to show up in more than just a bathing suit. She also comes equipped with a wide selection of kicks, including her signature Cannon Drill.
Street Fighter 6 arrives June 2, 2023, for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Metropolis serves as the game’s open-world sandbox, and the adventure can be enjoyed alone or with up to three other friends in co-op (requiring an internet connection for both and supports cross-play). The video presentation highlights each Squad member’s traits. Harley Quinn is the most acrobatic, sporting a grappling hook to swing across buildings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.
The arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.
Likewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.
Lily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.
Street Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.]]></summary>

As part of Sony’s State of Play stream, Capcom has announced the demo for the Resident Evil 4 remake. It’s “coming soon.”
Along with it is a new trailer that showcases a lot of Resident Evil 4’s zanier moments. It shows off a lot of familiar scenes from the classic title with all the modern flourishes. We also hear from characters like Luis Sera, Ramon Salazar, and Jack Krauser. There's some minecart riding, villain taunting, and gunfighting fun. There's also a bunch with Ashley, as it looks like you'll not only protect her but also play some portions as her.

The Resident Evil 4 remake is arriving March 24, 2023 for PS4, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The demo is presumably coming before that.

If you missed the live stream, here's a refresher.
  



      
												
Foglands
Described on the PlayStation Blog as a "western sci-fi roguelike," Foglands was the first game shown at the livestream today. Developed by an indie studio called Well Told, the game has you fighting monsters, grabbing loot, and trying to escape from danger before you're swallowed by the Fog. Foglands releases later this year.

Revealed as part of today's PlayStation State of Play, the latest RPG from Larian is getting a console version to coincide with the 1.0 PC launch on August 31.

Luis is present in way more of the game now – he's shown with Leon in the minecart section (also we see the minecart section) – we get a brief look at the Krauser fight, more detailed views of combat, the late section of the game that goes full Call of Duty (which is and has always been good), some brief glimpses of Ashley's sections, and a tease for Mercenaries. Okay, the trailer is below. There's a lot more I didn't type out because you aren't reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends. The game looks great.

In Humanity, you play as a dog-thing that leads an absolute fleet of generic humans through geometric stages. The trailer showed off obstacles such as water, fans, and even opposing fleets of humans. On top of the adventure included in the game, you’re able to create and share your own levels.
The whole aesthetic reminds me of PS2-era Japanese games. It’s an abstract gameplay-first concept that you rarely see in the mainstream. Humanity is coming to PS4 PS5 sometime in May and as support for both versions of PSVR. A demo for it will be dropping today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accompanied by a somber cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police,” Bungie rolled out a new look at Lightfall during today’s Sony State of Play presentation, and shared the expansion's launch trailer.
In this latest trailer, we get several new glimpses of the narrative that lies ahead in the expansion. If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.
It’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.
We won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rev up those VR headsets
Both Nintendo and Xbox have broken the seal on 2023, and now it's PlayStation's turn. Today, Sony is airing its first PlayStation State of Play for 2023.
The stream goes live at 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT on the PlayStation streaming channels. You can also watch via the embed below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGkP6D5lJcw
The show is expected to have a decent number of announcements, ranging from virtual reality to indies and big, blockbuster games. So what are we looking forward to for this particular stream?
The state of play in 2023
Sony has already pretty well-established that this is going to be a stream laden with third-party news. The headliner is Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and we're expecting to see a chunk of gameplay for the upcoming Rocksteady game. Given its new release date is just a few months away, this should hopefully lock the date in for good.
PlayStation VR2 is also set to play a big role in today's stream. Five games coming to PS VR2 later this year are going to get shown off. While hopes are high that some big names may make a console debut, it's probably worth keeping expectations in check for what Sony will show for its brand-new headset.
Lastly, we are also going to get "new looks" at anticipated games from third-party partners. There are a number of usual suspects that have made previous PlayStation stream appearances and are due to launch this year, like Street Fighter 6 and Final Fantasy XVI. Plus, never discount a little indie surprise.
Today's stream is, much like the Xbox Developer Direct and Nintendo Direct, a tone-setter going forward. 2023 still feels a bit uncertain for Sony's console aside from Marvel's Spider-Man 2, but today we'll hopefully see some updates on what the future holds, both for PS5 and its brand-new VR headset.

[Update: Well, "soon" ended up being three months! You can find both of the below rewards on this My Nintendo page.]
Another first part Nintendo release: another My Nintendo reward. This time Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is getting an expected physical item release, and it actually entails two things.
Here's all we know at the moment:
"Two new rewards - Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet partner pokemon mini-notebook and Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet violet highlighter with case are coming. Stay tuned for more info."

The notebook is adorned with iconography of the new generational starters, and the highlighter set is themed after the two legendaries (and the coloring of Scarlet and Violet itself). It's hard to say what point value these could clock in at when they hit the system, but count on at least 500 Platinum Points per item.
Also, it's very important to note that nearly all Pokemon items (even the crossover keychain with Splatoon 3) "sell out" of My Nintendo stock shortly after they launch. Make sure you have the points for the one(s) you want!
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

The Pokémon franchise is no stranger to excellent spinoffs. Between the lauded Mystery Dungeon crossovers, the well-regarded (if seldom played) Pokkén Tournament, and, of course, the cultural juggernaut that is Pokémon GO, there's been a Pokémon game for just about every genre imaginable. Once upon a time, there were even two excellent Pokémon pinball games.
The original Pokémon Pinball is something of an oddity, even when viewed amid the eclectic Game Boy Color library. Released three years after the first Pokémon generation in Japan, and just a few months before Pokémon Yellow arrived in North America, the game was little more than two digital pinball tables with Pokémon theming. The two tables were "Red" and "Blue," and they were excellent.

The Knight Witch, last year's fun and frantic mash-up of bullet hell action and Metroidvania exploration, has just received a brand new update on Switch. Publisher Team17 has shared all of the details for the patch over on its blog.
Super Awesome Hyper Dimensional Mega Team's fast-paced action game — in our own words — "mixes things up a bit" and is a refreshing take on the Metroidvania genre. But we did note some technical issues, including soft locks, in our review. But, with today's update, it looks like a lot of those early issues may well be magicked away.

The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!

Beyond the Long Night is a dual-stick side-scroller featuring rogue-lite elements and adventure puzzle-solving. If dual-stick side-scroller strikes you as a bit odd, the explanation is that you float around with a cluster of balloons. I still have a lot of balloon-related trauma stemming from Mario Kart and Balloon Kid, but even despite all the agonizing flashbacks, Beyond the Long Night looks like charming fun.

In Beyond the Long Night, you will explore the monster-filled Dark Mountain to discover the secrets of a corrupting force. Not unlike many roguelites, you find yourself stuck in a time-loop, but the game’s cast of colorful characters remember you throughout each one. The level is built of a randomized assortment of hand-crafted rooms, some containing puzzles.
I find the graphics to be charming in a Downwell or Cave Story sort of way. I’m not sure what it is about the gameplay, but watching through some of it was enough to put Beyond the Long Night firmly on my radar, even if I’m not necessarily a lover of roguelites.
Beyond the Long Night is coming to PC on April 13. If you’d like to get airborne before then, a demo is available on Steam.

Clear some space on the nacho cheese-stained carpet, as Wired Productions' Arcade Paradise is receiving a trio of new games today as part of its second paid DLC pack. This pack will allow you to glut up your arcade with three all-new cabinets.
The new cabinets added are R.O.G.E.R., Penguin Push, and Summer of Sports. All of these are fictional games, sometimes based on real-world classics. Penguin Push, for example, seems very similar to the original-flavored Mario Bros., and Summer of Sports smells like Konami’s Track & Field series. As for R.O.G.E.R., I’m drawing a blank.
[embed]https://youtu.be/Xf1n1eh1iDs[/embed]
These will be joining the three games from DLC pack 1 and the licensed title Kung Fury: Street Rage, as well as the 35 games already included in the base game. Alongside them come new challenges, rewards, and leaderboards.
I was somewhat lukewarm on Arcade Paradise when I reviewed it last year. My main grievances weren’t really on the games included within, as they provided a nice variety, and I found a few that fit my tastes. It was more that the management side of things didn’t play well with the concept of having all these mini-games. I can already buy giant compilations of arcade games, but a metagame that ties it all together is something I still crave.
Arcade Paradise is available on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. DLC Pack 2 launches today, and its included cabinets are available to buy as a set or à la carte.

Independent developer Moon Studios is seemingly gambling a lot on its next release, suggesting that the performance of the unannounced new title could "make or break" the studio.
Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler made the stark comments on Twitter when discussing the ARPG title, which was first announced three years ago and has been in steady development since. The mystery project will not only see the studio take a break from its much beloved Ori series, but will also see Moon move away from Xbox exclusivity and into the wider world of platforms, courtesy of publisher Private Division.
"Our next project is going to be a make-or-break moment for Moon," wrote Mahler on Twitter. "Either we manage to revolutionize the ARPG genre or we’ll slowly…]]></summary>

Publisher The Arcade Crew has revealed that The Last Spell will be leaving Early Access on 9th March, and that means it's also coming to consoles the same day — Switch included.
Developed by Ishtar Games, The Last Spell blends tactical RPG elements with procedurally generated gear and foes and tops it all off with a beautiful pixel art style and a heavy metal soundtrack. Definitely not a game for a quiet evening, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony’s PlayStation VR2 launched today with only a handful of proper exclusives. Horizon Call of the Mountain is the big showcase piece for the hardware, and Gran Turismo 7 has been updated to include impressive VR modes. Outside of those first-party games, however, the launch library is mostly made of previously released VR games. The one other major exception is from Capcom, which has made Resident Evil Village playable entirely in PlayStation VR2 with a free update.
Resident Evil 7 received a similar PlayStation VR port in 2017, but I found playing that game in VR underwhelming. It was released early in the VR lifecycle when the basic mechanics of the new platform were still being worked out, and you had to play with a controller. It wasn’t ideal. The recent VR remake of Resident Evil 4,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planning ahead for spending
Steam Sales and Fests are an opportune moment for PC owners to fill up their gaming backlog. And Valve is taking a little bit of the guesswork and speculation out of the Steam Sale schedule for 2023.
In a blog, Valve outlines the schedule for 2023 in terms of Steam Sales and Fests. The former is self-explanatory, as Steam Sales entail big, sweeping discounts throughout Valve's digital storefront, usually with some deep cuts into price tags. Fests are themed celebrations that do usually have discounts, but also bring in some thematic celebration or even a slew of new demos for upcoming games. From genre-focused celebrations to the increasingly popular Next Fest demo onslaught, these Steam Festivals are fun spotlights into the ever-growing Steam catalog.
Whether it's the big seasonal sales or a collection of what's to come from smaller developers, this schedule should at least help out in knowing what's on the way. Here's the full 2023 lineup.
2023 Steam Sale and Fest schedule
Mystery Fest: February 20 - 27
Spring Sale: March 16 - 23
Puzzle Fest: April 24 - May 1
Sports Fest: May 15 - 22
Next Fest: June 19 - 26
Summer Sale: June 29 - July 13
Stealth Fest: July 24 - 31
Visual Novel Fest: August 7 - 14
Strategy Fest: August 28 - September 4
SHMUP Fest: September 25 - October 2
Next Fest: October 9 - 16
Return of Steam Scream Fest (Halloween): October 26 - November 2
Autumn Sale: November 21 - 28
Winter Sale: December 21 - January 4, 2024
Now you've got an easy way to plan ahead and make some cost-saving choices around those big events. Because really, what is a Steam Sale if not an excellent way to pile on-top of your insurmountable backlog?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a touch of poetry to the way Wild Hearts carves so liberally from Monster Hunter. After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. 


Besides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.

It's an interesting week for the Nintendo eShop, as a first-party release and a third-party game battle for attention. The former is of course Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe: a re-release (with extras) of the 2011 Wii entry. Then there's Octopath Traveler II, which is a pretty huge release for Square Enix, and has a baked-in fanbase at this point. Both of those are due out on February 24.
In other news, Redemption Reapers is coming out today, and Katamari Damacy Reroll is getting a full game trial for Switch Online + Expansion Pack members until February 26 at 11:59PM PT. There's quite a lot to mess around with! You can find the full eShop breakdown below.

A brand new animated short for Pokémon is releasing in China the day after Pokémon Day called 'Journey of Dreams'. Spotted by Serebii, the short will debut on 28th February, and the reveal poster has got us all feeling a bit nostalgic.
The Pokémon Company knows just how to tap into our nostalgia, and the debut poster — shared on Chinese social network site Weibo (thanks, PokéJungle!) — features a young boy looking up at all sorts of Pokémon and environments, all while holding a Game Boy in his hands. In front of him, you can spot a GBA, a Game Boy Color, a DS, and a DS Lite, and if you're Pokémon fans like us, you've likely owned almost every single one of those.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know it’s a great turn in The Pale Beyond when only five of your crew are freezing, two have frostbite, and one has scurvy. After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.
It’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.

Remasters are fantastic, but they're also a little bit weird. They give us the chance to revisit some of our favourite games from our childhood, give new players the opportunity to share in our experiences, and sometimes they represent the first time a game is getting an international release. But why are they so inconsistent?
It's worth laying out that we're looking solely at remasters — games that have been polished up and given some TLC (hopefully) — rather than remakes, which involve rewriting the entire game code to recreate or act as a reimagining of the games we grew up with (So no Live A Live or Link's Awakening, here).

We ask ourselves: why are there so many hell-themed games and so few heavenly ones? Is it blasphemy? What would our pitch for a game set in heaven be? (Spoilers for that last one: there's a lot of admin involved). We also chat about what we've been playing this week, and Nate orchestrates a mini-game pitchathon that goes at least somewhat off the rails.

But, every now and then, an especially deep discount will catch my eye, my bad impulses wake up, and I spend a few quid on something I won’t touch for six months (seriously, Abzu has been floating on my hard drive for years.) My New Year's resolution won’t hold out for much longer, as Valve have announced their schedule for all of 2023’s Steam Fests and sales events.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.
Bethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn't cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: 
Mikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.
It's unclear what Mikami will do next, but he's leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango's portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here's our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we're excited to see what's next for the veteran designer.]]></summary>

Fans were less than happy with the end result, pointing toward technical issues, randomness in the endgame, and a lack of crafting systems, which Fatshark are hoping to fix in today’s update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Book of Demons makes an appearance too
March isn't going to set the world on fire when it comes to free Prime Gaming offerings, but it does have a few sweet spots. Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition leads the charge, alongside of Adios, I am Fish, Faraway 3: Arctic Escape, Book of Demons, Peaky Blinders: Mastermind, and City Legends: Trapping in Mirror - Collector's Edition. That last one is a "Hidden-Object Puzzle Adventure," and I LOVE getting those for free.
Of course the main event is Baldur's Gate. Released in 2013, the Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate has ended up settling in really well in recent years, and also has the Siege of Dragonspear expansion available if you want to go further with it. This is a no-brainer: grab it immediately, even if you have no intention of playing it for years on end. It still holds up, and a lot of that CRPG formula is lost to the ether; unintentionally forging an evergreen experience you can't get from many modern games.

Nintendo Switch Online's Missions & Rewards scheme has been a little bit quiet recently. While the system is currently mopping up the last of the Fire Emblem Engage icons and is keeping up with Animal Crossing: New Horizons birthdays, we've had no new set in February. But that might be about to change in March.
Ridley Revolution, who runs a 'support campaign' for Ridley from the Metroid series, was tipped off about some Metroid Prime Remastered icons by fellow Twitter user 3Dburn. Apparently, some Japanese fans who have bought the remaster have been sent an email from Nintendo saying that Metroid Prime Remastered icons will be added to the Missions & Rewards service from 3rd March to 17th March.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Double Switch.
From Inti Creates, developers of the critically acclaimed Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon duo and the Mega Man Zero/ZX series, comes a new Metroidvania rendered in a 16-bit graphical style, utilising modern hardware for various special effects, animation, and sprite creation. And it’s a fine-looking game, overall. While some areas are a tad bland, others, like the theatre backdrop and haunted galleon, are visually opulent. In terms of detail and general beauty, however, it falls a way short of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night’s gothic showboating.
There’s a touch of knowing satire in Grim Guardians: Demon Purge's narrative setup. When two sisters find themselves cast in a demonic netherworld university altogether different from their own, they need to pair up to battle their way to the spire, defeat cute demoness Kurona, rescue their school friends, and return to their realm of sunlight and Seifuku. Playfully aware of how the schoolgirl-turned-heroine trope has been done to death, it plays light with the premise.

Most city-builders are about expanding and growing. The goal is to take a natural, untamed world and bend it to your benefit, turning the realm into a humming machine for resources and production. Terra Nil, however, does the inverse.
Rather than creating a monument to your designs, Terra Nil is a reverse city-builder from BroForce studio Free Lives. It asks you to take the barren, scorched earth and fill it with life. You restore the grasslands, let water flow down canals, and crack the earth to restore the ecosystem. And then, at the end, you pack up and leave, with only nature in your wake.

Prepare your disc-slots, as Kaizen Game Works' neon-sleuthing adventure Paradise Killer will be getting a physical release via Serenity Forge in the third quarter of 2023. This is in addition to the Switch version, whose physical prison is being provided by 1Print Games. However, their limited edition is lacking in one important area: tits.
Now that I have your attention, I feel it’s important to point out that the Serenity Forge Collector’s Edition comes with a mouse pad prominently featuring Crimson Acid’s divine rack. There are some other things in there, like acrylic standees, stickers, and an OST download card, but those all pale in comparison to the inviting bosom of the demon-headed sex idol.

If you’re unfamiliar with Paradise Killer, it’s a free-roaming detective game soaked in weirdities. I loved it for its excellent characters, outstanding writing, and open approach to investigation. I think my only real complaint about it was a rather drab open world. However, it still rents space in my head, and I keep getting the urge to replay it.
As someone who passionately loved Paradise Killer back at launch, this is a really tempting package for me. Not sure I’ll go for the Collector’s Edition. Listen, Crimson Acid is certainly more fuckable than a chocolate éclair, but I’m not sure I need to nestle my wrist in her ergonomic cleavage. That sounds… sweaty.
Paradise Killer is available on Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC. The Switch Physical version is available now from 1Print Games, while the titular PlayStation and Xbox versions will be hitting retail from Serenity Forge.

The official Among Us Twitter page has shared a cryptic teaser about an upcoming collaboration, and eagle-eyed fans of a particular space shooter have gathered that it could be referring to Bungie's Destiny 2.
A message reading, "HMMM found an incoming message about some Impostors that might be hiding among a certain fireteam very soon..." was posted to the game's Twitter account on February 21, but had no further information included. Various silhouettes were also featured in an image that accompanied the tweet and the phrase "Eyes up, crewmate." Destiny 2's Commander Zavala has the catchphrase, "Eyes up, Guardian," which fans have taken to mean the teaser definitely refers to Destiny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pen is mightier
Plastic carnage is coming to Steam Early Access on March 17 by way of Joystick Ventures and Kraken Empire’s Toy Tactics.
Toy Tactics is described as a “family-friendly, physics-based RTS” where you draw on the map to direct your troops. I’m going to stop you there because the moment you let me draw anything, it’s going to stop being family-friendly. At best, I’m going to draw a butt. My flag in Animal Crossing? A butt. It’s inevitable.
[embed]https://youtu.be/BwryoUr8LTU[/embed]
On top of confronting your enemies with the dreaded butt-formation, you’ll also cast spells to add catapults, walls, and meteors to aid your troops. You can choose Imperium, Pendragon, and Kyoukai armies, each with their own unique abilities. The single-player campaign will have your forces traversing “Draugr infested Europe and Japan.”
Whenever these toy-based games come up, I always hope they really go off the deep end in terms of taking advantage of the theme. It’s certainly looking like Toy Tactics is going that route by throwing in samurai alongside ancient European factions. However, I won’t be happy until I see a few robots and toy kaiju stomping all over the battlefield.
Toy Tactics will hit Steam Early Access on March 17. No word yet on how long it plans to remain there, but you can check out the demo right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking right over the minefield sign
Valve confirms it has permanently banned over 40,000 accounts associated with a known cheat in Dota 2. And it did so by creating a trap laid specifically just to lure users of that specific cheat out.
In a blog entitled "Cheaters Will Never Be Welcome in Dota," Valve outlines how exactly this came to be. The company doesn't name the cheat or what it did, but does confirm that the software was able to access information used internally by the Dota 2 client that "wasn't visible during normal gameplay."
Though fixing the cheat was important, Valve also decided to remove those using the cheat from the active playerbase. So as soon as the studio understood the methodology behind the cheat, Valve issued a patch that created a honeypot. A section of game data inside the client would never be read during normal gameplay, but it could be read by the cheats.
As you might imagine, this cordoned-off area created a ledger of users who were using the exploit. Valve says it has "extremely high confidence" that every ban was "well-deserved."
The ongoing fight with cheats
As Valve highlights, the tussle between developers and cheat-creators wages ever-on in the shadows. While some efforts get the spotlight, especially when they head to court, it's fascinating to see behind the curtain a bit on how Valve identified and trapped a bunch of cheat-users.
"We expect that some players will continue to develop and use new exploits, to continue to try to gain unfair advantages at the expense of other players," reads today's blog. "As before, we will continue to detect and remove these exploits as they come, and continue to ban users who cheat."
Right now, the Dota 2 Lima Major is taking place, and a new update is set to be unveiled on March 6. For those who decide to jump back in, they can do so knowing there are roughly 40,000 less cheaters in the pool.

Publisher Serenity Forge has announced that visual novel adventure Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! has sold over one million copies since its initial launch on PC and consoles in the summer of 2021.
Doki Doki Literature Club puts players in the role of a new student, begrudgingly roped into joining their new school's poetry club, where they meet fellow teenage scribes Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and the club's president, Monika. The expanded Plus! edition features the original game in its entirety, freshly polished with remastered visuals, as well as a glut of new features and additional side stories, providing the ultimate romantic experience for both new and returning fans.
https://twitter.com/TeamSalvato/status/1628168687680393216?s=20
"These past five years, seeing my writing reach so many people has helped to shape who I am," said original creator Dan Salvato of the sales. "I feel so connected to every Doki Doki Literature Club! fan I have the privilege of meeting. In my gratitude to all our supporters, I’m committed to using our funding from Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! to support mental health nonprofits, as well as to make new boundary-breaking games that can create connection and meaning for even more people."
Initially launched as a Steam indie release back in 2017, positive word of mouth would see the original Doki Doki Literature Club hit an amazing 13 million downloads. The now iconic release would receive high praise from critics and players for its intriguing nature, evolving story, memorable characters, and meta qualities, all of which facilitate an experience quite unlike that which might have been originally expected.

Pokémon Day is nearly here! The ancient celebration of Pokémon, established in 2016, is currently considered the most important holiday on every religious calendar.
As department stores start hanging their Pokémon Day decorations, all eyes are turned toward the Pokémon Company to see what will be announced. Will Pokémon Scarlet and Violet receive DLC? Will they become functioning video games? Will we get updates from some of the series' many sub-franchises, like Pokémon Mystery Dungeon or Pokkén Tournament? Nobody knows! But I know one game we probably won't see is Pokémon Sleep.
Oh, man, remember Pokémon Sleep?
Think back with me for just a moment on the halcyon days of 2019. In late May, the Pokémon Company held a press conference where…]]></summary>

Digimon World: Next Order has made the digi-jump over to Switch today. The game is an enhanced port of the PS4 version that launched in 2017 and includes a Beginner Mode and a Run feature. However, the Switch version is missing one feature that's included in the Steam version — dual audio.
The PC release of the game, and the original PS4 rerelease, allows you to swap between both English and Japanese voices in the menu. However, fans have reported online that the Switch version doesn't include the Japanese audio (via ResetEra).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still not loving that logo
This past September, we were sad to report that the massive Sega GiGO Building 4 arcade located in the Tokyo borough of Akihabara was closing after being a staple spot for 11 years. It seemed like an unfortunate victim of Japan’s shrinking arcade market. However, this past January, it was reported that the site would become a Bandai Namco Arcade in its place, set to open this March.
Thanks to Genki_JPN on Twitter, we now have a look at the building’s new facade.
https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1627337359166701569?s=20
While I was in Japan back in 2014, I paid a visit to the Sega GiGo location in Akihabara. However, I’d have difficulty accurately differentiating it from the other game centers I visited in the area. It was at the end of a two-week journey through the country, I was very tired, it was raining, and I was carrying around a backpack roughly the size and weight of a dairy cow. If I’m thinking of the right place, though, I played Kiki Kaikai, Typing of the Dead, F-Zero AX, and won an awesome chibi Naoto Shiragane figure in one attempt on one of the crane machines.
The fact that one arcade is being directly replaced with another is some comfort. The arcade industry has pretty much disappeared entirely in most areas (especially mine) in the past few decades here in North America. Going to Japan and being able to take a seat at a cabinet is a wonderful experience. However, it’s maybe worth noting that the Bandai Namco locations tend to lean heavier on crane machines. While those are fun, too, they’re not as satisfying as row upon row of new and classic games.
Still! The building is remaining an arcade, and that’s key. We’ll see Bandai Namco’s approach to the business when it opens in March 2023.

How to play Resident Evil Village in VR, and what the VR version actually entails
You can access the free DLC here or on the PS5 dashboard (where it's listed as "Resident Evil Village VR mode") and it requires a roughly 800MB download.

It's been back for over a year, in fact, via Zoom Platform, who've just made the interesting choice to publish it on Steam too, promising that their own store will remain resolutely DRM-free, and that this aims "to help fund additional signings and improvements for our DRM-Free preservation efforts". I'll brush aside analysing this strategy, because the immediate upshot is that, hopefully, Hardwar might finally get its due. In a better world, we'd already be playing its modern descendants.

However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.
In a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We'll just have to wait and see. 
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month. Be sure to click the banner below to find a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos dissecting the anticipated remake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.
Each sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Documentaries chronicling game development are great. With so much marketing fluff surrounding games, it can be nice to hear directly from the devs about their inspirations, struggles, and creative intentions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roguelike dungeon crawler Backpack Hero has been in early access for under a year, and it’s now getting a full 1.0 launch on PC and consoles in May. Backpack Hero has been successful for its three-person dev team and stood apart from other roguelikes with its Tetris-inspired inventory management. You see, success in Backpack Hero is determined by how you organise your bag rather than what you’re actually carrying, as you shuffle items around a grid to create synergies and mod your playstyle.

This is the reason that Pluto TV is free, since revenue is generated through advertising. Unofficial Pluto TV .m3u playlists are easy to access and do away with advertising and user behavior tracking mechanisms. A copyright complaint sent by the MPA this week pulls no punches; these playlists facilitate piracy on a massive scale.

The event begins at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern on Twitch and YouTube and will reveal five new PSVR2 titles. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like we should expect anything first-party related. The announcement tweet states that third-party titles and indies will get a bulk of the spotlight. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which launches in May, will also have an in-depth segment with extended footage.
State of Play is back! Tune in Thursday at 1pm PT for:

The event comes during a big week for Sony, as PlayStation VR2 launches on Wednesday, February 22 (check out our review of the headset here). We last saw Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at the Game Awards last December, where it was confirmed to launch on May 26 and will feature Kevin Conroy's final video game performance as Batman. Perhaps we'll get confirmation on the game's rumored live-service elements.]]></summary>

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.
Atomic Heart’s premise is one of its most intriguing elements. The game t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time is flying by a little too fast in 2023, although it’s not all bad news as a new month means new Game Pass additions. Microsoft have announced the next four games hitting the service before March 3rd, alongside Atomic Heart which releases today. I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.


Here are the next batch of Game Pass titles:

Merge & Blade (Feb 28th)
Soul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)
F1 22 (March 2nd)
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)

This is my first time hearing of Merge & Blade, not to be confused with Mount & Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge & Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pokémon Presents returns Monday, February 27, with 20 minutes of Pokémon news celebrating Pokémon Day 2023. 
The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday. 
The next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩
#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉
https://t.co/Xo6KYjvSdj pic.twitter.com/FFrmk8a5z8
February 21, 2023
With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

But if you're someone who hasn't got the time to do so, or you're a bit unsure whether Yakuza is for you, then there's another way in. Now pick up that bike and walk with me.

        <updated>2023-02-21T13:02:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft has signed a binding 10-year legal agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players, presuming the company's colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. 
Since the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.' Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. 
Now, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: 
We’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO
February 21, 2023
Many have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with "full feature and content parity." 
If I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review.

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

From the look of the screenshots, I was expecting a creepy story in the vein of Little Misfortune or Fran Bow, but instead Birth is infinitely more introspective. Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I've ever played.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart’s long development cycle has provided ample opportunities to show off the power of ray tracing. From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.
I noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that "the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch." Well then!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jumplight Odyssey is an upcoming starship roguelite colony sim from the makers of Armello, and when I saw it in action late last year, I was extremely pumped for it. It was formally announced with its very flash animated opening sequence during November's PC Gaming Show Preview stream, but now you, too, can see what it actually looks like in motion with its very first gameplay trailer. Come and have a gander at its spaceship antics - or, if you're like me, just watch the two full seconds of a crew member giving Ham the pig a nice big belly-rub on repeat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After being stranded on the original Playstation for two decades, the time-travelling sequel Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition finally made its way to PC last year. It should’ve been cause for celebration as the classic Square JRPG had never seen a European release, but technical woes plagued the modern port and dampened the party. Now a year after launch, Square is updating Radical Dreamers with a “wide range of changes” later this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. 


Oddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve played a lot of strange games, but never one that lurches between greatness and bafflement as hard or as fast as Atomic Heart. It’s a fascinatingly chaotic medley of ideas, and a rare FPS that lacks even the slightest whiff of battle pass-peddling live serfdom, but those ideas so often fail to gel that it can feel like a game made by several different dev teams. For a shooter set within an alternate history Soviet Union, it could perhaps have used some more central planning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see novelty games on Steam every couple of days; things like gun-wielding slime shooters, or hyper-realistic dog-walking sims. They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  


I Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. 


In fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. 


Lies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.


The newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?

Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate takes place in the city of Astrum Close where the crime rate is only 0.001%.

The game is currently available on the Meta Quest 2, is launching on PlayStation VR2 on February 22nd, and launches on Nintendo Switch later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional "summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of "just one more turn"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into "just one more game". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like wizards because they're the dramatic combination of powerful, cocky, and a bit dim. Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face. Splendid chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel's Midnight Suns, here.]]></summary>

Late last year, turn-based indie RPG The Outbound Ghost was delisted from Steam after a statement from lead dev Conrad Grindheim claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had “dissolved.” Soon after, Digerati filed a lawsuit against developer Conradical over a breach of contract and “several false defamatory” statements. When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout "yosh!" as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude's head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

Like a Dragon: Ishin is not a new game. It's a remake of an old game – 2014's Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, released only in Japan on the PS3 and PS4. And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku's (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan's Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker's streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, "The Final Countdown," which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton's character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game's creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the "greatest game ever made" made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31. 
Are you going to check Tetris out next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

I'd say building a romantic connection with a wrestler entirely formed of green ooze, or training your M.E.A.T. at Mrs. Muscles gym counts as magic – pure magic, even. And that's what Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid On The Block offers. It's a wrestling dating sim with a splash of RPG, and almost certainly a game that'll pin your heart in a bear hug and never let go.

But alas, here we are in 2023 with another Octopath Traveler game that is, bar a couple of very light tweaks and additions, exactly the same game as what came before it, for better and for worse.

In an age where remakes and retro-inspired projects try recreating what classic games of old felt like, Octopath Traveler II accomplishes something impressive. Despite being rooted in modern design with a host of conveniences, it effortlessly captures the spirit, style, and sense of adventure of the best RPGs from the SNES era, while still innovating and showing there’s life in turn-based battles yet. The feat is even more remarkable, considering Octopath II’s most significant changes are small and subtle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today we looked at the most affordable PCIe 4.0 SSD, with the Solidigm P41 Plus 2TB at $99.99, and now it's time to look at one of the very fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the WD SN850x. It's down to $99.99 for a 1TB model and $159.99 for a 2TB size, a new low price for each capacity and a great deal for our top PCIe 4.0 SSD recommendation. 
This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall 'fastest SSD' recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

That's a heavy reduction from its original $169.99 price point, and an awesome value for a drive that works well in PCs and even PS5s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. 
The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game's season pass. Firaxis' role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot diggedy daffodil, am I glad I picked Casual difficulty in Veil Of Dust. Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says "it's pretty tough - you've been warned". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the heady mists of 1994 once came Master Of Magic, an all-time best 4X loosely summarisable as Civilisation crossed with Master Of Orion.
In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I'd actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it's basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I've also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I've realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that's important to the team?

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again. But the otherworldly take on old-world Japan, filled with giant mythical beasts, is a profo…]]></summary>

Previously, you needed to own all three Total War: Warhammer games to play Immortal Empires, since it compiles campaign maps, war units, and Legendary Lords from across the strategy trilogy. Now, you’ll just need to own Warhammer 3 for access to the campaign.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.

The game itself proved enough of a satisfying monster hunter (no relation) to charm Liam, but the technical mess remained.
Developers Omega Force say they’re continuing to work on Wild Heart’s PC performance, including the future addition of DLSS and FSR upscaling, and this week released a patch that claimed to fix several key snags. Did it? To find out, I returned to it with the same RTX 3070 GPU I used for our original best settings guide, and... uh, it’s still bad. Sorry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never had much of a desire for "I'm attending school" sims, because I hated attending school and not having to do it is one of the prime benefits of growing out of your teens. Running a school though? That's a challenge I don't mind taking on. Twopoint Campus does a great plate-spinning take on a school admin sim, but if you want something with cards, a dark lord, and the option for organic school meals, then... well, then you're making a very specific request. But it's one I can fulfil with Spellcaster University. And it's bloody difficult.

Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

Through The Nightmares may not be about spellcasting and amateur alchemy, but it still draws upon the arcane and otherworldly, setting its deviously difficult action-platforming inside the sleepscapes of frightened children.
You are the Sandman, and you are neither sprinkling happy dust on Danish eyelids nor delivering Liberace-haired boyfriends to vocal quartets. Instead, you’re an active fighter of nightmares, diving into the brains of restless kids to explore their most traumatic memories and, ultimately, defeat the monstrous embodiments of their fears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-clad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.]]></summary>

The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it's coming out a week early.

Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…]]></summary>

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20230203/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-03T18:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
