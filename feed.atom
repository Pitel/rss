        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games firs - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. 
It's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).

Developer Meowza Games has announced that a new update for Mineko's Night Market has now gone live on Nintendo Switch, adding a swath of fixes that should make for a more pleasant experience for players.
If you remember in our review, we mentioned that the game suffered from a number of bugs that hampered our overall enjoyment of the title. One severe bug even stopped us from seeing the ending, and while it doesn't look like this is listed below, we're certain Meowza will get it sorted in due course.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is already out in some parts of the world now, and it's been received incredibly well by critics so far with a current score of 93 on aggregate websites like Metacritic.
In our own review, we said it was "the best 2D Mario game since Super Mario World" on the Super Nintendo. It serves up an endlessly inventive and impressive platforming adventuring that has us utterly hooked.

This makes Diablo 4 the first Timed Trial game that is part of Free Play Days, but honestly, it comes at a great time. Season 2 of Diablo 4 is a lot of fun and is a great opportunity for prospective players to have a fun Action RPG experience over the weekend. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a similar option is available for PC or PlayStation.




For those with Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'll also have access to NBA 2K24, Lawn Mowing Simulator, and Hokko Life during this Free Play Days event. As always, your progress across all of these titles, including the Diablo 4 trial, is saved. So, if you do end up deciding to purchase the game after the event, or even at a later date, you will be able to pick up where you left off.


Alongside the 10-hour trial, Diablo 4 is also on sale for 25% through November 1. Altogether this is a great chance to try out the game and if it tickles your fancy, you can purchase it at its lowest price yet. 10 hours is plenty of time to know if you are going to like what Diablo 4 has to offer.


Diablo 4 Season 2 is live now on all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive has announced the next Stellaris expansion, titled Astral Planes. The new narrative-focused expansion will allow players to wield reality-breaking technologies to explore alternate dimensions. In these parallel universes, players will encounter new creatures and phenomena as they journey into the true unknown. There was no specific release date given for Astral Planes, but the release does say it is coming to PC later this year.




The story-centric expansion will feature branching narratives, a first for Stellaris. Players can navigate a branching narrative built specifically to make choices matter. According to Paradox, Astral Planes will be full of surprises and hard choices. Decisions will not only affect the narrative but also shape the player's empire to fit their playstyle.


In terms of gameplay features, Astral Planes will feature new Technologies, Actions, and Relics, which is pretty par for the course for this type of expansion. It also appears there is a new Origin called Riftworld. 


Stellaris is my favorite Grand Strategy game, so any new content looks good to me. But depending on how the Astral Planes actually works, this could set the 4X title up for even more content avenues in the future.


Stellaris: Astral Planes will be released on PC later this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of DreadXP’s Indie Horror Showcase, Philisophic Games has pulled back the curtain on Hellpunk, a horror game about hitting things with things.


I’ve got a dearth of information here, but Hellpunk seems to be a game trying to nail the ever-elusive feeling of melee combat in a first-person game. It uses somewhat lo-fi graphics, and all the press material I have just says it’s about angrily killing foes. The foes consist of CRT-headed dudes and other assorted weirdos. Don’t worry about creating CRT-headed orphans, however, because apparently, you’re fighting “through the depths of the human mind.” The very angry depths.




To be fair, though, the short, 22-second trailer says a lot. Beyond the trippy visuals, first-person melee is a carrot that few have even touched. 2005’s Condemned: Criminal Origins is often cited as one of the few games to even come close to making it work. I’m currently straining to think of another game that did it well following that. Doom (2016)’s glory kills come to mind, but it’s just hitting a button and watching Doomguy be all vicious. That really doesn’t count.


So, yeah, that’s all I got, aside from the fact that it calls itself “Murder-punk.” We’ll have to wait and see if Hellpunk manages to achieve what has been lost.


Hellpunk is coming to PC via Steam. Its page is available to wishlist, but there is no target release window.

        <updated>2023-10-19T18:29:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightdive Studios has shown off their upcoming remaster, System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, at the indie horror showcase. This updated version transplants the 1999 classic to the KEX Engine, bringing with it all the modern comforts that the engine offers.


Nightdive has really been moving on these remasters. Star Wars: Dark Forces was just recently announced along with Turok 3, while SiN Reloaded got shunted a bit to the side to make room. System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition has been in the pipeline for a while, however, with it being promised to anyone who pre-ordered the System Shock remaster.




The Enhanced Edition comes with the added benefit of higher resolution, widescreen, and post-processing effects. The graphics have also been touched up, but in typical Nightdive fashion, they’re carefully tweaked to improve the look without altering the gameplay. It will also be available on consoles for the first time.


System Shock 2 was the first game from Irrational Games and was a sequel to Looking Glass Studios’ 1994 title, System Shock. The title is held in high regard, and its design would influence its spiritual successor, 2007’s Bioshock. I’m sure some fans will be disappointed that Nightdive didn’t completely overhaul the 1999 title in the same way they did the original System Shock, but of the two titles, the latter definitely needed a lick of paint.


There’s still no release date for System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition aside from “coming soon” and “in the near future.” It will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Mario Bros. Wonder is finally here, and you can celebrate in physical merch form with this new My Nintendo reward. Nintendo now has a listing for the "Super Mario Bros. Wonder Double Keychain," which features Mario in his normal and elephant forms (hence the "double"). It's a little strange having Mario and his presumed doppelganger on there instead of another character, but what are you gonna do: he sells merch!


Mario rewards typically go fast, but at 800 Platinum Points, you'll want to sit and think on this one for a while. Here's a bit more info on the 5"x 6" reward to help you decide: "It also comes with a colorful strap that shows off the new Elephant Fruit, Drill Mushroom, Wonder Flower and Wonder Seed."


What other recent My Nintendo rewards are there?


If you have the sinking feeling that there was a recently announced but yet-to-be-released My Nintendo reward: there is! It's none other than the Detective Pikachu coffee cozy, representing a game that kind of came and went from our collective consciousness. We'll update you when it launches!


As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netmarble, the South Korean company behind Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross and Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds has announced a new update for Tower of God: New World, including new characters, story content, and more. The update also includes various limited time events lasting until November 1.




Urek Mazino (SSR+ [Flight]) and Endorsi (SSR [Child]) join the game in this Halloween update. In fact, the new story content, dubbed “Endorsi and the October Illusion,” is an original event dealing with Endorsi being bullied by her sisters. There’s also an event mission and illusion event exchange shop for October, where players can earn a new outfit for SSR Xia Xia. 


In addition, alternative costumes for Yuri, Rachel, and Lozeal are also available.


It’d seem the only event that’s not set to expire at the end of the month is a welcome back boost where players can earn a variety of rewards simply by playing the game and completing missions every day for seven days in a row. This event is currently ongoing with no projected end date.


Tower of God: New World released for Android and iOS devices (with a PC version available via Google Play Games Beta) this July. The mobile game follows the story of the acclaimed webtoon and anime adaptation, the latter of which premiered in 2020, as part of the Crunchyroll Originals branding. It’d seem a second season has been announced, but as of writing, no release date has been announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man didn't include the option to replay the story in New Game Plus mode when it first launched in 2018. But Insomniac wasn't lazing about in a hammock made of webbing, either. The developer launched the feature roughly six weeks after launch. Is it coming to the sequel? Oh yes, and now we (roughly) know when: before the end of this year.


New Game Plus (NG+) won't be alone on missing release, as Spider-Man 2 is also getting updated with a mission replay feature too. This update flew a bit under our radar, but like any wily city pigeon, we eventually caught it. Within the replies to Insomniac's announcement of a game up on Twitter/X, the company's community director was hashing out what's coming to Spider-Man 2 post-launch. The director in question, James Stevenson, mentioned New Game Plus mode will release for Spider-Man 2 "before [the] end of [the] year." 





Will New Game Plus and mission replay release for Spider-Man 2 at the same time?


The bonus to the news is that the NG+ mode isn't coming to the game alone. Spider-Man 2 will get a mission replay feature, according to Stevenson. It's not confirmed that it'll arrive alongside New Game Plus, however. In a reply, Stevenson wrote that the team is "working on an update for those features," including NG+, "but they won't be in Day 1." He later clarifies when NG+ is expected to drop, but isn't specific about mission replay.





Either way, it should be exciting for Spider-Man 2 fans who dream of knocking out early-game bosses while fully kitted out. The NG+ update for the original game included two more trophies: 'One More Time' got awarded for playing the game again in NG+, and 'Power and Responsibility' was earned after beating the game in Ultimate difficulty. And yes, you could acquire the latter trophy in NG+.


Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launches on PlayStation 5 on October 20.

It’s not my usual habit, but when I find a sim, a survival game, an MMO, or something of that nature, and it just clicks, that’s usually my go-to for a while.


I find there’s a lot of that pull in most games even tangentially related, whether it’s the building mechanics in Valheim or the budgeting of another Theme Park sim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Punch Man is great and often hilarious manga/anime about Saitama, the namesake of the franchise, who defeats every foe he encounters with one punch. It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.
One Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Train of thought.
When a mystery story has been told millions of times before, how can it still be a mystery? This is the challenge faced by anyone adapting Agatha Christie’s phenomenally widely-read 1934 novel, Murder on the Orient Express. And just in case anyone missed out on the book, decades of film adaptations have also solved the case again and again. This is the challenge taken on by Microids Studio Lyon, as the team packs our bags and stows us away on the legendary locomotive, playing the role of celebrated detective Hercule Poirot.
Murder on the Orient Express, like the novel, begins in Istanbul, in the grand Tokatlian Hotel. Several of the story’s ensemble cast are introduced in quick succession. Details are kept light and the player is tested on a few key facts about each character to reinforce the basics of who’s who. Since the complex relationships and interactions of figures from different backgrounds are a hallmark of Christie’s mysteries, it’s essential the characters are internalised. Microids, having opted for rote drilling of name, nationality, occupation, and age, have not found the most elegant solution, but it will at least be effective for newcomers while keeping things moving for those already familiar. The game trades the 1930s setting of the novel for the modern day, and with 2023 being the 140th anniversary of the Orient Express itself, there is a perfect excuse for Poirot and his crew of soon-to-be suspects to be stepping aboard.

The most exciting feature of the update is the new Overlord Ghost. What’s exciting about that (besides the obvious)? Well, one of the skins you can unlock for it is none other than Samhain. If you aren’t hip to my jive, Samhain is one of the most beloved villains of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon. He was featured in one of the best episodes of the first season and then appeared multiple times throughout the rest of the show’s run. Despite being shown in the intro of Extreme Ghostbusters, he never actually appeared in the show proper, unfortunately.

The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.


Amongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in "revenge" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they've made the continue button "sexier". Look, don't ask me, I just work here.

        <updated>2023-10-19T16:09:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As discovered by Liliputing and picked up by The Verge, a handheld PC company is toying with a rather familiar-looking screen configuration for one of their upcoming products: the Ayaneo Flip DS and its sibling, the Ayaneo Flip KB. The KB just flips open to a mini-keyboard, while the DS has an upper and lower screen, similar to a particularly well-known line of Nintendo handhelds.


The handheld PCs are both powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 7840U CPU and Radeon 780M integrated graphics. They have a primary display size of 7 inches and a refresh rate of 120hz. That’s all that has really been “leaked” by Ayaneo, and I emphasize those quotes because Liliputing does.


Call me short of imagination, but I have no idea what else you’d use the second screen for. To show a slideshow of your anime waifus while you play Doom (2016)? I’m fairly certain that it’s intended for the crowd looking to emulate Nintendo DS games, which I find funny because I think the best platform to emulate Nintendo DS games is a Nintendo DS. It has the form factor and screen resolution and everything. They’re also super cheap. They just don’t let you play modern PC games, so I guess if you’re short on pocket space…


However, I feel like pointing out that it won’t be a very good DS surrogate unless that second screen is a touch display. Try playing Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland without one. I feel like, given its obvious purpose, it has to be, but that hasn't been confirmed. 


Meanwhile, The Verge reporter Sean Hollister sounds practically exasperated with Ayaneo’s hijinks. They say: “The company also announces new designs faster than it can ship them — by the time I’ve received one of the company’s products for testing, it’s almost always already moved on to a newer, more desirable model.”


The isn’t for me, but it might be for you. I, on the other hand, have a sudden desire to play Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland again.

It's less about mere familiarity than you'd think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's "send a colony ship into space" ending could have asked "what if lasers and aliens", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?

        <updated>2023-10-19T15:53:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poncle has unveiled the latest update for the seminal auto-aggro game Vampire Survivors for the holiday season. It’s the Whiteout update, also known as update 1.7.0, a festive little addition that will get you into the holiday spirit if you haven’t accepted it into your heart already.


The Whiteout update is absolutely free (Merry Crimbo) and available now. It comes with all the holiday fixings:



6 new EXTRA achievements


1 new bonus stage


2 new relics to get a new PowerUp and morph an existing character


1 new weapon with its evolution


1 new playable character


1 new music track





Thanks, Santa! Meanwhile, there’s a tongue-in-cheek trailer to watch that will remind you that big department stores have been celebrating the Birth of Christ since July. “If big named stores can do it, why can’t we??” shouts the trailer—damned right.


As a reminder, I was the one who performed the sacrifice and conjured a review for Vampire Survivors after its Switch release. As a warning, it’s designed by a former gambling guy to be as addictive as possible. On the other hand, it’s innocuous in the way that there is a general endpoint to the game, and it won’t keep asking for your money. Aside from a couple of DLC packs, there are no microtransactions. The only thing you’re risking is a relentless impulse to chase a rush of endorphins. But let’s be honest, social media has probably already conditioned you that way.


Happy Holidays!


Vampire Survivors is available PC, console, and mobile. The Whiteout update (1.7.0) is available now. No, wait, consoles are "soon." PC is now!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space Tales is a new real-time strategy game from Vietnam-based Saigon Dragon, who worked with Numantian Games to develop the brilliant They Are Billions. In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.

You can also roll the dice on the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 on the Switch on October 24, if you're the gambling type. Maybe it'll be playable, maybe not! Gargoyles Remastered is out too (we have a review for it!) as is Jackbox Party Pack 10 and Mail Time. Oh, and all the aforementioned stuff below.

For many gamers, Dragonforce is probably most well-known for the absurdly difficult 'Through the Fire and the Flames' song on 2007's Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. The band, however, also happens to be pretty darn good in its own right, even if its music isn't quite to everybody's taste.
Ahead of the launch of the band's new album Warp Speed Warriors on March 15th, 2024, Dragonforce has released 'Power of the Triforce', a new single based on none other than The Legend of Zelda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of news I never expected I would be writing, not only is there a game adaptation of a severely niche anime, but its title is — unsurprisingly, for an anime — very, very long.


My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom -Pirates of the Disturbance- is scheduled to release on November 28, and publisher Idea Factory International has announced the game’s limited edition, which features a slew of bonus goodies. 


Included in the limited edition is a steel game case, an official hardcover art book, an audio drama and official soundtrack, a reversible cover sleeve, a collector’s box, and an exclusive trading card. The audio dramas are available with Japanese audio, but there will be a link to an English translation PDF that fans can refer to. In addition, the soundtrack will feature 19 tracks found across the game’s world. Interested players can pre-order the limited edition on October 25 at 10 a.m. PDT / 12 p.m. CST / 1 p.m. EST. 




My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom -Pirates of the Disturbance- continues the story as told in the anime and follows Catarina Claes, reincarnated in the world of an otome game called Fortune Lover as the game’s doomed villainess. 


In this next chapter, Catarina and her brother Keith are set to board a luxury liner called the Vinculum when it’s attacked by pirates. It’s then she remembers these incredibly familiar events sound oddly like a fanbook for Fortune Lover. 


This expansion to the anime series is set for release on November 28 exclusively for the Nintendo Switch.

Each year, the holiday adds some new goodies for Guardians to hunt, all while collecting Candy, uncovering spooky lore, and taking on redecorated Haunted Lost Sectors. This year, Bungie is adding another twist, with the opportunity to focus Exotic armor using Festival currencies. 


Better yet, purchasing these Engrams does not require that players have already earned the Exotic they want, given the feature's roulette-like nature. So, the Festival of the Lost can serve as a tremendous catch-up opportunity for those in need. But before players dive into the game to earn that last lingering Exotic or fish for a wanted roll, players ought to know what goes into this new option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speedrunning events like Games Done Quick are a chance for people to break world records, while also raising money for charity. It was announced recently that Awesome Games Done Quick will be an in-person event. On top of that, the event will also see its first non-human combatant.


That's right, according to speedrunner and streamer JSR_, AGDQ 2024 represents the first time a dog will officially participate in speedrunning on this level. A trailer video shows that Peanut Butter, the Shiba Inu owned by JSR_, will be there to see if they can break their personal best.




What game will they be playing? According to a post on Twitter, Peanut Butter (sometimes referred to as PB) will be running the 1985 NES game Gyromite.


Not their first rodeo


While JSR_ will be assisting PB to some extent, game inputs will be conducted solely by the dog. A video from earlier this year shows they've done this before, making it through the game in 25:29. The basic set-up utilizes a series of colored buttons hooked up to the game, which Peanut Butter activates (for treats, of course).


Interestingly, both JSR_ and PB are up on Speedrun.com under their own category: Game B - Dog Assistance. The schedule on the AGDQ website shows that this will be an online run rather than in-person, with an expected time of 30 minutes.


We can already see that Peanut Butter seems to have got down the specifics of Gyromite. Yes, I'm aware that they probably don't fully understand what's happening, but who among us isn't the least bit tempted to watch a dog play video games? AGDQ will be going ahead in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the run-up to the end of October, many horror studios are getting some content ready for this most spookiest of seasons. One such example comes from Amnesia: The Bunker developer Frictional Games, and a new video outlines the custom settings coming in a soon-to-be-released update.


Over on the Frictional YouTube channel, creative lead Fredrik Olsson showcases the new "Custom Settings" mode that's coming to the latest Amnesia game.




As you'll see in the footage, there are a series of parameters that can be played with so you can set the game's difficulty however you want. For example: you can set it so that every time you save, fuel is used up. You can even disable saving all together. Or maybe you want to make things easier by extending how long the torch stays lit or the amount of resources there are.


More to come in this WW1 nightmare


This is all going to be part of the new update which, according to the video, is expected to roll out soon. However, given that it's being referred to as the "Halloween update," we can already take a guess at roughly when it'll be available.


Along with custom settings, the Amnesia: The Bunker patch will also come with the option to hone your skills in the Training Grounds. This will allow you to have a little practice at firing your gun or throwing grenades, right before you dive on into the horror of the titular bunker.


There's also the new 'shell shocked' difficulty, which aims to make the game even harder. Because when you're hiding in the dark from a terrifying monster, what most of us are thinking is, "hmm, I wish this was somehow more stressful."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you even keep just a tiny watch on the video game world, you won't be shocked to learn that Starfield has been quite the big deal. As of September, Bethesda's epic sci-fi RPG was the top ranking game in the US in terms of sales.


That's according to a chart uploaded by Circana analyst Mat Piscatella on Twitter. The image gives a rundown of the twenty best-selling games in the US market between the end of August and September 30. Starfield sits comfortably at the top, while new entries such as Mortal Kombat 1 and EA Sports FC 24 are at the number two and number three positions, respectfully.




The figures include both physical and digital copies of the games across all major platforms. As an aside, it's interesting to see Resident Evil 4 jump up from 27th to 12th place, but that's almost certainly because of the recent Separate Ways DLC.


And for those trying to spot Baldur's Gate 3 on the list, Piscatella clarified that digital sales of the RPG aren't reflected in the list, as "Larian Studios is not a panel member."


It won't last forever, though


Of course, no one's surprised to see Starfield at the top. The game was hyped up for quite some time and with no sign of The Elder Scrolls 6, this was all Bethesda fans had to look forward to.


However, things have definitely gone a bit quiet for the game. In fact, if you take a look at the Top Sellers list on Steam, you can see that – at the time of writing – Starfield is now at number 35, having taken quite a drop recently. It's even below the Special Edition of Skyrim, which goes to show how much staying power TES5 has.


These trends are to be expected, though. As much as Todd Howard and his team would love people to be playing Starfield for many years to come, we can expect to see interest wane as time goes on. That's just the way it is for most releases.

Since then, Steam Deck users have been complaining about THPS's befuddling always-online requirement, which meant that any connection issues—which can be common on the go—would terminate the game outright. Just over a week later, out of the blue, Activision's Vicarious Visions and Iron Galaxy pushed out a small patch dedicated specifically to Deck users.


Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2's patch 1.1 mentions just two Deck-specific tweaks that are very welcome indeed:

Publisher GameMill Entertainment has announced that The Walking Dead: Destinies will launch digitally on the Nintendo Switch eShop on November 17th, 2023, with a physical edition following in December 2023. A brand new trailer has been released which you can now view on YouTube, but just be aware that it's age-restricted, so make sure you're signed in (and over 18, of course).
Based on the first four seasons of the AMC TV series, Destinies will take place across iconic locations from the Walking Dead universe, including Atlanta, the Greene family farm, the prison, and Woodbury. Players will need to make key decisions throughout the game to change the course of the franchise's history. Will you sentence protagonist Rick Grimes to an early death? It's entirely up to you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After busting down the castle door with their chaotic, siege-based citybuilder Diplomacy Is Not An Option last year, the last thing I expected to see next from developers Door 407 was a chill, meditative puzzle game that's just about, well, building tiny cities. In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.
This being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is almost here – just one more day until it hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20. We loved it – read Game Informer's review of it here – and are excited for everyone to get their hands on it. Yesterday, we learned Insomniac Games recommends players download the day one patch for the "best experience" before starting the first mission, and now, we've learned when to expect the fan-favorite New Game Plus feature in the sequel. 
As first reported by PlayStation Lifestyle, someone asked Insomniac Games community director James Stevenson if New Game Plus and mission replay will be in the game at launch. Stevenson said, "No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1."
No - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1
October 17, 2023
After someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. 
Someone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it "should be before end of year."
Should be before end of year
October 18, 2023
So if you're looking forward to replaying the story of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with all of your favorite suits, gadgets, abilities, and more unlocked from the jump, it sounds like it could be just a month or two away. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Day 1 patch. After that, check out Game Informer's spoiler-free tips to know before starting Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We are defenders of the night! We are Gargoyles!".
Back in the mid-to-late '90s, Disney produced a cartoon called Gargoyles that stood out quite a bit from other shows in the animated landscape. Featuring a serialized storytelling format, rich lore, and a rather dark tone, it quickly gained a cult following across its run, though it never garnered a large enough fanbase that would allow it to blossom into a massive franchise for the House of Mouse.
At the height of the show’s popularity, a video game adaptation was produced for the Sega Genesis in the twilight of the fourth generation of game consoles, though it was met with middling reviews and sales. Now that Gargoyles is looking to make a comeback with the recently announced Disney+ show on the way, Disney has seen fit to give this game a re-release as Gargoyles Remastered from Empty Clip Studios. Featuring some new additions like a rewind feature and updated art and music, this revival of a half-forgotten cult classic is an okay outing, but much like other 16-bit Disney titles, it hasn’t aged all that well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gargoyles was a show that interested me as a kid, but I rarely got to sit down and watch. It was another “darker” Saturday morning cartoon that came about in the wake of Batman: The Animated Series’ success. In fact, the first season was penned by writers from that series. It was the thing at the time. What I remember liking best about Gargoyles was the comfortable feeling of danger and tension that was unique to this particular brand of cartoon.


I’m actually more familiar with the 1995 Sega Genesis game based on the property, which, as it turns out, isn’t entirely faithful. It’s also not very good. It’s okay at best. So, it’s interesting to see Disney revisit the title, though it’s likely got a lot to do with the planned Disney+ live-action adaptation. But does a remaster fix all the is…]]></summary>

It's kinda like the roguelikelike slot machine Luck Be A Landlord dressed for a Halloween party in a turn-based tactics costume. Million Monster Militia is ropey in its current early access stage, but I have enjoyed discovering weird builds and I am cautiously curious about its future after some updates.

We are mere hours away from the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on 20th October (that's tomorrow!) and it is fair to say that Nintendo has been stepping up the marketing into 'home-straight' territory. We're getting exclusive interviews, comedy short ads, even bus-spotting competitions, but what we haven't seen all that much, is merchandise of the cuddly variety.
Fortunately, it seems that Japanese toy manufacturer, San-ei Boeki, has us covered as an Elephant Mario plushie has just been revealed for a release in January 2024. The plushie was revealed in a tweet from @sanei_NLG, showing that it stands at 26cm tall and has all of the detail that you would expect from the company (remember, this is the team behind a lot of the Pokémon plushies that you can find on the Pokémon Centre online store, so we know that we are in safe hands here).

Yesterday’s 1.1 patch for the Steam version has now made offline play possible, but in a move that simultaneously makes loads of and absolutely no sense, it’s only available on the Steam Deck.

After all, the flipside of the genre mantra of solving problems through imaginative application of the tools is that when you achieve a boring solution, that's all your fault. Did you miss the final jump while trying for a complex, third-storey infiltration in Deathloop, resulting in a sadly non-immersive firefight in the courtyard below? Did you fail to combo those magical abilities and terrain variables as the developers hoped - nay, dreamed you would, forcing you to rely on ye olde cover-shoot tactics to reach the checkpoint? Shame on you! Don't you know how much imsims cost to develop? Go back to Open-Ended Systems School and retake that course in The Power of Choice. Also, consider playing Mosa Lina instead.

Tech company Ayaneo is pumping out more hardware iterations than we can possibly keep up with, but its latest effort is of particular interest thanks to its remarkable resemblance to Nintendo's own DS line.
Yes, the Ayaneo Flip DS is on its way (thanks, The Verge) and boasts a 7-inch 120Hz display screen with an additional screen housed in that classic clamshell design popularised by the Nintendo DS. A second iteration has also been announced called the Ayaneo Flip KB, only this one sports a rather finicky keyboard in place of the second screen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation VR2 isn't natively compatible with PCs, which is a disappointment to some players. Since the headset launched, modders have been attempting to change this, and it appears that a significant breakthrough has been made. 




Mediator Software revealed that it has gotten the PS VR2 to work in SteamVR. Currently, it only works under a narrow set of conditions. It is AMD-only and it requires DP-AUX emulator hardware. You'll also require a VirtualLink port on the GPU or the BizLink VirtualLink adapter.


The modders have experience with VR, as they're the creators of iVRy Driver, an app that lets you use your iPhone, Android, GearVR, Oculus Mobile, or Sony PSVR headset as a Virtual Reality Headset for your PC. They have revealed that they have had a tough time with the PS VR2, describing it as the "first consumer VR headset that needed a hardware 'hack' to make it work on a PC."


This isn't the only project Mediator Software is busy with. It is also attempting the ambitious task of getting streaming headsets to work on the PS5. There are other modders also attempting to expand the capabilities of the PS VR2, including Rad, a team that managed to enable the sideloading of 3D videos on the PS VR.

Takashi Tezuka, a producer on Wonder, asked the game's programming director, Shiro Mouri, about the concept during the game's development. From there, the team "actually spent about six months seriously developing live commentary," according to Nintendo's Koichi Hayashida, in hopes of adding voices that matched the player's actions.


During development, a generic "newscaster" voice and a "Tsundere" option were entertained. A Japanese adjective, Tsundere is usually attributed towards a person or personality that's cold and harsh with glimpses of affection. Popular …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s almost time to swing back to the streets of New York City in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. But, before we do, developer Insomniac Games is encouraging players to download the day one patch.




In an image post made via Twitter, the developer confirms the entire game is present on the disc for physical players, and is fully playable without the need of a patch. But, “for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day — prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time.”


The studio went on to explain the day one patch — which serves to add “polish to the gold master version” of the game’s physical edition — will be auto-loaded for any digital players who pre-load the game. In addition to polish, the day one patch “improves the opening sections of the game” and adds accessibility options, according to Insomniac.


Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is set to continue where its predecessors left off, allowing players to explore an expanded NYC as they fight both new and existing villains such as Venom, Kraven the Hunter, and Lizard. It looks pretty good, judging by our own review from Chris Carter where it received a 9. It is set for release on October 20 exclusively for the PlayStation 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 7th Guest is a 1993 puzzle adventure game that was released on PCs in 1993, just a few months before Myst. It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.
For a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game "inspiring".

That's still a lot, but this is quite a fair price for a 1kW PSU from a well-known manufacturer, let alone an SFX-L one as these are often more expensive due to their level of miniaturisation that is required. This basically allows you to use even the most energy-intensive CPUs or GPUs available*.

        <updated>2023-10-18T19:39:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt RED is following through on its promise to stop official support for Gwent this year, but not before releasing one last update. The company announced on Gwent's website that a final update is coming, but the card game's future isn't ending.


Alongside the balance update is the inclusion of "Gwentfinity," which hands balance to the player base. The feature's announcement came last year alongside Gwent's sunsetting, so it's something fans have expected. 




Not all of Gwent will be in players' hands, as CD Projekt Red is employing a skeleton team to manage its infrastructure. This will ensure the game remains operational while keeping players generally in control.


How balance changes will work going forward is with the community-run Balance Council. Becoming a member involves being at Prestige 1 and Pro Rank for the season or winning 25 games in the season. These restrictions are to ensure eligible voters are community members deeply familiar with Gwent's meta.


Balance Council members will get to participate in monthly votes that potentially change a set number of cards. Restrictions include voting for up to three cards within certain brackets to ensure changes without breaking the game.


Beyond the newfound community control and some oversight from CD Projekt Red, Gwent will no longer see any new cards. This means any changes will be made with cards already implemented within the game.


Gwent's last update comes not too long after CD Projekt Red announced it is laying off around nine percent of its staff. Hopefully, all affected can find new workplaces and any remaining staff can effectively manage Gwent's community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom has released the second big update for their robot-powered dinosaur murder game, Exoprimal. Among the added features are the anticipated Street Fighter crossover skins.


Do you remember Exoprimal? It’s the game that everyone thought might be a new Dino Crisis when it was first announced, but then it turned out to be a live service multiplayer title. It’s actually pretty good! But pretty good is sort of a bad place to be in the live service market where most of the pie is being greedily gobbled up by a few of the most popular games. It’s an extremely over-the-top game about killing interdimensional robots that come pouring out of portals while also trying to beat another team at being the best dino killers.

The update includes some great stuff alongside the Street Fighter skins. There’s a new map called Ocean Platform that takes place on a platform out in an ocean. Also added is a new Final Mission alongside it called Escape. There are two new rigs, Edge Strike and Drone. Two new modules are getting thrown into the mix. Finally, there are a bunch of new rewards, balance changes, and bug fixes. You can check them out over here.


I’m curious to know what the player population is like with Exoprimal. Did it find its audience? Let’s see. The average player count for the last 30 days on Steam is 89.9. Eesh. At least there’s crossplay.


Exoprimal is available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Update 2 goes live today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asus make some of the best gaming laptops going, and their Flow Z13 (discounted today!) is one of the most interesting too. It's an ultraportable 13-inch machine with high-end specs, a 1200p (1920x1200) 120Hz touchscreen and a detchable keyboard. Plug in Asus' discrete GPU (or any other eGPU solution), and you're left with an extremely powerful gaming machine - then unplug and you've got a thin and light laptop for getting work done or consuming media on the go. Nice. 
Anyway, this laptop retailed for $1300 when it first debuted last year, but now it's down to $700 at Woot in the US. That's a substantial savings and a good deal for a 13-inch laptop with a Core i5 12500H CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take up the tactical task next month.
We are a little under a month away from the release of Persona 5 Tactica on Switch and publisher/developer Atlus has today revealed a handful of features that we can expect to see when we finally get our hands on the tactics title on 17th November.
Chief among today's additions is the reveal of the game's replay features. It seems that this is a game which invites replayability, with previously cleared stages being made up for grabs with new challenges so you can continue to level up your Personas. We also have today heard of the game's New Game+ option, which carries your completed data over to a new file so you can try to complete the Persona Compendium or try out the challenges with different difficulty modifiers.

From Resident Evil 4 to Death Stranding, the newest phones and tablets will support more graphically intense games.


Yet this isn't the tech giant's first massive push into gaming. Apple Arcade has been around for several years and is home to mostly casual titles. At $5 a month, it's not a bad deal to download some time-killers when nothing else is around. Some are genuinely solid games, and the service has only improved its offerings since its 2014 debut. 


As an iPhone and iPad user, I've used the service on and off, but now and again, something always draws me back in. Some of those deserve a spotlight — t…]]></summary>

Content warning: The following preview article features an overabundance of bread-based wordplay — those who suffer from chronic pun intolerance should proceed with extreme caution. Nintendo Life takes no responsibility for 'cringuries' or loss of humour.

The appetite for a 'true' return of Paper Mario has long been on the lips of many who grew up with the N64 and the GameCube. Despite the series' attempts to reinvent itself multiple times, fans have come to relish the taste of the original duo , a pair of turn-based RPGs that were the best thing since sliced bread. But in place of a new 'proper' paper game, many indie developers have risen to the challenge to create their own paper-thin homage to the beloved series.

It did so for several reasons – its beautifully realized visuals, top-notch voice acting, and, of course, the potential to play as some of my favorite characters in a Metroidvania-esque adventure. That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. 
It was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney. What's more, it replicated not just the broader stroke that anyone can hear and go, "Oh, that sounds like Disney music," but instead created something wholly original that simultaneously sounded…]]></summary>

Get ready to put your detective hats on, folks, because there's a mystery afoot. The Nintendo Switch reveal trailer — you know, the one where groups of trendy people play the up-and-coming console at such memorable and realistic venues as a rooftop party or at a basketball court — has been removed from the official Nintendo YouTube channel.
This was first brought to our attention by Reddit user CarbVan on r/GamingLeaksAndRumours and sure enough, looking at the YouTube channel in question, the reveal trailer is nowhere to be found. Of course, the video remains available online through outer outlets (the one posted by GameSpot, for example), so you can still find inspiration for which wacky and wonderful location you will play your Switch in next, but the question still stands: why has it been removed from its initial source?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RedDeer.Games has announced they’re handling the console publishing of MGP Studios and Solid9 Studios’ Project Downfall, a neon-drenched first-person shooter with shades of Hotline Miami. It’s coming to Switch in November, followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime later. Sorry, PlayStation fans.


Project Downfall is a psychedelic shooter that leans heavily on Hotline Miami while transplanting its gameplay to a first-person perspective. It’s heavily about slow-motion takedowns of groups of enemies, swapping weapons frequently, and throwing the ones you’re finished using to buy yourself some time. Your character is a wealthy businessman with a chip on their shoulder and a thirst for blood. There’s actually a plot buried beneath all the action involving global politics, but I’m fairly certain the protagonist cares little about that and just wants to perforate thugs.




I played Project Downfall this past January but only got through about an hour-and-a-half with it. I remember parting with it on bad terms, but for the life of me, I can’t remember why. I recall being a bit perturbed by how similar the narrative was to Hotline Miami, but I think I had an issue with the gameplay, as well. I just don’t remember what specifically.


If you do manage to make it through, there are 12 different endings for you to get depending on the choices you make throughout the game. Weirdly, the one new feature they tout for the console version is “a completely redesigned lighting system for Nintendo Switch.” Woo!


Project Downfall is currently available for PC. The Switch version will be released in November followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime after that.

And after just six weeks on the market, Starfield is already the seventh best-selling game of the year. February's Hogwarts Legacy remains in the top spot. 
Starfield hit Xbox and PC on September 6 and while its Xbox Game Pass release surely helped it become the biggest launch ever for a Bethesda game with more than 6 million players, Circana's data tracks dollar sales. This means Starfield was the best-selling game of September despite Xbox Game Pass. Circana executive director Mat Piscatella says on Twitter that, "Starfield ranked as the best-s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Blizzard Entertainment has revealed its first-ever musical collaboration for its free-to-play hero shooter, Overwatch 2, and it's with K-Pop group, Le Sserafim. The two parties have worked together for an upcoming music video for the K-Pop group as well as in-game Overwatch 2 content. 
Le Sserafim is comprised of five performers: Kim Chaewon, Sakura, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae. The group and Blizzard are working together for a video for Le Sserafim's next single, "Perfect Night," and it will debut on October 26 at 9 p.m. PT. The collaboration also includes a Le Sserafim-inspired custom game mode for Overwatch 2 and exclusive in-game items like hero skins. More details about the in-game events will arrive on October 30, according to Blizzard, but the content goes live for players on November 1. 
"We're extremely excited to be working with Le Sserafim for our game's first musical artist collaboration," Overwatch general manager Walter Kong writes in a press release. "Like the heroes of Overwatch, the Le Sserafim members are amazing as individuals, but unstoppable when they come together." 
Blizzard says Le Sserafim will also make an appearance at this year's BlizzCon on November 4 to perform "Perfect Night," as well as other songs, in the BlizzCon Arena following the conclusion of Community Night. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review and then read about the company's celebration of Overwatch 2's first anniversary.

So, imagine my surprise when it turns out that someone has managed to take the aforementioned titles and package them under one roof. Kind of.


If you've always wanted to know what Doom 2 would be like with Half-Life's sound effects, then ModDB user DASniperIC (thanks, PCGamesN) has just the thing for you.




If you want an idea of what it sounds like when the enemies of one game cry out like injured scientists in the other, the footage gives you a taste. Not only does the mod replace the enemy howls and roars with things like Black Mesa scientists, but all the weapons now sound like they come from Valve's IP, too.


Imps as headcrab zombies...what a world!


As DASniperIC says, it's entirely possible someone else has tackled the concept already. However, this version is simply their take on a Doom/Half-Life crossover.


It's one of a gazillion ways that these legendary shooters continue to get the modding treatment and thus remain in the gaming limelight. Classic Doom is certainly no stranger to mods, having spent the better part of three decades receiving tweaks and custom options from its community. 


As for Half-Life, well, that's still getting a lot of love these days, even more so the sequel. In any case, modding legendary FPS games shows no signs of slowing down. Maybe someone will combine Doom with another game from a bygone era, like Blood. Oh, wait. That's totally a thing.

It feels like I’ve been following this game for a very long time. It was originally called Alaskan Truck Simulator and was sponsored by the Discovery Channel, but that was eventually dropped. I’m just speculating, but it’s probably because it would be confused with Euro Truck Simulator 2.


According to the developer, Road Studio, they started as a small team but knew they needed more people to reach their vision. So they hired some veteran developers and quickly realized that they’d need to completely rebuild their code from the ground up.


As for my excitement about the game, the team has stated that their goal for it is to have you…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's rare that a developer explicitly introduces their game to you as "boring", and Indika seems anything but. Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a "very serious adventure game" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious "holy elder" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.
The game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a "fairy tale" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being as much of an insufferable, online-but-ultimately-in-quite-a-basic-way person as I am, I'm a Junji Ito girlie. The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status ("This is my hole! It was made for me!"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go "Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito."
This isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.

Wonder over the last couple of weeks (in addition to the hands-on I had as a part of our current cover story), and the review embargo has officially lifted. However, due to restrictive embargo guidelines that don't allow us to discuss large portions of the game, we have opted to hold our final review until the game is available for purchase. With that said, I did want to share some brief thoughts within the confines of the embargo.
I've loved my time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The game is aptly named for a title that instills a strong sense of wonder around every corner. Each stage introduces new gimmicks with appropriate and well-designed on-ramps, then expands on them in fun and unique ways. I truly never knew what I was getting into each …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two years after its initial reveal trailer, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is almost here. Due out October 20 exclusively on PlayStation 5, developer Insomniac Games' sequel to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a game we thoroughly enjoyed – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – and we're excited for others to play it. Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. 
More specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday. Digital owners don't need to worry about this as the patch will be installed as part of the pre-loaded version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

October 17, 2023
"The disc contains the entire game and is playable from start to finish with no patch or online requirement," Insomniac's statement reads. "But for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day – prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time. Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version." 
As for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Amnesia games are set decades apart, but they all begin in the same moment, a moment of waking that is also a moment of erasure and disconnection, a rebirth outside the flow of events from which to descend into the machine of history afresh. On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his "past self", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the "splendid architectures" below.
On 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.
Beware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If XCOM and Invisible, Inc. had a secret one-night stand in the back of a Cyberpunk 2077 taxi, the resulting lovechild would probably look a lot like Cyber Knights: Flashpoint. It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. 
There's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.

He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!


Sadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then. Speaking on the Xbox podcast last night (while sporting a boring Halo championship jacket), he suggested that Microsoft could do more to revive their older franchises.

A change in life priorities and an absence of trusted and skilled successors were mentioned as the main reasons. The decision triggered an outpouring of support and two people have stepped forward to keep the site going. This includes "God", one of FileList's original founders.

Paradox have announced that they're cutting the developer loose to pursue publishing opportunities elsewhere, following dismal sales of the studio's latest release, swaggering 1930s-set Indiana XCOMalike The Lamplighters League. Paradox will keep ownership of The Lamplighters League and other games developed by Harebrained, though the Crusader Kings publisher have no plans for a project or sequel in the same genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Intel's somewhat underwhelming 14th-gen processors today, I feel a lot of people are going to be looking once more at AMD Ryzen 7000 systems. These CPUs offer the same access to DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 components as Intel's latest offerings, yet typically consume less power while delivering better gaming performance at the high end. That makes it easier to build a balanced system, especially with deals on Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboards starting to become more commonplace. 
Case in point is this AWD-IT bundle deal on a Ryzen 5 7600X and an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard for £400, versus £445 for the two items separately. That's a pretty fair deal!

But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.
Despite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves. MW3's beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there's definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.

Hot on the heels of Mortal Kombat 1's launch, NetherRealm is already exploring new corners of the Mortal Kombat universe through a new mobile title, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught. This hero-collection, squad-based RPG lets you build teams of iconic fighters from the history of Mortal Kombat to take on various challenges. Ahead of its launch today, we had a chance to see the game in action to know what to expect from this new take on the long-running series.
Onslaught expands the Mortal Kombat universe into real-time squad-based combat. Players can unleash different, character-specific abi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fleetingly Epic Games-owned online audio distribution company Bandcamp have shed "at least" half their staff in the course of being sold off to Songtradr as part of mass layoffs at Epic this summer. That's according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.
It's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I am most moved and always have been by stupid courage — the kind when, against all odds, the hero just keeps going," William Goldman once said. This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.

Stupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.

The gist, for those who missed out on the demo: you walk around small islands punching resources out of the landscape, building crafting stations and dwellings, and slowly amassing the means to access other islands. Or, you ignore all that, and treat the whole thing as an idle clicker, with no time limit and no real opportunity to fail.

That's a welcome change; back in January, police forces all over the UK were instructed not to discuss visit numbers due to fears that the deterrent effect would be watered down.

Amongst other things, we can expect more robust search features, support for third-party subscriptions, better EGS launcher performance, a download manager with improved controls, and a new "for you" personalisation tab - all of that rolling out across 2024 and 2025.


Naturally, Epic will be continuing with their free games program through "2023 and beyond", and they've also put together a couple of special publishing offers for developers, Epic First Run and Now on Epic, which are designed to lure more studios from the amoeba-like embrace of Valve's gaming empire.

Case in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It sounds like Spider-Man 2 is pretty damn good, going by reviews that have appeared today ahead of the web-slinging sequel’s release on PlayStation 5 this Friday. While there’s no official word on a Spider-Man 2 PC version just yet, the appearance of previous PS5 exclusives over the last couple of years hopefully means it’s just a matter of time. The sooner, the better, based on what we’ve heard so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. 
Taking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upon its announcement as the grand finale of the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, Super Mario Bros. Wonder declared the series’ return to the 2D side-scrolling genre with a colorful bang. The game signals the return to Mario’s roots from a core gameplay perspective, but it’s more connected to Mario’s past than most people initially realized. While many remember the creative level design, expressive art style, and discovery of the game-changing Wonder Flowers, the most memorable moment came at the end of the announcement trailer, as everyone’s favorite plumber grabbed a never-before-seen item and transformed into an elephant. That moment told everyone that Super Mario Bros. Wonder, despite taking the series back to its 2D origins, is trying bold, new things unlike anything the franchise has seen before.

As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.
While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart serie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.


Moral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.

They've been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Analogue Pocket is a retro handheld marvel, capable of playing your favorite Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its beautiful screen with modern sensibilities and technology – simply put, it's the best way to play a Game Boy game, assuming you can get your hands on the always-sold-out device. Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. 
Analogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:
An image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: 
Analogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have "4 original-style controller ports," presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed "us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes," and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. 
Analogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). 

While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We talk about retro and throwback game releases being a "blast from the past", but in this case, it's more like you're strolling down a sunny path amid soothing birdsong, and then one particular, innocent-looking paving stone swivels underfoot with a rustle of gears, dropping you into a dingy, yellow-panelled room. There are vacuum tubes mounted on one wall, doors to either side, and a ladder leading further down into darkness.
You click one of the doors and the perspective switches over slide-projector style to a second room with identical proportions. There are pipes emerging from the floor, here, and some kind of antique radio on a pedastel in the centre. Hang on, I know this place. I know this formless sense of dread. I know these machinations. The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate. This is Submachine, a 14-part escape puzzle series from Mateusz Skutnik, which Skutnik has now compiled, polished-up and re-released as Submachine: Legacy.

Being the sequel to two excellent games is not a guarantee of success. But it does set strong expectations. Thankfully, Spider-Man 2 meets and exceeds those expectations, providing uniformly stellar superhero action characterized by blazing-fast combat, smart mission design, and regular injections of thrilling set-pieces. Behind all that excitement, it also houses a fervent and heartfelt commentary on second chances, rehabilitation, and redemption. As a result, even in its dark moments, Spider-Man 2 delivers a wholesome and optimistic adventure rooted in j…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft update 1.21 has been revealed, and well, looks like Mojang have been reading my posts demanding the addition of a proper maze generator, those sneaky devils. As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.
The headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.

Endless Dungeon is a very splashy, confidently clever roguelike about spannering turrets, hosing bullets, and popping bugs like angry little pimples. It sounds disgusting when I type it out loud like that, so let's pivot to the reliable food analogy. It is a delicious game, a hearty stew. A tasty one-more-go-er, perfectly suited to serving up in these dreary autumn months. There. Now that you've been pacified by the imagery of a steaming bowl of pleasing dungeon gumbo, you will forgive the 400 words I have written below about doors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The EGX demo for magic school adventure Leximan was perhaps only ten minutes long, but that's all it really needed to confirm that this wordy spell-caster is a riotous delight of a thing that should absolutely be on your radar. Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.

The presence of Sky, Premier League, DAZN, DFL, and BeIN, which has rights to FIFA, UEFA, NBA, and MLB, shows that live sports piracy remains pervasive and persistent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll admit I've been a bit sceptical of Loco Motive since it was first announced a little while ago. Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I see dirt, I know what I must do: clean. Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed in August that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario. Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani," Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!
October 13, 2023
Afghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder hits Switch exclusively on October 20. Ahead of its release, Mario graced the cover of the latest issue of Game Informer, and we've been diving deep into the making of the game and more in our exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder coverage hub. Here are some of the stories you can find in it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Sonic Superstars have a lot in common. Both feature 2D gameplay that veers close to the original vision for the franchise. Both offer co-op and competitive multiplayer options. Both deliver modernized visuals. And both give players new gameplay concepts and abilities that expand the original franchise vision in unprecedented ways. However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario's claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series' fates are forever intertwined. Sonic Superstars arrives on all consoles (including Switch) on October 17, just days before Super Mario Bros. Wonder lands exclusively on Switch on October 2…]]></summary>

The organization sees shadow libraries, including LibGen and Sci-Hub, as key problems, with the relatively new meta-search engine Anna's Archive also getting a mention. Third-party intermediaries pose problems too, the publishers note, with abuse of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as a growing concern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grotty fantasy Soulslike Lords of the Fallen - which I have been cautiously looking forward to, despite Ed's efforts to temper my expectations - is getting its chainmail-wearing arse kicked by Steam players. It seems to be selling well, squatting at third on the platform's global top seller charts by revenue, but the user review consensus tells a different story. There are 1,320 reviews at the time of writing, and they are Mostly Negative, which is quite the showing for a game's first day on sale.

This is an arcade blasting game through and through, where conscious strategy and placed shots soon shrink into rearview atoms as the pull of the machine gunner takes you and you realise you've been screaming for the last eight seconds. You drive a selection of vehicles across an increasingly ludicrous desert while everything in the universe tries to stop you. But you have guns. Or flamethrowers. That are bristling with ramming spikes. Or possibly all of the above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 out in the wild we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

As the bare buttocks of returning Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga indicated in the reveal trailer for Infinite Wealth, we’re not in Yokohama anymore, but Honolulu, Hawaii. He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. 
Alas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.

Earlier today, Microsoft officially acquired Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick revealed he will remain as CEO through the end of the year after Xbox head Phil Spencer asked him to stay to help with the company transition. While staying through the end of the year presumes Kotick will depart from the company in 2024, that remained technically unknown.
However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says that Kotick will depart from Activision Blizzard, a company he took over 33 years ago, on January 1, 2024.

One of Superstars’ biggest selling points is to take down Eggman with up to three other players. Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …]]></summary>

The CMA was the last hurdle for Microsoft's acquisition after it received approval in more than 40 countries and regions, including the U.S. earlier this summer. The deadline for Microsoft to close this deal was October 18, but reports indicated the company was planning to finalize it today, October 13.

The waves are nibbling playfully at the shoreline, the farmyard animals are shuffling about happily in their pens, your little sister is bouncing around being a perfect nuisance like always. Time to get busy, then. The cows need to be milked, the eggs need to be gathered from the chicken coop, the seeds need to be sowed and watered. 


You might find an hour to do a bit of scavenging, here and there - gathering mussels from the rocks at low tide, or putting aside some wood for that pier your dad asked you to build. Just, don't forget the gods. The gods have needs too. Today it's crabs. Tomorrow? Who knows.

But it's not alone; the Legend of Zelda series, which started around that time, also remains a genre leader all these decades later. During our discussions with Nintendo during our Super Mario Bros. Wonder cover story (and other interviews earlier this year), we tried to drill into why these franchises – in particular, the Mario franchise – have maintained their popularity and level of quality while so many other series have struggled to hold onto it for even a fraction of the time.
According to Mario series producer Takashi Tezuka, the tenure of the staff involved is a key part of keepin…]]></summary>

Ubisoft are working on an Assassin's Creed: Mirage patch that will let you toggle off chromatic aberration - aka the blurring of outlines and details for artistic effect, which you might consider appropriate to a game subtitled "Mirage", but which some people absolutely despise.

It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. "Lets you play your own Star Trek story" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.

The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a "surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape" in blissful Malibu.
There are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands. Here's a video of the opening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords Of The Fallen is a reboot of CI Games and Deck 13's 2014 action-RPG called… Lords Of The Fallen. We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.
Raise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.

Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. 
Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – …]]></summary>

Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft's biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. 
Thank you all for joining us on Basim's journey in 9th Century Baghdad!

Alongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: 
479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad
60 million Leaps of Faith
1.2 million street cats pet
"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception," Ubisoft's statement reads. "We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment." 


We had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review. If you're still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage tips and tricks. Read our interview with Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EGX 2023 is upon us, and you may recall that RPS is sponsoring the Rezzed Zone this year. That means we'll be tucking into the 50+ indie games that will be there over the coming days, and we can now confirm the full and final line-up of what's going to be on the showfloor. Most of these are only playable at the show, but you may still find some of them have demos available on Steam thanks to this week's Steam Next Fest. In any case, read on below to come and see what's coming up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.
But up front it tells you "There are no wrong choices, only your choices" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about "tracing different pathways" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. 
This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the "paragon of the future." The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a "deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces."


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive's scrapped version of Dead Island 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 
The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 


Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have "hundreds" of titles support this feature in the future. 
Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:
Japan – October 17
Europe – October 23
North America – October 30
As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming's mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you're a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming?

That seminal entry proved that Nintendo’s iconic plumber could transition to 3D and still be the juggernaut franchise it was in 2D. It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. 
In 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim. The visual improvements from the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube were apparent, and Super Mario Sunshine once again proved to be a hit with both fans and critics.

Amongst other things, Kotick allegedly discussed machine learning, Guitar Hero and the apocalyptic power of Microsoft R&D. Activision hired James Corden to host the meeting, the sources claim.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ara: History Untold's headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the "father of wargaming", in the mid-1800s. 


"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies," says Menard. "And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. 


"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?"

Ahead of that deal's finalization, we learned Activision Blizzard will not be putting the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass this year. Now, thanks to a new report from WindowsCentral, we've learned Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick held an all-hands employee meeting yesterday where former late-night show host James Corden interviewed him about future technology, the acquisition, and Guitar Hero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of usefulness to the average PC owner, sales events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days aren’t just for knocking hundreds off big-ticket hardware. They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. 


This has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hundreds of thousands of Minecraft players are downing pickaxes and revolting against what they feel to be Microsoft and Mojang's stingy approach to updating the decade-old sandbox building sim. The trigger is this year's Minecraft Mob Vote, a community ballot to decide which of three creatures will be added to the game. Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang's current headcount and Microsoft's resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps? And now, those players are trying to shut the whole thing down.

In 2010, eight million French pirates used the protocol but in 2022 that figure was down to just two million, a government report concludes. The challenge ahead is to suppress pirate IPTV and streaming sites, the latter of which coincidentally hit the mainstream roughly 12 years ago.

        <updated>2023-10-10T16:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models," the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. "There are four separate cover panels," it says, "with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte." This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed its "fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay:

As you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay.

Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup.

Here's what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
