Within Shadow Warrior 3’s opening minutes, protagonist Lo Wang stands in dirtied underwear, screaming profanities at a massive dragon outside his window. This comedic introduction sets the stage for a lighthearted and breezy approach to storytelling and combat – both satisfying in over-the-top ways while coming up a little short in scope and variety.
No matter what is happening on screen, developer Flying Wild Hog almost always goes for the cheap laugh. Zany pop culture references, a near endless stream of lines like “I think I just peed a li…]]></summary>

With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's reveal this past weekend, hindsight is very much on the side of Pokémon fans who have combed through recent games to find hints at what the future holds for the Pokémon series. A Reddit user may have found Gen 9 Easter eggs in not one but two recent Pokémon titles. 
In a Reddit post, a user named DDD-HERO points out a clever hint hidden within a hotel in Pokémon Sword and Shield:
The image above, taken by DDD-HERO, shows said wallpaper adorned with grapes and oranges. Those two fruits can be found all over in the Scarlet and Violet reveal trailer, including two plaques flanking a doorway, each featuring an icon representing either an orange or a bushel of grapes.
It's a great find from this web sleuth, who also came up with another possible hint in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Seen below, there's a flowerbed in Twinleaf town filled with red and purple flowers, now recognized as the color pair for Scarlet and Violet. DDD-HERO made sure to check the original versions of Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, finding that the fenced garden initially existed but with less-pronounced flowers of different colors. I'd say this is another hit of a hint!
Now to find one in Pokémon Legends: Arceus...
Check out the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right here, and find out which Pokémon are confirmed for the new duo of Switch titles so far.]]></summary>

It's always a popular — and accurate — go-to joke that Nintendo's online offering will be largely similar to whatever Xbox and PlayStation did a decade ago. Harsh, but often fair. Maybe, just maybe that's started to change in the Switch era.
Now, let's be upfront and say Nintendo is still on the cautious side when it comes to online technology. We still have no voice chat, unless you want to subject yourself to the mobile app for a small number of games. Some will also argue that the subscription service on offer with Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack don't offer enough value but... let's leave that for other times, shall we?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re an Apple Arcade subscriber or were a subscriber anytime after 2019, there’s a good chance you’ve heard of Spidersaurs, or have at least seen it in the service’s lineup.
If you haven’t yet played it there, or have and are looking for a new way to experience it, you’re in luck because Game Informer can exclusively reveal that Spidersaurs hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC this spring.

Inspired by classic action games with a dash of Saturday morning cartoons thrown in for good measure, Spidersaurs is an original game from WayForward, the team behind Contra 4. It pits you and one other player (if you’d like) against Spidersaurs, which are man-eating mutant spider dinosaurs, as the name implies. Originally designed in a lab to be meat and more for humans in need of supplies and resources, the Spidersaurs are loose and on a rampage against you and all of humanity.

However, Spidersaurs on console and PC isn’t simply a port of the Apple Arcade version first released in 2019. It comes with some new things like an all-new stage, a new true final boss, a new ending, two new difficulty settings, and two new unlockable modes: Arcade mode and Speedrun mode. WayForward says other tweaks and balance adjustments have been made as well, including mid-level checkpoints, rebalanced boss order, and numerous visual improvements. If you’re happy playing Spidersaurs on Apple Arcade, don’t fret – it will receive these updates as well. 
Spidersaurs is currently available on Apple Arcade on iOS devices and it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime this spring.

Release:

Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the legendary, long-running PlayStation racing franchise, is out on Friday. I'm currently speeding through the content, but I was slow off the line, so I'm not quite ready to render my final verdict. However, from what I've played, Gran Turismo 7 is everything players should want from a simulation racer. 
My first impression was just how flat-out gorgeous this game is. Yes, racing games typically are visual showcases, but Gran Turismo 7 is impressive even in a genre that includes the likes of Forza Horizon 5. Each vehicle, track, and environment is meticulously modeled, giving you a true sense of immersion as you drive at blistering speeds. Around every turn, the beauty of Polyphony Digital's work is unavoidable.
Unlike Forza Horizon 5, Gran Turismo 7 is a sim racer that takes place on closed tracks. That means you won't be exploring a vast, open world or launching yourself off ramps, but there is plenty of fun to be had. Whether you're competing in white-knuckled races over the course of several laps, completing activities to satisfy special missions, or racking up mileage in special time trials set to musical playlists, Gran Turismo 7 offers a diverse set of content. Not only that, but it appeals heavily to the collector in me, continually encouraging me to build as robust a garage of vehicles as I can.
Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec captivated me more than two decades ago and was perhaps the most-played game on my PlayStation 2. The series hasn't held my attention to that extent in the time since, but even in my early stages, I can feel Gran Turismo 7 begin to sink its hooks in me. Only time will tell if this game will steal hours upon hours from me the way Gran Turismo 3 did, but so far, I'm having a great time with the latest from Polyphony Digital.]]></summary>

Have you survived the zombie hordes and now you’re looking for some new challenges? The upcoming Back 4 Blood expansion, Tunnels of Terror, comes with some fearsome fare that even the most seasoned survivors will have to adapt to. In a tweet today, Back 4 Blood laid out a bit of the new content scheduled to arrive on April 12.
Tunnels of Terror will be coming to Fort Hope on April 12th, 2022. Here's a little sneak peek on what to look forward to! pic.twitter.com/AOrigv2UuK
March 1, 2022
The update includes two new cleaners, Sharice and Heng, and three kinds of warped ridden to face-off against. Yes, that’s a fire axe that Sharice is wielding, so the undead are in serious trouble. The potentially much bigger news is that a new PvE experience is also coming with this update, the ridden hives. Of course, there are all kinds of new loot to be had as well, so that should have cleaners crawling back to camp to take on these new threats. Warped chests, new cards, and legendary weapons are all on deck to help fight back against the undead tide.
The Tunnels of Terror is scheduled to land on April 12 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you planning to head into the tunnels?

Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.
There's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing "hahaha" of old. And it makes me sad.

Capcom announced that the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes along with Resident Evil 7 Biohazard are making their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S this year. 
The move to more powerful hardware means these titles will boast new enhancements such as ray tracing, 3D audio, and, according to a press release, “high frame rate”. Capcom doesn’t specify what that means but one would assume the games will hit at least 60 fps since that’s the benchmark for current-gen titles. The PS5 versions feature Dual Sense haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support as well. 
Best of all, if you already own these games on last-gen consoles you’ll get a free upgrade to the new versions (with Smart Delivery on Xbox). A free upgrade patch is also coming to the PC versions. There’s no release date for these re-releases but expect them in 2022. 
Resident Evil 7 Biohazard launched in 2017 and was hailed as a return to form for the series, shifting the perspective to first-person and getting back to the franchise’s survival horror roots. Its direct sequel, Resident Evil Village, arrived in 2021. The remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 were similarly celebrated as smart reimaginings of the PS1 classics, reinventing them using Resident Evil 4’s over-the-shoulder gameplay.

At this point I’d already been testing it for a while, and as you can now tell from my Steam Deck review, was already sold on both the promise and (mostly) the execution of this plastic go-anywhere gaming machine. Now, it was time to find out more about how it came to be, what new tricks we can expect in the future, and what work is already going to on ensure compatibility with as many Steam games as possible.

The Legend of Heroes series has had a big Crossbell-shaped gap in the West for ages. Last year, we finally got confirmation that we would be receiving both games in the fan-titled Crossbell duology, along with two other entries in this gargantuan series. Now, we know exactly when we'll be able to join the Special Support Service.
Fresh off of revealing its new logo yesterday, NIS America has announced that The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero — the first game in the Crossbell duology and the fourth game in the Trails/Kiseki series — will launch on 27th September in North America and 30th September in Europe. That feels a lot closer than just saying Fall 2022, doesn't it?

It's a "playable short" - basically a 30-minute tech demo designed for the Steam Deck, to show off how to use all the little flaps and controller bits on Valve's new handheld PCxGameboy toy (like the Aperture Hand Lab for VR from a few years back). Crucially, though, Aperture Desk Job is: a) free; 2) playable on a regular PC; and iii) set in the Portal universe.
In fact, it has surprisingly large implications for said game series (no spoilers in this post, btw). And it just reminds me how good Valve are at, you know, making games. Please, Valve, make more games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After purchasing the anime streaming service, Crunchyroll, last year, Sony Pictures Entertainment is shifting its other anime-focused service, Funimation, and all of its content under the Crunchyroll banner.
Effective immediately, Crunchyroll is now the home to an even more massive library of anime titles including many English dubs that previously were produced by and presented by Funimation. A full list can be found on the Crunchyroll site, but here are some of the shows now available for Crunchyroll viewers:
Attack on Titan: Junior High (Sub and Dub)
Black Clover ep. 1–170 (Dub)
Cowboy Bebop (Sub and Dub)
Darling in the Franxx (Dub)
Dr. Stone seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)
Fire Force seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)
Fruits Basket seasons 1-3 (Dub)
Hunter x Hunter ep. 1–74 (Dub)
My Hero Academia seasons 1–5 (Dub)
Scarlet Nexus (Dub)
Sk8 the Infinity (Sub and Dub)
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime seasons 1 and 2 and OADs (Dub)
Tokyo Ghoul (Dub)
Yu Yu Hakusho ep. 1-112 and OVAs (Sub and Dub)
Yuri!!! on Ice (Dub)
Starting with the upcoming spring season for anime, Crunchyroll will be the place to catch subs and dubs of any new anime for both Sony-owned streamers. Funimation users will only be able to watch new episodes of series already existing on the Funimation service, so now is definitely the time to migrate over to Crunchyroll. To encourage the switch and ease the transition, Funimation subscribers will be receiving an email with an offer for 60 days of a premium Crunchyroll subscription for free. 
Crunchyroll recently became one of four streaming apps available on the Nintendo Switch, and with this consolidation, renders Funimation's Switch app obsolete, bringing the count ostensibly back down to three.]]></summary>

Popular anime streaming service Crunchyroll recently launched on Nintendo Switch, with some positive first impressions to boot. Now, the service has gotten a heck of a lot bigger with the absorption of Funimation and most of its related content.
The change is effective immediately, with the move encompassing Funimation, its subsidiary Wakanim, and Crunchyroll's own VRV service. The company states that this will create the world's largest anime library all under one roof. As a small caveat, however, the site's FAQ section states that 80% of the Funimation library will move across, so there may be a few movies or shows that have not yet made the jump.

Today, the Switch was meant to see the release of The Chinese Room's latest game, Little Orpheus. However, the studio has announced that they will be delaying the launch of the game due to "recent world events", with no new date proposed.

We've all heard plenty of stories about poor working conditions for those in the video game industry - perhaps most recently with Team17 - so it's lovely to see companies taking positive actions to improve the lives of the people who create the games we love.
Bandai Namco has moved to increase the base salary of its Japanese staff as part of a wider initiative to 'Connect with Fans'. The publisher has stated that it will boost the monthly earnings for its employees by ¥50,000 ($435), bringing their base monthly salary up from ¥232,000 ($2000) to ¥290,000 ($2500).

We're only days away from the release of Triangle Strategy, Square Enix's HD-2D tactical RPG. Turn-based tactical RPG fans around the world have been clamouring for a brand new entry in the genre from the company that brought us Final Fantasy Tactics. And from the sounds of an early review, it looks like we're in for a treat.
Famed Japanese magazine Famitsu has published their thoughts on the game (thanks, Nintendo Everything), with three reviewers giving Triangle Strategy a 9, and the fourth giving it an 8. That's 35/40, which is pretty darn promising!

Gosh, just from trailers and previews, what we've already heard of the Mina the Hollower soundtrack is absolutely brilliant. Yacht Club Games staple Jake Kaufman is back with just as much chiptune flare as he had in Shovel Knight, and the quality of Mina the Hollower's music is already looking to rival the spade-wielder's own.
And now even more so, as Yacht Club games has announced that the legendary Yuzo Koshiro, of Streets of Rage and Etrian Odyssey fame, will be contributing two tracks to the game. If you've never heard of Yuzo Koshiro then we urge you to take a few hours to listen to something he's worked on (his work on Streets of Rage 4 is phenomenal).

As if Elden Ring wasn't enough game to be getting on with, we also had strategy behemoth Total War: Warhammer 3 alongside surprise hit Lost Ark. You could argue that after a month as busy as February, we could all do with a bit of space to actually play these enormous games before we throw anything else onto our already bursting backlogs.
Sadly, I come bearing terrible news. March is yet another jam-packed month for new releases, with huge titles such as GhostWire: Tokyo and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands threatening to tear our attention away from the wonderful Elden Ring. And that’s before I tell you about promising indie releases like Tunic and Weird West!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decisions, decisions...
It's often a trend in anticipated Indie games to have an eShop release and then, months later when many have cracked and bought the download, a special or limited physical edition is revealed. That won't be the case with Omori, pleasingly, as it's been confirmed that Fangamer will sell a physical edition for $34.99; pre-orders are open with shipping due to start on 17th June. Intriguingly the game still only has a 'Spring' window for the eShop, but presumably it'll get a formal release date in the coming weeks.
Having released on Steam in December the game has had an extraordinary response, with over 30,000 user reviews being 'overwhelmingly positive'. It's a game that's been intriguing since it was originally planned for 3DS, with EarthBound stylings and a 'horror RPG' approach. It seems to be one of those games with the creativity and writing to have a big impact on its players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not again!

Nvidia has reportedly been hit by the "mother of all cyber attacks" over the weekend (via TechPowerUp) - resulting in all sorts of leaks, and some of the findings have reignited speculation about a possible Nintendo Switch successor. It's got to the point where both 'Switch Pro' and 'Switch 2' are currently trending on social media platforms. Switch 2, in particular, has generated more than 25k messages on platforms like Twitter at the time of writing.

If you've been able to get your hands on a Steam Deck and are worried about the reported "drift" issues, it seems there's no need to panic.
Valve, in record time (not Valve time, thankfully), has already issued a fix to address the supposed issues associated with the Steam Deck thumbsticks. This information comes directly from Valve designer, Lawrence Yang, in an update over on Twitter.

Unless you live under a rock, you've probably heard about a game called Elden Ring over the past week. It's the latest title from the team at FromSoftware (the same developer behind the popular Dark Souls series).
If Elden Ring wasn't already enough of a challenge for most players, one guy has able to increase the difficulty by adding a Ring Fit Adventure controller (known as the Ring-Con) to the fight. Yes, that's right - modder and Ring Fit enthusiast Super Louis 64 has returned, this time for Elden Ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you missed out on watching the Marvel Defenders series like Daredevil and Jessica Jones while they were on Netflix, as of yesterday those shows are no longer available. The good news is Disney is making room on its streaming service for all of the MCU-related TV shows.
The countdown is on. Marvel's Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, The Punisher, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. start streaming March 16 on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/U80cfZCPa8
March 1, 2022
Starting on March 16, Disney+ will be the exclusive place to watch every season of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Punisher, The Defenders, and even former ABC series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. which was conspicuously missing from the Marvel lineup. Those shows will join the already accessible Agent Carter on Disney+ that weren't natively made for the service, nor strictly tied to the current Marvel Cinematic Universe storylines. However, the Netflix roster, which has always been part of the MCU canon, has only recently started to be more directly referenced in the newer movies/Disney+ shows so bringing them home makes more sense than ever. 
Disney and Marvel haven't said whether the series migrating to Disney+ will receive any additional seasons, specials, or even films, but with all of these shows hitting the mothership streaming service certainly leaves some doors open. As for the saucier nature of the former Netflix series (these aren't fun family-friendly romps), United States subscribers to Disney+ will see some "updated parental controls" landing alongside the shows. Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand will also have access to these shows on March 16.]]></summary>

Every adventure is a journey of some sort, but we are often so consumed with the destination we sometimes forget to enjoy the ride. Far: Changing Tides pushes you to soak in the small moments that can be overlooked in our rush to reach the peak. Okomotive newest side-scrolling platformer is a meditative odyssey full of trials and triumphs. But this pilgrimage is so powerful I was often content to forget about my end goal.

WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K has spent the last few weeks rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. 
2K has finally unveiled the full, complete roster (excluding DLC characters, of which Machine Gun Kelly was recently announced). WWE fans will be most surprised …]]></summary>

But now, according to a leak (via ShiinaBR on Twitter), Mr Knife-Sleeves himself will reportedly be making his way to Fortnite. Apparently, a recent patch contained info on the new skin, alongside a new emote, new outfit, and a new harvesting tool, all related to our boy Stabby McGee.

Ah, we do love a good port for the Nintendo Switch. After all, the best way to play a game is in bed, which the PlayStations and Xboxes of the world can't really manage without a whole living room/bedroom remodel. But the Switch gets a lot of sub-par ports with grainy, low-resolution art or — even worse for some — Cloud Editions, which force players without great internet to deal with compression artefacts and connection issues all over the shop.
So it's very nice to see a port that has extra time put into the Switch version, like Life is Strange: True Colors, which was done by development studio Dragon's Lake, and is covered in this technical behind-the-scenes video.

Rennala Queen of the Full Moon is the demigod, or rather has one in her possession, who resides in the Raya Lucaria Academy legacy dungeon. The motherly sorceress is in the Grand Library, surrounded by her orphaned disciples, and casts powerful magic attacks. Unlike Margit or Godrick, this is a relatively easy fight – especially for melee-focused users. In this Elden Ring boss guide, I’ll show you how to beat Rennala Queen of the Full Moon. 
Overview
Rennala has two phases she transitions between at half health. The first is more a puzzle than a battle, while the second is a moonlit duel …]]></summary>

Demon’s Souls started it all. Sure, folks will argue that the concepts that would go on to become the modern-day Soulslike started even earlier in From Software’s history with games like Shadow Tower or the King’s Field games. But the modern incarnations feature challenging action/RPGs that offer battles with larger-than-life bosses, risk/reward offerings, mysteries to explore, and tight combat mechanics that force the player to commit to their choices. 
For the purposes of this list, I’m acknowledging that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has plenty of Soulslike framework, but d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent update to the Nintendo Switch has brought a new feature called Missions and Rewards. While not quite achievements, these little tasks encourage Switch owners to use and explore the Switch Online service.
With the update now available, anyone subscribed to Nintendo Switch Online has access to Missions and Rewards. This feature adds tasks that, when completed, will shell out a handful of My Nintendo Platinum Points upon completion. Missions to complete include backing up a save to the cloud or booting up Super Mario Bros. in the Switch Online NES collection or other ways to make sure you're exploring everything you can do with your online subscription. To view these missions, simply head to the Nintendo Switch Online app on the Switch's home screen.
Since the rewards available use the already existing Platinum Points, you may already have a pile of coins stashed away to redeem on a host of new digital items like new icon elements. These elements are character photos, frames, and backgrounds used to build and customize an icon image for your Switch profile. Right now, Switch Online users can pay Platinum Points for Animal Crossing and Mario Odyssey-themed icon parts, with a fresh set of icon elements becoming available each month. Or you can just save up the Platinum Points for the physical and digital prizes already offered in the My Nintendo program. 
For other recent additions and announcements for Nintendo Switch Online, check out the new additions of Earthbound and Earthbound Beginnings to the service, and the reveal of new tracks coming to Mario Kart 8 in the very near future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valve haven’t changed their collective minds on DIY Steam Deck upgrades and repairs; although the portable PC is finally on its way to the earliest reservers, it’s still the company’s stance that you shouldn’t open it up and make hardware changes yourself. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who spoke to us at length on the making of the Deck and its future prospects.


Valve have previously made the peculiar move of showing exactly how to open a Steam Deck and remove individual parts, complete with video, while simultaneously declaring it something owners should refrain from. On pain of borking components, personal injury, and even death, apparently.

Young Souls was a rare Stadia timed-exclusive that launched last August and impressed us with its entertaining blend of beat-em-up combat and run-based dungeon crawling. Curious players on other platforms had to endure a lengthy delay to try the game themselves, but Young Souls finally has a console and PC release date, and it's just over a week from now. 
On March 10, you can play Young Souls on PlayStation 4, Xbox One (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC. The game stars two orphaned twins living in a small town that must rescue their adoptive father after an underground goblin kingdom kidnaps him. Either alone or with one other player, you'll brawl your way through dungeons using your fists or outfitted with a variety of weapons and armor. Playing alone manages to be just as enjoyable thanks to a smart tag-team mechanic that lets you instantly swap between each sibling to chain combos and preserve health. The new trailer below provides a full breakdown of the game's features.

I scored Young Souls an 8.5 out of 10, describing it as "an exceptional adventure you shouldn't miss if you're searching for the next great game to tackle with a friend or want a quality RPG brawler to dig into alone." You can read my full review here.]]></summary>

You are Vix (vikfikfok), an fox wot fixes things in a distant future, where humans started to gene-splice themselves with animals for the convenience of having, for example, lovely warm fur. This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.
Vix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time. Part puzzle game, part sci-fi adventure, part fok.

For any enthusiasts following Elden Ring’s entire development process, it can still be pretty easy to forget that George R.R. Martin lent his talent to the game’s central plot. From Software’s titles are synonymous with emergent storytelling – predominantly found in gameplay interactions – and periphery beats discovered within the flavor text of equippable gear and other items. Martin’s inclusion might not have changed that age-old formula, but it’s hard not to see Elden Ring’s Western fantasy influences (e.g., Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones) in the art design and overarching narra…]]></summary>

However, if you’re lucky enough to get a Steam Deck in the first round of order fulfilments, you could see improvements that have yet to materialise on Windows.

February sure has been one of those months, what with two of the biggest games of the year so far, not to mention a whole new piece of hardware launching in the space of two measly weeks. If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  
Of course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March? The answer is... complicated.

Elden Ring is out and here to stay. And while all versions of the game are widely praised, Elden Ring’s success story on PC is awe-inspiring, with Steam numbers reaching record-breaking heights. Nevertheless, the latest From Software blockbuster isn’t without controversies or critiques. Some players are baffled by the absence of a pause screen despite being an oppressive aspect of all Soulsborne titles. That’s right; you’re forever in-game while playing Elden Ring, meaning your Tarnished avatar is susceptible to ambushes and other devastating scenarios while parsing through the various “s…]]></summary>

Godrick The Grafted is the ruler of Stormveil Castle, the first legacy dungeon in Elden Ring. This mandatory boss is a demi-god whose body is clad by extremities taken from his previous victims. Godrick is incredibly agile despite his large size, capable of using his storm-calling abilities to launch into the air or whirl massive gusts of wind. During his second phase, the disgraced lord grafts a dragon head onto his arm, spewing streams of deadly fire. Godrick is a nasty foe, but the good news is he’s easier to beat than Margit The Fell Omen.

Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can't wait. However, there's still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we'll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon.

"We are always looking to improve, but, in our games specifically, hardship is what gives meaning to the experience," he says. "So it’s not something we’re willing to abandon at the moment. It’s our identity."

I spent 24 hours playing on Valve's new handheld, the Steam Deck, and tested 23 popular games to see how they run out-of-the-box on the portable gaming PC. To my surprise, several unverified titles run great on Steam Deck, while unfortunately, some iconic PC games run poorly. We tested top games like Ark: Survival Evolved, Cyberpunk 2077, DOTA 2, DOOM Eternal, Halo Infinite, Lost Ark, Skyrim Anniversary Edition, Rust, and Valheim.
Check out the video below to see the results:

Smilegate and Tripod Studio’s newly localized Action/RPG Lost Ark initially launched in South Korea several years ago, and thanks to its western publisher Amazon Games, English territories are now getting their hands on it. While Lost Ark may look and play like Diablo or Path of Exile, it’s an MMO through and through, featuring engaging group content like dungeons, raids, and world bosses within a vast, explorable globe. My time with Lost Ark has had some ups and downs, but the more I stuck with it, the more I wanted to spend time in its world.

If you’re a Final Fantasy VII fan, then you’ve probably contributed to the discourse about who is the classic JRPG’s best heroine and Cloud’s canon love interest. Tifa and Aerith (or Aeris) are some of gaming history’s most recognizable fighters as both contribute to VII’s moment-to-moment action in significant ways. Remake upped the bar, moving away from traditional turn-based combat so that players could truly witness the freneticism/power of Tifa’s martial arts and the seemingly infinite magical capabilities of Aerith. Now, The Batman’s Robert Patti…]]></summary>

This news comes by way of Kotaku, which first reported that auction site Goldin announced it’d be auctioning off the rare card. The owner of this now-$900,000 card remains unknown at the time of this writing, but the final auction price blows past previous records for a single Pokémon card. 
That previous record was $375,000 and it was the selling price for a “Near Mint 7” version of Illustrator Pikachu sold in February of last year. This new one also carried with it a “Near Mint 7” condition, and it was sold on February 23. Kotaku reports that it was one of only …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a few minutes out of Elex 2’s, pleasantly brief, tutorial area I came across a radio. The broadcast was announcing a concert at the nearby amphitheatre. A Billy Idol concert. Yeah, you read that right. I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.


There is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.

However, as anyone who’s ever looked into the history of this spinoff knows, Zero Racers (sometimes known as G-Racers), was never released. This likely had less to do with the game and more to do with the Virtual Boy’s commercial failure. Yes, the Virtual Boy has garnered a fanbase over the past few decades, but at the end of the day, it wasn’t a success. That lack of success likely led to games like Zero Racers never becoming a reality…or so we thought because it turns out Zero Racers was complete and ready for play.

It's been nearly three years since the release of Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield, which began Generation 8 of the long-running pocket monster-catching series. And now, following yesterday's reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, we'll be diving headfirst into Generation 9 later this year on the Switch. 
Click here to watch embedded media
A new generation of Pokémon is exciting for a number of reasons. There's the new story to unravel, a brand-new region to explore, and of course, new Pokémon to catch. Perhaps more exciting than all of that, though, are the three starter Pokémon that we'll be beginning our new Scarlet and Violet adventures with. It's the first big decision we'll all be making in Generation 9, other than choosing which version to play in the first place, and it's one that will stick with us for the entire duration (unless you're a heathen who doesn't use their starter on their journey to the Elite Four). 
As expected, there are three starters to choose from: The Grass-type cat Sprigatito, the Fire-type croc Fuecoco, and the Water-type duckling Quaxly. 
Click here to view embedded media
 

For me, I'm going with Quaxly. It's not my favorite design of the group, to be honest, but since Generation 1, I've always chosen the Water-type starter (except in Sword and Shield because goodness, I loathed the design of Inteleon). I like Quaxly's design enough that I'll be able to return to my old habits, and that's exciting. I have to say, though – Fuecoco's giving me big Totodile vibes and Totodile is an all-time great starter. Sprigatito is a cat, though, and who doesn't love a good cat Pokémon? 
With all of that in mind, we want to know: which starter Pokémon are you choosing in Scarlet or Violet? Which version of this generation do you plan on picking up – Scarlet or Violet? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

A man who invents successive tales of fantasy in an effort to stay his likely execution by an impatient general interrogating him in a dark room. Ivan is the little guy in every sense, small in stature, a hunching underdog to forces beyond his control. As the likeable hero of Little Orpheus, a vibrant modernising of the cinematic platformer, he builds a rapport with the general that carries the game as best it can through eight beautiful but ultimately formulaic levels. This is a light game, unchallenging by design, and for me, sleepily so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Warrior 3 continues the series tradition of completely rebooting the style of each game. This time it’s going for a more linear arena shooter style, similar to 2013's Shadow Warrior, and it’s got generally the right idea. You play as the former freelance mercenary Lo Wang, and mainly just try to get from A to B. This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you. Whenever you’re not clearing out enemies in an arena setting, you’ll be parkouring between them, or using your skills to navigate some setpieces. That's basically it, that's the game.

But with three mainline games and a plethora of spinoffs, many have wondered where the Gearbox Software posterchild would go next. The answer is Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, and we're showing off some brand new gameplay in today's video!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an owner of two cats who regularly bring home all manner of half-eaten wildlife from the neighbouring bins, hedgerows and overgrown student gardens, I often wonder how these adorable murderers are perceived by the local mice and rat population. If it's anything like ginger puss cat Tiger in Jeremy "Aviary Attorney" Noghani's turn-based RPG Small Saga, they're going to be in trouble, as these rodents come bearing switchblades and cigarette lighters to fend off their deadly foes. It's an intriguing take on the classic Final Fantasy-like job types of other RPGs - the switchblade is to protagonist Verm what Cloud's Buster Sword is to a regular human, while Siobhan's lighter allows her to cast fire 'magic' as the party's mage - and based on its hour-long Steam Next Fest demo, it's shaping up to be just as grand a tale as its lauded genre mates.

If you were looking to add the mythical Pokémon Shaymin to your party or your Pokédex in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl, today’s your lucky day. 
That’s because Shaymin will soon be available to catch in the remakes later today as a Mystery Gift event. Announced during today’s Pokémon Day stream, which also saw the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet alongside the Daybreak Update for Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Shaymin hits the game via something called Oak’s Letter. 
After receiving the Oak’s Letter Mystery Gift, you’ll be able to encounter Shaymin and catch the mythical Pokémon and add it to your team. As noted by the trailer, it takes approximately two hours of play time before the Mystery Gift feature is unlocked in new playthroughs of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. 
You have plenty of time, though, to take part in this Mystery Gift event because while it’s live starting today, it will be remain live until March 27 so you have over a month to add Shaymin to your Pokédex. 
While waiting to receive Oak’s Letter, read about the Pokémon Legends: Arceus Daybreak update, which is out later today, and then watch the reveal trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. 
Are you excited to add Shaymin to your party? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

Pokémon Legends: Arceus is getting a new update, Version 1.1.0, otherwise known as Daybreak, later today. 
Announced today during the Pokémon Day stream, which ended with the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, Daybreak will add a new investigation to Game Freak’s latest pocket monster RPG. You’ll be tasked with beginning an investigation into a new phenomenon that is causing a mass outbreak of what appear to be Alpha Pokémon.

As you can see in the trailer above, the phenomenon is causing some of the most challenging types of Pokémon in the game to appear all over the place and it seems it will be up to you to figure out first what’s going on, and then discover a way to stop it. It’s not a bad time to be catching some powerful Pokémon if you’re up to the challenge, though. 
The Daybreak update will also bring new Pokémon battles to the training grounds in-game. Seemingly addressing one of players’ biggest complaints, this new update will make it so that there are more Pokémon battles against other trainers to take part in. As for how many or how often, who knows but fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to find out because the Daybreak update hits Pokémon Legends: Arceus later today. 
To coincide with Pokémon Day, players who use the password "ARCEUSADVENTURE" in-game will receive 30 Ultra Balls, 30 Gigaton Balls, and 30 Jet Balls. 
For more, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about Generation 9, which was just revealed today as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.

The next mainline Pokémon games have been revealed as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, and they’ll be released on the Switch in “late 2022.” 
This news comes by way of today’s Pokémon Day stream.

This year’s included plenty of that, but it ended with the big reveal that Generation 9 is coming this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In between the Steam Deck reviews and Gabe Newell interviews yesterday came a surprise announcement of a new, short game from Valve. Aperture Desk Job takes place in the Portal universe and stars Grady, a new personality core, setting you product testing challenges while you sit in front of controls that look suspicously like a Steam Deck.

You won't need a Steam Deck to play it, though, when it launches on March 1st.

After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Now, halfway through the series, we reach one of the more divisive entries: Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception.  
Developed by Naughty Dog, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console on November 1, 2011. After the success of Uncharted 2 and it's blockbuster setpieces, Naughty Dog upped the stakes and pushed to include even more spectacular action moments. Unfortunately, that put a toll on development. In this episode, we talk about Uncharted 3's renewed focus on melee combat, how Last of Us' development impacted the team, and why Uncharted 3 almost shipped with a game-breaking bug. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and co-founder and the CEO of Kinda Funny Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's third outing.  
If you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel. From there, find the Video Gameography channel under "Community Spaces."]]></summary>

Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous is an animated series on Netflix that ties into the Jurassic theatrical releases, much like The Clone Wars connects to the Star Wars movies. Despite targeting a younger demographic, Camp Cretaceous is surprisingly dark, telling the tale of a handful of children who travel to a dinosaur camp, only to be lost in the wilderness and hunted by the thunder beasts.
Jurassic World Evolution 2's newest DLC offering dives into the expanded lore of Camp Cretaceous and will be released on March 8 for $9.99. You won't see any of…]]></summary>

Gran Turismo 7 launches on March 4, and driving sim enthusiasts are in a tizzy asking themselves one burning question: how would the game's beautifully rendered cars look if Kirby ate them? You haven't seen it, but they're definitely wondering about this. 
That's because Kirby and the Forgotten Land also launches in March and debuts his new suction ability: Mouthful Mode. This was memorably demonstrated with the pink fluff inhaling a car and taking on its shape in the most adorable form of body horror I've ever seen. That same car is probably in Gran Turismo 7 (it's got a bazillion vehicles, so …]]></summary>

Martha Is Dead starts extremely strong, introducing immediately a dynamic between twin sisters Martha and Giulia that sets the stage for the entire game. Giulia’s mother never loved her the way she loved Martha, and this relationship, or lack thereof, has eaten away at Giulia’s spirits for years. After Giulia finds Martha, drowned in a lake, her mother runs to embrace Giulia, mistakenly believing her least-favorite child perished. Finally, she gets the love and affection she’s always wanted. What happens next is unexp…]]></summary>

Margit The Fell Omen is the first mandatory boss you’ll encounter in Elden Ring. You’ll find his fog gate inside the Castleward Tunnel, which begins at the top of Stormhill, the wind-swept lands northeast of the starting area called Limgrave. The hammer-wielding steward is old but quick on his feet and poses a more significant threat to slower melee-focused players, especially those of a lower level. If you’re still trying to figure out how to beat Margit The Fell Omen, we’ve got you covered. In this Elden Ring boss guide, we’ll show you how to find a unique item to make the fight much mo…]]></summary>

This week's episode of All Things Nintendo is all about celebrating the first five years of the Nintendo Switch. The anniversary is right around the corner, so Brian invites Game Informer online content director Ben Reeves back to talk about the biggest milestones of the Switch's first half-decade, as well as share some stories from the last five years covering the system.
Note: Brian is out on assignment this week, so this episode was recorded a week early. If any noteworthy news hit over the last week, All Things Nintendo will cover it next week.

Knockout City, the popular EA Originals dodgeball game developed by Velan Studios, is officially going free-to-play with the start of Year 2. 
This news comes by way of a new post by Velan on EA’s Knockout City page. In it, the studio reveals that following the conclusion of the current Season 5, Season 6 will kick off Year 2, which will in turn kick off the game’s transition into a free-to-play title. What’s more is that Velan will be saying goodbye to its publishing partner, EA, to self-publish future content for the title. 
Moving forward from Season 6 and onward,…]]></summary>

Valve’s Steam Deck launches today, meaning its first wave of customers will soon be gaming on a shiny (and very large) handheld PC and looking for things to play. The device can’t play every title and Steam recently rolled out new library categories to better label which of your games work on the Deck and which don’t. Publisher THQ Nordic has assisted on this front by revealing which of its many titles are playable on Steam Deck at launch.  
In a press release, THQ has listed the following titles as Steam Deck Verified. That means they’re fully functional on the handheld:
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition
Darksiders Genesis
Desperados III
This is the Police 2
The next batch of titles is Steam Deck Playable. This is a step below Verified status because while these games work on the device, they may require some manual tweaking to get them running at full capacity:
Battle Chasers: Nightwar
Biomutant
Darksiders: Warmastered Edition
Destroy All Humans! (2020)
Elex
Expeditions: Rome
MX vs ATV All Out
Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated
This is the Police
There are currently over 300 titles confirmed to be playable on Steam Deck and that number will grow as Valve and developers work to get games running on the handheld. Other confirmed titles include Persona 4, Dota 2, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Inscryption, and Valheim.

The aim was to answer as many as possible in time for the system’s official launch, which is today!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of my Steam Deck review testing, the majority of games I tried ran without issue. Some didn’t get on with SteamOS’s Proton compatibility software, and others needed a bit more work on the ol’ anti-cheat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if most Steam games end up rated as Verified or Playable in Valve’s compatibility review programme.
What, then, are some of the very best games to play on the Steam Deck? Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions. Here's what they've been playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ubisoft to Konami to the Epic Games Store, games companies are doubling down on NFTs as fast as others are backtracking on them. Valve, on the other hand, aren’t likely to get involved any time soon, owing to “a lot of criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviours”. That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.


While indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering. Steam banned games with NFTs and cryptocurrency last year.

A few minutes into playing on this – the first serious attempt at a handheld PC from a major gaming entity - and I am once more a child, alternating between sinking into the sofa to redirect energy into my thumbs and wanting desperately to rush round my friends’ houses to show them the cool new thing. 


Not that the Steam Deck is a nostalgia exercise, given it’s built to run the very latest AAA games as much as it is indies and retros. And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset. But the Steam Deck is more accessible, more affordable, and far more useful to have on a train.

Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.
Valve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.

The nature of that appeal is quite different depending on your perspective. Some primarily console-focused gamers may find a low-cost entry into at least part of the PC gaming experience. For more dedicated PC players, it provides a chance to take what may already be an extensive Steam library on the go – albeit with only specific titles optimized right now. Either way, the Steam Deck is an impressive first step into a promising future of portable PC play – with some significant issues holding it back from greatness.

Blood West isn't the same as Hunt, but they're definitely related. It also wears its love of Blood on its sleeve. It also also carries Thief DNA, and even takes some notes from Dark Souls, a game I dislike because it's bad and everyone is just wrong. Most remarkably though, Blood West feels almost entirely itself, rather than just an assembly of other things. It's really damn good.

Elden Ring is doing very well – its Steam numbers are already nearly six times greater than From Software’s previous all-time high – but some players have criticized the game’s performance, particularly on PC. 
From Software has released a new launch-day message specifically addressing the performance issues some are experiencing in Elden Ring and it seems some fixes could soon be on the way. The message addresses issues happening on console versions of the game and PC versions of it, too.

Eventually you're able to strike up a bit of a relationship with the big lizard and build a sort of symbiotic relationship. Onbu stays on track, Onbu gets a treat. Good Onbu.
I'm not usually one for strategy games where you've got to manage rocks and wood and allocate workers. Some of that comes down to their many systems frying my little brain, but Onbu has me persevering. Why? Because the resources I'm harvesting and community I'm building help or hinder Onbu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking for a spot of jolly cooperation this weekend, other than Elden Ring, round up the crew and get rowdy in Deep Rock Galactic. The excellent cooperative FPS, where we play as spaceDwarves gathering spacegems and battling spacebugs in destructible spacemines, is holding a free trial weekend on Steam to celebrate its fourth birthday. It is a (rock) cracking game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harriers are rare among the bird family, in that they’re one of the very few birds to have been overtaken in popularity by their namesake fighter jet*. Mention a harrier anywhere outside of an ornithology summit and people will assume you’re talking about the hovering aeroplane rather than the diurnal hawk. Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. 


So it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks.

Typical playground fantasy for those not good enough to be picked for football: battles under the netball hoops with weapons no one could see.

Since the onset of chronic illness that left me cognitively limited in 2015, I’ve finished countless runs, collected everything, killed every boss, and didn’t see any of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instantly beautiful, fast and playable, Grid Legends provides the perfect counterpoint to serious sim racing. It is very clearly similar to 2019’s Grid reboot, although there is immediately one thing that’s changed that makes this offering worth the upgrade. No, not the added story mode, it’s more fundamental than that; it’s the handling. It just didn’t feel quite right in the last game, whereas here it’s arguably the most playable handling system of any modern racer that doesn’t have ‘Kart’ in its title. Even though your car slides at every opportunity, it’s actually disguising the fact there’s a great deal of grip here, making for an enjoyable experience whatever your skill level.

While this is probably more notable to console players buying the game on a 'disc' (some sort of tangible version of Spotify, I think?), perhaps you might be interested to see what's changed since the version of the game reviewers reviewed? You know, all those glowing, effusive reviews, who evidently weren't super-bothered by these issues. But it's good to know.

But before it was on the front page of Steam and selling like hotcakes, it was a Half Life 2 mod cooked up by designer and writer Dan Pinchbeck and a group of friends. “I was doing a PhD, weirdly, on first person shooters,” Pinchbeck says. As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”

But first this week there's some big Henry "Vitamin H" Cavill news to get out of the way, plus we discuss drinking animal blood in VIP sections (which is what rich people do), and at what point it stops being cool to go to a nightclub. For me? Almost immediately. And me and Matthew have actually been playing a game, but it's a PlayStation game so please don't listen to us talk about it. But you should definitely listen to Matthew's Hitman-themed Cavern Of Lies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the game where you peel a dead woman’s face off. You do it slowly, with a blunt dog tag, making several raggedy incisions before tearing off the face proper. After lingering over the resulting mess of blood, muscle and bulging eyes, you then place your recently drowned identical twin sister’s face over your own. It’s just a dream, but still, this is far from the only time Martha Is Dead insists you do something unspeakable, nor is it even the only time you’re forced to desecrate your sister’s corpse. 


Apart from poor writing, these excessive, brute force attempts to disturb define Martha Is Dead. They suck. Horror games are allowed to be horrific, but the way to cultivate real fear is through restraint rather than desensitising bombardment. For the most part Martha just made me frown and go “ew”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of games purport to feel like playable cartoons, but I really do mean it when I say that Happy Juice Games' delightful point and click adventure Lost In Play feels like a playable cartoon. While the full game isn't due out until the summer, I can confirm that its 30-minute Steam Next Fest demo is an absolute joy from start to finish. If you're after a kid-friendly adventure in the vein of Röki but with an extra smidge of Professor Layton-style logic puzzles thrown in, this is the Next Fest demo for you.

Sadly, players are still reporting problems, including some that I dodged - like invisible enemies. Oh dear! There are a few possible fixes you can try, though, and I'll keep this guide updated should more official improvements arrive. The original text continues below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a moment, pretend you're an examiner marking FromSoftware games. Get that red biro ready. "Tried jumping, didn't work", you might pop by Dark Souls. "Nothing but grief here", you mark by Bloodborne. "Time for crab", you scribble across each one in a mad frenzy. You are so tired of the crabs. They aren't the most encouraging games, to say the least.
But Elden Ring is different. Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's. An unmissable jaunt through one of, if not the most impressive open world to date. "Visions of joy" sums it up nicely.

The developers, Creative Assembly say they're working on fixing it. Yesterday they laid out their plans for improving performance, stability, and a few other issues, expecting to launch the first 'hotfix' patch this week. But some issues have many causes, so they warn it'll take time and multiple patches to really fix the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 was an infuriating mess in so many ways when I reviewed it at the end of 2020, but a funny thing would happen every time I'd stop playing it. All the T-posed NPCs, floataway physics bugs and crashes-to-desktop would be lost in time, like tears in rain. What remained was the deep appreciation I had for its story and characters, and a longing to revisit Night City.
So I have. After last week's patch 1.5 promised more fixes, a refreshed perk tree and improved AI, I wondered if I might finally be able to champion the first-person RPG without caveats. The answer is not a simple yes or no - but the list of caveats is definitely a lot shorter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2012, the late great Antony Bourdain tweeted an impassioned defence of a fellow food writer, then 85 year old Marilyn Hagerty, whose recent positive review of her local Olive Garden had become the subject of widespread memery. I’ve never eaten at an Olive Garden because a.) we don’t have them in the UK, and b.) unlimited pasta sounds like a death sentence. But I understand it’s viewed as a faux-fancy chain for people who think Al Dente was the name of the man who invented spaghetti, and not somewhere you’d want to earnestly praise as a quote unquote ‘serious critic’.


Big Tones was having none of it. He applauded Hagerty’s celebration of Olive Garden as a genuine expression of widespread American food culture, calling her detractors ‘snarkologists’, and then published a book of her reviews. A class act, no doubt. And it’s this championing of the everyman gourmand, this deep passion for non-exclusionary, unpretentious foodie culture, that powers Total War: Warhammer 3’s most joyfully silly campaign experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, I played Horizon Forbidden West on my big Sony box, a game I spent several hours in before reaching said titular region. I still appear to be untold miles away from the cool kind of jungley beachy bits from the promo screenshots. So far, though, I'm having a lot of fun, riding around on my big metal robot cow in its stunning world - a very beautiful game, is this, with lots of lens flare and dripping water and waving grass. A big and interesting world, and I am very much looking forward to playing more and reading insightful criticism and analysis of it. I would also like someone to explain the Pullcaster to me, because it's one thing in Horizon Forbidden West that, as far as I can tell, does not need to exist whatsoever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Elden Ring doesn't launch for another few days, the launch trailer launched today. Like many people, I'm trying to avoid the new grim adventure from the makers of Dark Souls as much as possible, because I want to go in innocent, wide-eyed, full of surprise, and wholly unwarned of the many deaths awaiting me. So I'll share the launch trailer with you but I won't watch it myself. Even the game's marketing team warn that it shows things we've not seen before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Souls begins by creating the universe. “In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog,” intones the opening cinematic. “A land of gray crags, archtrees and everlasting dragons.” Those two sentences do a lot of heavy lifting. “We needed to conjure an image of the world in its previous static state, where concepts that we take for granted - the finite nature of life and all conceptual contrasts - were nonexistent,” says Ryan Morris, lead translator at Frognation, the Tokyo and London-based consultancy that has handled the majority of From's Souls or Souls-type projects, from the original Demon's Souls to this year's Elden Ring. “I think of the singularity that existed before the Big Bang.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Broken Rules announced their colourful 2D swingathon Gibbon: Beyond The Trees at the beginning of February, I was immediately on board. Finally, I could live out my dream of sliding down tree branches like Disney's Tarzan, all while playing another gorgeous adventure from the makers of Old Man's Journey and Secrets Of Raetikon. Admittedly, I was surprised when I saw it was going to be part of this week's Steam Next Fest. The developers have said upfront that the game is only around an hour long, and with this week's demo stretching to a generous 20 minutes, part of me's now quite sad that I've already seen a third of it in action. 
The other part of me, however, is absolutely thrilled, and it's all down to my gibbon's sick, speed-boosting backflips.

While the console versions will have staggered launches around the world at midnight local time (mostly), on PC it's a simultaneous global launch. Depending on where you live, this could mean you get to start playing on PC hours before your consolable chums—or you could be waiting hours. Preloading is due to start tonight, too.

But rather than shrug and instantly release a sequel, for once Ubisoft kept working on the multiplayer tactical FPS with updates and overhauls, and today it boasts PC player numbers four times higher than launch. Over the weekend, Ubisoft laid out their plans for Year 7 of content updates, including brand new maps for the first time in years.
