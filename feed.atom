        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Faction Wars.
Despite releasing just a year after its predecessor, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky makes significant changes to the formula of GSC Game World’s venerable series. There are tweaked visuals, improved shooting, and some added systems crammed into this prequel. As a result, it feels markedly different to Shadow of Chornobyl, but not always in a good way. The shift in focus to faction conflict de-emphasises the persistent atmosphere of dread that permeated the first game.
You fill the irradiated boots of Scar, a Stalker with a mysterious condition that allows him to survive the Zone's emissions. Rescued from such an event by research group Clear Sky, he is tasked with tracking down a group of Stalkers as a means of repayment. These rogue mercenaries have designs on reaching the secrets at the centre of the Zone… and one of their number is our old friend Strelok.

War of the Gnomes

Back in the original Chapter 2, eagle-eyed players noticed certain props moving around the island between updates. Through the chapter, a story was told about a confrontation between the Lawn Gnomes and the Teddy Bears. Unlike most games, however, it wasn't told through cinematics or audio logs. It was told through the incremental changes made to props between updates.


Eventually, the war was won by the Teddy Bears, and the Gnomes were exiled from the island. However, they've been periodicall…]]></summary>

As a part of its recent Corporate Management Policy Briefing for FY2025, Nintendo has reiterated its stance on mergers and acquisitions. Namely, while future acquisitions are never off the table, it would rather "organically expand the organisation".
This, the briefing note claimed, is so that new staff members to Nintendo can "fully learn and understand our creative culture" — as opposed to splitting things across too many studios, we'd imagine.

Last month's excellent 'Ode to Castlevania' DLC has got us diving into Poncle's beautiful bullet hell, Vampire Survivors, all over again. We've been having such a good time with the latest expansion that we'd be perfectly happy to see waves of DLC added to this one for years to come, but naturally, Poncle may one day want to move on to a new project. And yet, whatever comes next, it seems we shouldn't expect it to blow the current project's scope out of the water.
That is according to the game's creator, Luca Galante, who, in a recent interview with Metro, stated that he wouldn't want a follow-up game to "try and do something bigger just because it’s what everyone is expecting". Instead, Galante claims, he'd rather keep working at his own level: "It would have a higher budget," he told Metro, "but it wouldn’t be dramatically different in terms of scope, than Vampire Survivors".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main story quest in Brighter Shores will introduce you to the MMORPG's mechanics and professions while also taking you through all four of the game's zones. Starting in Hopeport, you'll join the Guard and eventually be attacked by enemies and forced to defend. One of your fellow guards, Delana, loses her Bow and asks you to find it for her. Here is where to find Delana's Bow for the Main Story quest in Brighter Shores.





Where you can find Delana's Bow


You can find Delana's Bow by heading into the Guard Barracks building located directly behind Delana, and then looking behind the light blue Bed on the north end of the Barracks. You'll see the Bow sticking up behind the bed which you can interact with to pick it up for Delana. Head back outside and talk to Delana and tell her you have found her bow, then hand it over to her.


Handing over Delana's Bow to her will complete this part of the Main Story quest and allow to continue forward with it. You'll then have to line up with your other fellow Guards before going out and defending the Town Square from the attacking enemies.


A good tip when doing quests like this where you need to find certain items that may be hidden or harder to see, is to use your Sense ability by clicking the Eye icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. When you use Sense, your character sends out a pulse that will highlight everything on the map you are currently on that can be used, interacted with, or picked up. This is a great way to find hard to see items and also to see which interactable spots are located on the map for you to use your various professions on.

When you first start a new game using the Meadowlands Farm, you’ll have a lot of Blue Grass around for your animals to munch on. However, it rapidly disappears as the animals get to eat, and you’ll eventually end up with not much left, or worse, none at all. 


There are some techniques to preserve Blue Grass, such as placing a fence post on top of a patch to prevent your animals from getting to it, but growth can be frustratingly slow. This is worsened in the winter, as Blue Grass doesn’t grow or spread during the season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you start to level up your character in Brighter Shores, Knowledge Points will have immense value to help you improve your character.


In Brighter Shores, there are plenty of professions, and they don't work like the typical class system in MMO. You don't get to pick one of them. Instead, all of them will be available at the same time, and you'll have to level them all up together. This is where the Knowledge Point system comes in, and it can help you level up things far more quickly.


How to get Knowledge Points in Brighter Shores


The process of getting a Knowledge Point is directly related to the level of your profession. Whenever you gain XP by taking part in an activity, you'll contribute to achieving a Knowledge Point. The progress can be seen from the Professions tab, which will show your current progress and the exact rewards that you'll receive.


Every form of activity that you undertake will help you increase your progress in gaining a Knowledge Point. It's unclear as of writing (since I have gained just one so far) if you can stack Knowledge Points or if you'll have to spend them immediately. If it's the latter, there are three ways to spend these valuable points in Brighter Shores.

How to use Knowledge Points in Brighter Shores


Knowledge Points can be used in three different ways.



Unlock Passive Activity


Increase XP of a specific profession


Sell for money



The recommended use is to unlock Passive Activity, which allows you to gain passive XP for a profession of your choice. You can also use a Knowledge Point to increase the Passive Activity level of a specific profession, which will unlock better rewards.


If you no longer have any Passive Activity to unlock, the Knowledge Points can be used to increase the XP for a profession to get new rewards as well. Make sure not to spend your points on getting money, as that's the least advisable way to spend this resource.

Fans are constantly wondering what features it's going to have and, fortunately, we just received confirmation about one of the biggest ones.




The president of Nintendo, Shuntaro Furukawa posted a special message on the company's corporate Twitter/X account, in which he let people know that he announced that the successor of the Nintendo Switch will be backwards compatible on Nintendo's newest Corporate Management Policy Briefing. But that's not all, because he also confirmed that the Nintendo Switch Online service will be available on the next console as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Zenless Zone Zero's 1.3 update, a new Special Agent quest was introduced. If you've started the quest and are seemingly unable to continue the story due to a sudden soft lock, I've got the solution that will fix your problem, though it is a bit unusual.


Zenless Zone Zero 1.3 Special Agent Story Soft Lock Workaround (Fix)


If you're playing Zenless Zone Zero on the PC client, you might encounter a point in the new Special Agent story where progress halts, leaving you stuck in Immersive Storytelling mode with no way to advance. You are also unable to move, thus softlocking you and preventing you from really doing anything else in the game. Normally, you'd have to wait for the developers to fix this sort of problem in this scenario. Although a fix is likely coming soon, there's a workaround you can use now to keep playing the rest of the update content.

To be clear, this problem only exists on the PC client, so if you're stuck, the solution is to load up Zenless Zone Zero through its mobile client. You can do this on any mobile device, though it may take a little time to download if it's not already installed. Once installed, open the game and attempt to continue the storyline on the device. Doing this should resolve the soft lock for you, allowing you to continue playing and progressing on the PC client. 


If this solution does not work for you, then I'm afraid you will have to wait for the developers to fix the problem and release a fix. Fortunately, HoYoverse, the developers behind Zenless Zone Zero, are quick to fix such disruptive problems and will also likely reward pull currency as compensation for your troubles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After what felt like a lifetime, console and mobile players finally received the long-awaited Stardew Valley 1.6 update a couple of days ago. Well, technically it's version 1.6.9 to account for the latest patch, but it comes with everything that came before it and that PC fans have been enjoying for months now.


However, there appears to be a small issue when it comes to performance. According to a recent post on X from developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone, there is a solution to those playing the latest version of Stardew Valley.




Until a more permanent fix can be sent out, Barone suggests anyone experiencing performance problems should "remove all hats from pets." No, this is apparently not a joke. Our own Paula kindly confirmed this to be a genuine piece of advice to the issue.


For real


If you're new to Stardew Valley and not sure what the advice entails, you're advised to "try putting a different hat on your pet," which will then "remove the original hat first." When pressed for further details in an excuse me, what? kind of way, the developer had this to say:



There's rumors of a strange rash affecting pets' ears in Zuzu City and we just want to make sure those ears can breath [sic] for a few days.




The 1.6.9 update went live a couple of days ago, bringing with it new features and changes. According to the patch notes, the game now gives you the ability to "place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture," adds in new Easter eggs, balances some aspects, and...you know what, there's too much to list here. Best to read the changelog itself.


The mobile port of Stardew Valley also now comes loaded with a hidden and experimental multiplayer feature. Instructions on how you can access it can be found here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forager is one of the several professions available in Brighter Shores, and unlocking it is relatively easy.


In fact, the unlock condition is directly part of the main quest, and hence, you can't miss it by any chance. If you're strictly sticking with the main quest, this will be the second profession you'll unlock. The process begins after you've enlisted as a guard and cleared the tutorial, so read to know what you exactly need to do.


How to become a Forager in Brighter Shores


Becoming a Forager is easy - just pick a resource from off the ground. When you're starting out, this is tricky. Most of the decisions you make are strictly based on the main quest.



Clear out the first couple of goblins.


Help out the civilian to carry his goods safely.


Return to your captain, and you'll find that one of your fellow guards is gravely injured.


Go to the Apocethary, and you'll be tasked with finding Brown Kelp.


This item will require you to travel all the way to the docks.


You'll pass through four different regions, but you can't get lost because all paths that aren't required will be locked.


Go to the coast and pick up some of the Kelp lying around. You'll find three ores to pick up and get all of them.


Picking the first one will automatically unlock the Forager profession for you in Brighter Shores.

You can also unlock the Fisherman profession along the way. This can be done from the Eel Bridge location, and you'll have to travel over the spot to complete the quest. If you're still confused as to how to do it, make sure to check this guide out.


If you've already unlocked the Fisherman profession, this guide will help you out with the correct locations where you will be able to find the fish to catch. Once you've unlocked a profession, make sure to complete tasks that will help you level up your profession and gain Knowledge Points along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brighter Shores is available worldwide, and you can enjoy different professions inside the game.


Professions act differently in this title, as you can't pick them during character creation. In fact, you'll always start as a Guard as part of the tutorial. But the game ensures that you're not forced to grind a single profession aimlessly, and being a fisherman inside the game can be pretty fun. But first, you must unlock it, and doing so will require you to emphasize your investigative skills.


How to become a Fisherman in Brighter Shores


Fisherman is the second profession you get to unlock in Brighter Shores. Naturally, it can be unlocked pretty early, but this profession isn't a part of the main quest. Hence, it's pretty easy to miss as you run around the map finding vital resources.



Complete the tutorial for the goblin attack to take place.


Fend off the initial batch of goblins and help out a civilian to ferry his goods to a cart in the Town Square.


Once you return, you'll find that one of your allies has been gravely wounded in the battle.


You'll have to head out to find Brown Kelp to save their life.


Go north from the Town Square, and you'll come across the Eel Street Bridge. You'll have to cross the bridge, and two goblins will be waiting for you.


Once you defeat the goblins, look down below the bridge.


A fish will be highlighted in bright blue.


Click on it, and you'll unlock the Fisherman profession.

Becoming a Fisherman in Brighter Shores will allow you to fish in suitable spots. However, you can't do that immediately, as you won't have the necessary equipment. To catch fish, you'll need a fishing rod. Make sure to check out our fishing guide if you want to become an expert angler and catch fish whenever you want.

Nintendo has released its Q&A transcription for the recent financial briefing, and it contains a rather humorous interaction between an investor and legendary creator Shigeru Miyamoto in which the former calls Miyamoto a "genius". To his face.
Naturally, given Miyamoto's tendency to view his accomplishments with a humble attitude, he was quick to dispute such a lofty label. Although the Google translation for the Q&A may be a bit iffy (an officially translation will likely land later this week), he essentially notes how employees who listen to his annual company lecture are surprised at how "normal" he really is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baví vás elektronika, informační technologie, bastlení nebo obecně technika? Pak i tento měsíc je tady pro Vás Virtuální Bastlírna - online setkání hospodského typu všech nadšenců do techniky, organizované projektem MacGyver strahovského studentského klubu SiliconHill.

Pokud by se diskuze náhodou zadrhla, mají Strahováci nachystaná i výplňová témata. Například co se stalo za katastrofy poslední měsíc? Voyager 1 musel kvůli poruše přejít z rychlé komunikace na pásmu X na pomalejší pásmo S. A na neocenitelný WebArchive šlo několik kybernetických útoků, které způsobily nejen výpadek ukládání nových stránek, ale i jeho kompletní nedostupnost.

Ale dost o katastrofách - co za nové projekty se vynořilo? Objevil se nový projekt kompletně 3D tištěného počítače Ondra. Také se našel šikula, který byl schopný rozebrat komunikaci s levnou čínskou termokamerou a získat tak mnohem lepší obrázky. A firma Mosaic uveřejnila patnáctiterapixelový soubor 3D scanů a 360 stupňových obrázků Prahy.

Z kuriozit se pak nabízí modifikace chytrých baterií firmy Parkside pro kompatibilitu se sítí FindMyIphone, Linux nabootovaný na procesoru Intel 4004 (s malým trikem) a nebo výroba největšího digitronu na světě (v České republice)! 

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 7. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

There's no doubt that the Nintendo Switch has seen its fair share of success in Japan, North America and Europe, but is it really a worldwide phenomenon? As it turns out, yes, it is.
As revealed in Nintendo's latest financial report, the company's recent efforts to expand into "growing markets" — mainly defined as Asia and Oceana, but basically all regions outside Japan, North America and Europe — have produced positive results for Switch sales, with purchased hardware numbers increasing 6.4-fold when compared to 2017 in these regions.

Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. "[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets," said creator Eric Barone in a xeet.

Nintendo is home to a smorgasbord of incredible evergreen franchises, though its safe to say that its often relied heavily upon the likes of Super Mario, Zelda, and Pokémon for those big sales figures.
According to the company's latest financial briefing, however, some of its more niche franchises have reportedly seen "dramatic sales growth" on Nintendo Switch. Specifically, the four IP highlighted are Metroid, Xenoblade Chronicles, Kirby, and Pikmin.

There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.
You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

There are dozens of Star Wars games, and weeding out the best of them is difficult. Historically, LucasArts' and now Lucasfilm Games' oversight has ensured that developers and publishers put time and effort into crafting enjoyable Star Wars titles that don't tarnish the IP's reputation. 


All the games on this list are some of the best pieces of Star Wars merchandise out there, and I can safely recommend every single one to Star Wars fans. However, not all stars gleam with the same brightness, and there are games on this list that outshine their competition. Here are the ten best Star Wars games of all time, ranked by a few humble fans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

A theoretical damages claim of more than a billion dollars, plus an allegation of wiretapping, makes this case a little more spicy than most.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: "yup, it's COD", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discourse? Look mate, I’m just here to test the Steam Deck. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Zone.
Lauded on its original 2007 release, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow Of Chornobyl dropped players into a stark world, filled with effective horror and precision combat. It spawned two sequels, both of which refined and improved on the model of their predecessor. Ukraine-based GSC Game World’s Legends Of The Zone bundle squeezes all three expansive adventures onto Switch with modern optimisations and stable visual performance, although each title is also available as a standalone purchase. It’s worth noting that this is the series' first time on consoles (with the PlayStation versions released back in March), which makes the competency of these ports all the more impressive.
Taking inspiration from the 1971 Russian novel Roadside Picnic, Shadows Of Chornobyl is set in the irradiated wilderness of the Zone. Decades after repopulation efforts, a second Chornobyl disaster occurs, turning residents into mutated creatures and littering the countryside with deadly elemental anomalies. The haunting and oppressive atmosphere of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film adaptation Stalker, is prevalent throughout. The Zone always feels like an alien landscape, or a bad dream.

It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.

With the release of Nintendo's financial report for Q2 FY2025, we have updated sales figures for some of the year's biggest Switch titles. And what do you know, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has hit a pretty impressive milestone.
At the latest count (up to September 2024), the Switch remake has pulled in 1.94 million sales since its release in May. It's a decent number (if not a particularly high one by Nintendo's standards), but what makes this figure so special is that it's higher than TTYD's lifetime sales on GameCube — which sales-tracking website VGChartz puts at 1.91 million. Yes, after just four months, the remake has outsold the original.

They get to analyse and discover cool artefacts and educate us on the histories of forgotten civilisations. That's dreamy stuff, that is. But I do wonder what it's like for archaeologists to discover and study something they shouldn't have; something with a disturbing secret - a curse, maybe. Bite-sized horror game The Children Of Clay explores this idea and I'd like more of it, please.

The latest UK charts are in and after putting up an admirable performance in its debut week, Sonic X Shadow Generations appears to be struggling over a long distance.
The blue blur's latest adventure has slipped out of the top ten this week, winding up in 13th while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and EA Sports FC 25 both cling onto the gold and silver. Dragon Age: The Veilguard debuts in third, but it's a slightly quiet one on the Nintendo front.

Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.
Fortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn's dead-eyed appraisal that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

Nintendo has announced that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has sold a total of 2.58 million units since its release on 26th September 2024.
Now, officially, the financial data covers the first six-month period of FY2025 ending on September 30th 2024. Nintendo has played a bit fast and loose when it comes to announcing sales for new titles, so it's not known at this time whether the figures for Echoes of Wisdom just cover the six days between its release and the end of the six-month period, or if Nintendo has simply pulled the most recent data available.

For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch have introduced a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s tempting to frame Straftat as a throwback to an older, better time for the multiplayer FPS, when the lingo was coded in frags and gibs and sucking it down, when satisfaction was drawn entirely from performance rather than some convoluted, artificial system of progression. Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter launched into early access in September it was somewhat messy. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It's not as bad as it sounds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited for Slitterhead, an action adventure game by Bokeh Studio, a studio founded by none other than your boy Keiichiro Toyama: the creator of Silent Hill, Gravity Rush, and the Siren series. And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, "Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!"
No, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.

Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there's a good reason for those misgivings. It's all about frames, you see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my lesser quality tests for an RPG is whether the shopkeepers complain at you for not buying anything. Grumpy shopkeepers, good RPG. This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler Thysiastery, it turns out. This “dungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay” apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants. You’d be a monster for it, of course, but it’s nice to have options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your hand up if you'd forgotten that every Assassin's Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3.

That means it falls to me to round up (mostly) good (mostly) writing about (mostly) video games. I will otherwise be spending my Sunday continuing the fight against my dog's fleas, which rebound every three weeks no matter how much I spray, scrub or throw things away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some extremely fresh vintage workwear that I bought for entirely practical reasons aside, I’m not exactly a fashion person. I have nobody to impress most days but my cat, and the only item of clothing she appears to have an opinion on is my Oodie, which is very comfortable for both of us and also smells like a chicken shop, which I imagine is more pleasant for her than me.
This aside, I found myself taking a whole bunch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard screenshots as I played just to capture the RPG’s various outfits. They are ridiculous. Incredibly intricate and detailed, as well as being obscenely impractical for the most part. I do not like any of them in the sense I would wear them, but I like all of them in the sense that they display artists allowed to run free like caffeinated weasels and indulge their every whim.

Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for Apex Legends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of Dragon Age: Veilguard. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’. Here’s a clip:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy RPG studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter Prey (2017) studio Arkane Austin - alongside a handful of others - back in May.
Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form Weird West studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for PC Gamer about Arkane’s closure, saying:
I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.

With over a quarter billion visits in the last 12 months alone, Livehd7 is a significant operation, but  news of its demise may provoke déjà vu. In September 2023, ACE said that in collaboration with Egypt's Ministry of Justice, the operator of Livehd7 had been arrested, and the network shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.

I never finished it because my Xbox 360 version was not, in practice, an open world game, but a lonely farm at the bottom of a vortex of butchered spacetime. In the prologue, reformed outlaw John Marston confronts an old bandit acquaintance and gets himself roundly shot to bits. He’s rescued by local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane, who nurses him back to health and gives him a few odd jobs to warm him up for the next plot point.

They teach us to see 1-1 divine intervention in every random house fire and every lightning bolt that miraculously strikes our enemies. By contrast, the forthcoming Zero Orders Tactics teaches that god prefers to operate via covert means, because after all, personally lobbing some electricity at somebody would be inelegant. It's far more graceful to trap them behind a mountain, instead.

Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am once again asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you Ian Games for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy can be thin, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. "Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: "Nazis? I hate these guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.
I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.

To be honest with you, it looks more inspired by Rainbow Six Siege with what looks to be one team aiming to hack a crypt by breaking down defences, while the other reinforces structures to prevent them from doing that. There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting! If a difficult sell, given the fact it's yet another 5vs5 shooter…

I've already written our review for Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, in which I celebrated the touching moments of Max's return to the series, and lamented the clunky plot that she finds herself in. In this adventure game, you're looking into the killing of a close friend, shot by an unknown assailant. You hop between two dimensions to solve the case - one world in which your pal still lives and the other in which she's dead. Unfortunately for the murder victim, you play a bona fide hot mess who could not perform a cross examination if she were standing in front of a crucifix with a magnifying glass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into "Adventure Points", used to "unlock" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets. Sometimes, Indy's magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game's religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia. Sometimes, they exhaust you: please, Dr Jones, for the love of George. Stop trying to pick things up. Let me look at "ancient history" for a while.

To celebrate, they've also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

They're being supported by the Communication Workers Of America union, who claim that Activision are forcing the return to the office on staff "with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie have been fairly quiet about Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter they announced in 2023. Yesterday they released a devlog in which game director Joe Ziegler seemed to want to reassure fans of the studio that the game was still in development. He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.

A DMCA subpoena obtained earlier against Cloudflare appears to have provided plenty of fresh leads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Remains Of Edith Finch is a very upsetting collection of interactive short stories about the brief, tragic lives of a cursed family who live in a monstrous treehouse. It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.

Unfortunately for Bl6ps, and for us, that technical success is balanced on the knife tip of some seriously overwrought infrastructure. Mainly in the form the UX nightmare that is the Call of Duty HQ launcher, as well as a meddlesome always-online requirement, itself serving a feature that doesn’t even work that well.

But the word "ambivalent" already exists. So let's say I'm ambivalent about this new adventure featuring Max Caulfield, the returning hero of Life Is Strange, and time-travelling photographer whose powers have resurfaced after years of off-screen atrophy. I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".
When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.

The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget horror.

Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.
So, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn't only a product of its time - it's actually downright yucky.

The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

For you, there's a new free update, which adds a second set of themed card art to the game inspired by the games Binding Of Isaac, Cyberpunk 2077, Stardew Valley and Slay The Spire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windblown looks rad. It's an action-roguelite for 1-3 players in which you dash-and-slash in rapid combat on floating islands, and I am extremely interested in feeling its game-feel for myself. Good news! I can get my game-feelers on it now because it's out in Early Access today.

If you watch its launch trailer below out of context however, you might be fooled into thinking it's actually the emo second half of an Isekai anime series.

He's got assault rifles and comparison screenshots poking out of his ribcage, which are making an absolute mess of the hallway plaster. He says he is Call Of Duty Man, and he is here to let me know about Black Ops 6's day one patch. The new Activision FPS is out tomorrow 25th October, I gather. Call Of Duty Man speaks only in three-syllable bursts and rolling bombardments, but I think if I listen carefully I can make out the highlights. Here's what that patch involves, in nickel-plated bulletpoint form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zotac are one of the better graphics card makers of the post-EVGA era, so even as the early pangs of handheld gaming PC fatigue start to creep in, I’ve been keeping a hopeful eye on the Zotac Zone. This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Polish studio From Chaos consist of former members of Witcher developers CD Projekt Red, Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios and 4X household Paradox Interactive, led by erstwhile Gwent programmer Tomek Dietrich - so it's no huge surprise that their debut game, Liegecraft, is a big beardy historical strategy RPG.
It's a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft Montpellier's Beyond Good And Evil 2 has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of "vapourware", while staunchly refusing to become "abandonware". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children?

Turns out upping the spawn rate of the vicious Tyrannid baddies across all difficulty modes was not welcome among the meathead murder boys of the Imperium. And this change wasn't the only one that caused enough ructions to justify hasty recalibrations from Saber Interactive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Není to kvalitní film, ale je šílený a není nudný ani rutinní. Je to výpověď o tom, co si Coppola na stará kolena myslí o světě a o filmařině - a taková výpověď mě zajímá.

Kdyby mu bylo 10 nebo 12 let, už bych mu nepouštěl tohle, ale první Bayovy Transformers. Je to fajn, ale je to opravdu jen a pouze pro děti. A navíc, viděl jsem dabovanou verzi a rozhodně byla méně zábavná než tři minuty ukázek v původním znění, které jsem viděl taky. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
