Marvel, compared to the other titan of the comics industry, DC, likes to dabble in the bizarre. With Santa Claus himself being an omega-level mutant, it can't be that shocking that old gods like Dagon also share space among the various universes. However, it's surprising how few degrees of separation there are between Peter Paker and eldritch entities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years and years of waiting, fans are about to get their deepest look yet at the Dragon’s Dogma sequel. 


Capcom has just announced that a showcase for the game will be held on Tuesday, November 28, at 1PM PST. Fans can tune in for a 15-minute livestream that promises to reveal a ton of new info about the game while also showing off some never-before-seen gameplay. 




The original Dragon’s Dogma debuted all the way back in 2012, and fans have been dying for a sequel ever since. That’s not to say there hasn’t been other Dragon’s Dogma content in the past decade. Netflix released a one-season anime in 2020, and there have been two spinoff games: 2013’s Dragon’s Dogma Arisen and the Japanese exclusive Dragon’s Dogma Online. 


Capcom officially revealed that Dragon’s Dogma 2 was in the works as part of the original game’s 10th anniversary celebration, offering a first real look at the game in June 2023. Destructoid's own Timothy Monbleau got to spend some time hands-on with the game, calling Dragon's Dogma 2 "a game that just wants to be a good ol’ fun time over literally anything else, even if it means getting cheesy or silly." 


So far, it’s looked like Dragon’s Dogma 2 will offer even more of what we all loved about the original, and that would be a definite win. 


The biggest question looming over the upcoming showcase is the game's release date. Capcom hasn’t said anything about that yet, but with director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, this would be the perfect time to drop the news. We’ll just have to wait and see.

In Valve's new documentary celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Half-Life series, the company's co-founder Gabe Newell has shared his own thoughts about the differences between a delayed game and a rushed release.
He summed it up as "late is just for a little while, suck is forever" when touching on the challenges Valve faced in the lead-up to the release of Half-Life, which ultimately led to the game's release being pushed back a year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I mentioned this once before, but after the launch of the Super Nintendo in 1991 (1990 for Japan), Konami went through this weird period of producing licensed games that were way better than you’d expect. I’ve covered Bucky O’Hare, but there’s also Zen: The Intergalactic Ninja, and this one: Monster in My Pocket.


Monster in My Pocket is more than just a cheeky euphemism, it was this media franchise in the age when everyone wanted a media franchise. Well, it was an attempt at one. It was based around a series of tiny figures produced by Matchbox, but they also pushed a cartoon special and a comic that only made it through four issues. It was pretty short-lived.


The Monster in My Pocket NES game came out in 1992. Among the short list of staff who worked on the game is Etsunobu Ebisu, who…]]></summary>

So, I was excited to see when walkedoutneimans had a new game lined up. Okay, maybe “excited” isn’t the correct word. It’s more like morbidly curious. I really had to know if Suburban Basketball was just a one-off eruption of brilliant insanity or if the developer was intentionally trying to hurt us.


This time, we have Tyko’s Dying Together, another game growing parasitically on the backbone of GZDoom, and…

Valve has released the 25th anniversary update, which adds a staggering amount of changes and content to Half-Life including more multiplayer maps, modernized visual options, and the once-magazine exclusive Uplink campaign. 


The update is live now for owners of Half-Life, which likely counts for about 98% of all PC owners. And Valve has made sure nostalgia is set to hit you in the face like an unchecked crowbar right off the bat. The 25th anniversary update brings back the old-school Valve logo to Half-Life, along with the classic menu. This is probably the best way to relive that iconic 'monorail' opener.

In addition, the studio has released an update to the original “featuring quality of life fixes, restored content, and new multiplayer maps.” 




The documentary, released via Valve’s official YouTube channel, is over an hour in length and covers the studio's earliest days, the process of creating Half-Life’s opening levels, and other avenues of production like weapon, sound, and level design. Perhaps more notably the documentary reunites the team who worked on Half-Life, including co-founders Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big things are in store for twin-stick actioner Rusted Moss, which confirmed console plans and a major update promising seven to eight hours of new content.


The grapple-happy Metroidvania from developers faxdoc, happysquared, and sunnydaze originally hit PC on April 12, 2023. Next up for the game is a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in spring 2024. The team has been working on a big chunk of content that was originally planned for sometime in Q4 2023, but it's being pushed back to coincide with the console launch due to "development and porting adjustments." 


The update will launch on Steam around that time and will be available in the console versions along with all other previously-released updates. As for what the update entails, there are two new areas, over 300 new rooms, and a Boss Rush Mode. There's also a Maya Mode, which lets you play through as Maya for a taste of a new play style. Speedrun mode rules apply there, so just don't expect any new dialogue additions or endings. 


A short teaser was released along with the announcement to show off a tiny slice of new footage:




The footage may be brief, but it definitely sounds like there's a lot for players to look forward to when the update launches. "As you can see, we have probably enjoyed making this update a little too much," the devs said in the announcement. The additional time will give them a chance to finalize code and QA test for consoles, so a little more patience should pay out nicely.

I’ve certainly dipped my toes into this conversation before, including here on Destructoid. But for the recent release of Super Mario RPG, those asking “how long is it” may need a slightly more nuanced answer than usual.


For those just tuning in, the remake of the Super Nintendo classic Super Mario RPG is here. For my part, I absolutely loved reviewing the game. I do think there were missed opportunities with the remake. However, I remain confident in saying that everyone, in one way or another, should experience this adventure. It’s also a $60 remake of a 27-year-old game, and it doesn’t boast the longest run time.


Depending on where you look, you'll maybe see the claim that Super Mario RPG takes 12 hours…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mazes and labyrinths can be confusing, frustrating, oppressive, nightmarish. They are the kinds of structures videogame developers are reluctant to put in their games, because the potential for the player losing heart or patience is relatively high. But as productions, they can be strangely economical, oddly light-footed. Mazes and labyrinths, after all, twist up space and as such, discover or create additional space within space. They allow vast journeys to happen within areas that are modest when judged in terms of square footage, journeys that encompass a multitude of locations that have an inherent, automatic atmosphere: tantalising forks in the path and mocking dead ends, hubs with corridors leading in all directions, leisurely perimeter paths and gristly knots of inner passages.
As such, I think they're useful to reflect on at a time when the mantra of growth for its own sake has conquered the heart of videogame world design: bigger budgets for grander maps in terms of both explorable area and computational resource, all the way to Armageddon (did you know that Suicide Squad's Metropolis is twice the size of Arkham Knight's Gotham City?). But don't take it from me, an armchair developer with armchair socialist sensibilities. Take it from The Legend of Zelda.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the lead-up to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Square Enix has shared a recap of the original game’s story, set from the perspective of Red XIII. The recap comes as both Square Enix and fans are counting down the days until Rebirth's release on February 29, 2024.




The recap starts with a description of Midgar and the ShinRa Electric Power Company, set to a chilling rendition of Sephiroth’s theme. As Cloud, Barret and other members of Avalanche are introduced, the music starts to become more hopeful as Cloud meets Aerith following the Sector 8 reactor explosion. It quickly returns to the haunting choral melody as President Shinra and his employees are introduced.


To be honest, the recap does an excellent job of covering the basic plot points from Final Fantasy 7 Remake, though it does bypass the events of the Sector 6 slums, the Wall Market, Don Corneo’s Mansion, and everything else between meeting Aerith and the attack on Sector 7. It also doesn’t mention Zack’s inexplicable revival, which is interesting, given how important he seems to be in Rebirth.


I must admit, though, seeing the fight against Sephiroth at the end of Remake again reminded me of how silly that final act was. Here’s hoping they’re able to make that fight and its ramifications make sense in Rebirth. It’s already been confirmed by Tetsuya Nomura that Rebirth will extend up to The Forgotten Capital, so things are already looking up in that regard. 


Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches exclusively for the PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.

Three new 6v6 maps are going to be joining the rotation specifically in MW3 Season 1. The first two, Meat and Greece, will be available on day one of the Season. Meat is a compact map centered around a slaughterhouse. Greece on the other hand is a medium-sized Mediterranean-inspired map in a coastal town. A third map, Rio, will be released later in the season.

We didn't really know what to make of KarmaZoo when it was first revealed in this year's Wholesome Direct. The co-op platformer from Devolver Digital and Pastagames looked sweet, for sure, but pretty pixel-art platforming is hardly a rare species in the jungle that is the Switch eShop. What was going to be the hook to separate this one from the rest of the pack? The answer: Sharing the love.
Of course, helping your teammates get to the goal should be the objective of any team-based platforming (we say, as our mind furiously flashes back to memories of being thrown off cliffs in New Super Mario Bros. U), but Karmazoo takes things up to another level where helping your teammates — and racking up some good karma in the process — is the name of the game.

Earlier this year, it was reported that disgruntled fans had filed a class action lawsuit against developer Aspyr after the latter announced it would be cancelling the 'Restored Content' DLC for STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords on Switch.
According to a new article from Axios, Aspyr is seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed on the basis that the plaintiffs in question had already been offered relief in the form of a free game. In fact, new court filings reveal that the primary plaintiff, Malachi Mickelonis, who had previously stated that he "felt completely duped" by Aspyr, had requested and subsequently received a code for one of the free games on offer.

The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,  from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I think this is probably the first and only time I've ever heard British documentarian Adam Curtis appear as an ominous backing sample in an RPG boss battle theme, but in many ways, I hope it's not the last. Forget the operatic choral chants of Final Fantasy bosses. The new rallying cry against peak villainy is now some no-nonsense British commentary about the state of human extinction. It works surprisingly, well, and Small Saga is a game shot through with these kinds of Britishisms, set in the parks, streets and underbelly of modern-day London. 
Only this isn't an RPG about humans, but the rodents that live beneath their feet - the mice, rats, squirrels and moles who have developed a kind of proto-medieval society of their own built from the trash and discarded objects they've scavenged from under our noses. In this world, humans are terrifying 'gods', supermarkets with their shelves of seeds and grain are called 'Heaven', and your main mode of transportation is a pigeon with a wicker basket. It's a fascinating world solo developer Darya Noghani has created here, and it would be a thrilling turn-based RPG, too - if only its battles didn't completely cheese it when it comes to providing any sense of challenge.

Motesolo: No Girlfriend Since Birth was developed by Indicava Interactive, and as the name suggests, it follows the story of a man named Kimo Kang who's about to turn 30 and wants to finally find a romantic partner. This is no easy feat, as he's awkward, nervous, and unintentionally idiosyncratic. It arrives on November 30 on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

Unique and full of heart


Motesolo was originally released in 2021, and it won the Indie Game Award at the Korea Game Awards. It currently sits with a "Very Positive" rating on Steam, but you should be aware of what you're getting yourself into. 


It is a movie game, meaning that the game plays out through live-action scenes. You do have some control, and the way the story pans out depends on your input. For instance, when you're in a cafe waiting for your blind date, you can interact with many things, and even gain some items or information that'll help you on your date. You'll also have to pick dialog options that hopefully lead to a happy ending. 


You can also interact with Kimo's cellphone where you're able to chat with his friends and watch videos that could potentially help you find romantic success. The story isn't entirely about Kimo, however. You also get to learn about his blind date, Yumi, who is willing to give Kimo a chance, but she'll have to deal with his occasionally cringe-inducing behavior. 




It's a funny, heartwarming game that is carried by the good performances and humorous plot. Give it a shot; you may be surprised at how good it is at putting a smile on your face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hitman: Blood Money was a big hit for the franchise when it was released for PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360 back in 2006. Now, a new set of players can experience the classic stealth title as heads to iOS and Android at the end of November as Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal.


Feral Interactive, the same studio that brought us a slew of AAA titles to mobile, is back at it again. The developer dropped a trailer for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal that shows exactly what iOS and Android users should expect when the game releases on November 30.




The game's visuals remain on par with its PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 predecessors. But the stealth game's interface has been completely reworked to suit mobile devices. There have also been a few new bells and whistles included for a better overall experience.


Instinct Mode is something that's being brought to Reprisal from later games in the series. It highlights targets and critical mission points to make navigating maps a bit easier. 


A mini-map is also being introduced to Blood Money for the first time. It offers better feedback on Agent 47's surroundings, including alerts if the character is raising suspicions. As in the original, there are 12 sandbox missions for players to enjoy over and over again due to their highly replayable nature.


Controls for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal have been reworked, too so that users can create a UI that fits them best on the go. However, those who wish to utilize a gamepad or keyboard and mouse have that option too. 


Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal sneaks up on iOS and Android users on November 30. It's listed in the App Store and Google Play Store for $14.99. A Nintendo Switch port is also planned for some point in the winter.

During this year's Toyko Game Show festivities, Takaya Imamura - best known for his work on the F-Zero and Star Fox franchises - showcased the first trailer for his upcoming title, Omega 6: The Video Game.
The game is based on a manga created by Imamura and will feature text-based adventure mechanics alongside turn-based combat. It's difficult to imagine such a concept taking inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but according to Automaton, that's exactly what the development team, Happymeal, is intending.

Nobody must know! Oh drat. Anyway, despite my lack of expertise, the Supergiant action-roguelite was the first comparison that came to mind while watching the trailer for Realm of Ink, which has just been announced.


It makes use of a similar angled perspective, appears similarly focussed on build customisation, with hundreds of magic items to equip, and sees you playing out the backstories of various mythological personalities - derived, in this case, not from Ancient Greece but China and Buddhism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 
The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 


Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.]]></summary>

Players were upset with the change, which arrived out of nowhere, as it made skins they previously used on various creative islands unusable on said islands due to the new age rating restriction. Developer Epic Games has now responded, revealing that about 7% of Fortnite skins, or Outfits as they're officially called, can only be equipped in islands rated Teen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reader, I have a confession to make. I have tried long and hard to like adorable citybuilder Townscaper, but I just cannot muster much affection for it. I love how it looks, I love what it does, and I will endlessly admire how its little multi-coloured building bricks morph and shift, smooshed together in far more creative ways than I could ever manage myself. But when presented with a blank canvas and no direction on what to do with said multi-coloured building bricks, my mind seizes up and straight up refuses to extract any joy from it. It's a feeling I fear will apply to the equally charming Tiny Glade when that eventually comes out as well, based on the very lovely GIFs I've seen of it so far, and honestly, there are times when I worry my brain is just a teeny bit broken and I have lost the ability to find joy in what are clearly very joyful little creations.
But then I play games like Pile Up!, a micro citybuilder that's very much in the same vein as Townscaper, and realise, oh no, I do just need some objectives and structure to my game playing for everything to be fine again.

Games like The Last of Us have become generation-defining titles, and with every release, he continues to push the limits of cinematic gameplay and storytelling. 


His career trajectory has also been an impressive one. As the president and founder of the New York Video Game Critics Circle Harold Goldberg explains, Druckmann "worked his way from an internship all the way up to being a co-president at Naughty Dog."

This goes doubly so now that SteamOS 3.5.5 has officially come out, allowing you to tune your colour vibrancy and more.


Indeed, no longer do you need to rely on third-party plugins to tweak your Steam Deck's display: the long-awaited SteamOS update 3.5 is now available for download, and it includes some big must-have features for the older model of the device. Do expect some performance and stability improvements, of course, but the biggest draw here is absolutely the new colour settings interface, where you're free to customize the Deck's display image output however you wish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every Switch game on sale that we gave 9/10.
It's time for this year's Black Friday sales, and Nintendo's European Switch eShops are getting in early on them this year with a large selection of discounted games that will be added to before the sale ends on 3rd December 2023.
However, with so many games discounted — a colossal 2,717 according to our eShop at the time of writing! (although not all those are part of this specific sale) — it can be hard to know where to start. Our wishlists are overflowing as it is, so below we've rounded up every game in the Nintendo's European Black Friday sale that we've awarded 9/10 or higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Dragon Age: Dreadwolf production director and veteran Mass Effect scribe Mac Walters has founded a new studio, Worlds Untold, with funding from NetEase. According to the official site, the studio will develop "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding": its first project is a single-player-focussed, "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". 


Amongst other things, this reflects Walter's desire to move away from the "space opera" RPGs he's made in the past and develop a more linear, story-driven sci-fi game, whose universe might also host TV or novel adaptations. Which might not sound very appealing to BioWare diehards, but you can rest easy on one count: the game will have plenty of lore, though how it's served up to the player is another question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In terms of straight-up savings, the best early Black Friday gaming laptop deals are surely the most generous among pre-Christmas games tech discounts. True, they’re pricier than any gaming mouse or Steam Deck accessory to begin with, but basic principles of proportions mean that the choicest deals will lop off enormous wads of cash.
And these are quality lappies, too. Some of my personal favourites (the Gigabyte Aorus 15X! The Razer Blade 14! The Acer Nitro 5, if you’re on a budget!) have made into Black Friday’s early deal highlights, and there are plenty more besides. Most of them are rocking up-to-date Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs, too, so they’ll be able to handle ray tracing and roid their own performance via DLSS 3. To varying extents, naturally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reports suggested Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was a crunch-driven 16 month project, and our campaign review thought it displayed characteristics of a rushed schedule-filler. Besides quality gunplay and a fantastic array of classic maps, MW3's multiplayer doesn't do much to differentiate itself from MW2, aside from being more of a frustrating grind. And its awkwardly positioned zombies mode, though it might appeal to some, has been robbed of its sickle-sharpening soul. All of it does smack of being rushed, and I'd only recommend the game if you're an ardent fan of COD who's happy to accept little in the way of changes. Otherwise, this FPS simply isn't worth spending your hard-earned bucks on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander's release, I was still learning to spell and wrestling with the whole "going to the toilet independently" business, but if I'd had access to an MS-DOS PC between potty-training sessions, I dare say I'd have tried my hand at being an intergalactic warlord. Originally published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation and distributed by a little-known company called Electronic Arts, it's an absurdly in-depth and fiddly-looking space sim in which you fly around a randomly generated cosmos in your horrible Klingon-adjacent battlecruiser, blowing up or commandeering other ships, bombarding or invading planets, and generally speaking being a nuisance. 


According to its creators, Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, the game had a rushed launch that led to a lot of technical issues. The developers released another, relatively bug-free version in 1991, which is the version you'll find on most retro game preservation sites. Then, in 2018, Sorensen decided to make a new 2.0 version of Krellan Commander using his original 486 PC, which finally launched this week on Steam and GOG.

The news comes from PlayStation dataminer @PlayStationSize who posted a somewhat cryptic Tweet featuring the Naughty Dog sequel. Industry Insider's Tom Henderson contacted the account and confirmed that "the tweet refers to The Last of Us Part II as a native version being added to the PlayStation database."




 This seems to align with what game composer Gustavo Santaolalla previously hinted at in an interview with BLENDER. In the interview, he also claimed that in the PS5 version players would be able to interact with his character and make him play music.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward.

Culex appears in Super Mario RPG remake as he did in the original game, which is to say he is a pixelated, 2D creature. He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone. You then use that shiny stone in Monstro Town on the locked door.

Former Nintendo employee and 45-year-old video game artist Miura Koichi, who has previously worked on Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom as a landscape artist, recently provided some insight about his time at the famous Japanese company.
He describes Nintendo as a "wonderful" place but admits it was "hell" as an "average person". As highlighted by Automaton, Koichi's tell-all post has now gone viral online, generating 25 million views. Despite praising the company as a "haven for geniuses" and superhuman talent, he felt this "incredible" environment just wasn't for him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck OLED releases today, providing a new avenue for game players (especially those with big Steam libraries) to take their gaming experience on the go. The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.
Steam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price. However, several of the concerns that surfaced in that review have been remedied by the new model – enough that a new evaluation is warranted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios announced Baldur’s Gate 3 will finally be receiving a physical release for PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC in 2024. The physical release has been confirmed to be playable on-disc as a Deluxe Edition, which comes with a full, 3-disc soundtrack, a poster, and more.


The PlayStation 5 edition will contain 2 discs, while the Xbox Series X edition will contain 3 discs. PC, meanwhile, has a CD key and installer.




Included in the Deluxe Edition for Baldur’s Gate 3 is the aforementioned poster of a mind flayer, a set of 32 stickers featuring iconography from the game’s story, the original soundtrack from the game, a world map, two patches — one of the Absolute logo and one of the Flaming Fist logo — and the game itself, on your chosen platform. You'll also get all Digital Deluxe edition content, too.


If you’ve been tracking the release status of Baldur’s Gate 3 since its digital PC launch in August and its digital PS5 release a month later, you might be surprised to read it’s only just now making the leap to a physical edition. 


Until this announcement, the only way to get your hands on a physical copy of Baldur’s Gate 3 was in Japan. Spike Chunsoft, the developer of the Danganronpa series, was announced to be publishing the physical edition in Japan on December 21. But now, fans the world over can add the physical edition of this remarkable game to their libraries.


Pre-orders for the physical edition of Baldur’s Gate 3 are now open for all platforms. They are expected to ship in Q1 2024.

        <updated>2023-11-16T20:28:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As initially reported by IGN, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors commented during a financial presentation that he has no comment on the state of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. He also states, “Anything I say to this becomes a headline.” Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it will.


A remake of the classic 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was announced back in 2021 during a Playstation Showcase. Since then, we’ve received re-releases of the two games in the series, and then everything kind of hit the rocks. The re-releases didn’t go very smoothly, and the intention of adding restored cut content to the second game (which badly needs it) was canceled. 


In 2022, Bloomberg reported that the remake might have been put on hold. This was following the production of a demo – which reportedly didn’t go over very well – and the subsequent firing of the art and design director.


While Wingefors statement doesn’t really say anything, the fact that it says nothing is pretty telling. If production was chugging along on schedule, he probably would have been quick to tout its promising outlook. It also doesn’t clarify if the project is on indefinite hold or canceled outright. So, that leaves us to speculate.


I was pretty skeptical of the project, to begin with. Aspyr and Saber Interactive are capable studios, but they’re mostly known for porting existing games. A remake on this scale is pretty massive, so even if it saw the light of day, I’m not certain it would meet its ambition. Now, however, Embracer has been laying off massive amounts of people – reportedly 900 in a single financial quarter. I’m not saying it’s impossible for the Knights of the Old Republic remake to eventually see the light of day, but I’ll believe it when I see it.

This was before I knew the term “RPG” or even understood the scope of its sprawling open worlds. Countless playthroughs began and died as I fumbled through Cyrodiil, only to start over again.


That was around 2006, and I really began appreciating Oblivion when I played the 5th Anniversary Edition on PS3 some years after. Sure, I ran through it on PC eventually, but it sat in my library for ages, a childhood memory awaiting its chance to shine again.


Then I got my Steam Deck and reinstalled Oblivion as a bit of a joke. Its PC version doesn't offer official controller support, but I keep it installed everywhere else, so why not on my handheld? The idea of portable Oblivion began nagg…]]></summary>

And then, in a bit of a meta twist, we hung out with Humanity co-developer and publisher Enhance and discussed how we made our making-of documentary. Even cooler, we made a Game Informer level within Humanity – and you can play it now.
All this happened on the "HUMANITY Hub Community Stream," where myself (Blake) and Alex Van Aken discussed why we decided to make a documentary on Humanity, how we crafted the video, and even cutting-room floor content that didn't make the final product. We closed the show by putting our collective brains together to make a level based on the GI logo.
You can check out an archived version of the stream below:


By no means is our Humanity level an official partnership between Enhance and GI, but it's certainly a fun way to end a project that was a months-long labor of love. To play for yourself, either search via the name "GAME INFORMER FUN!" in the game's User Stages options or the stage ID: 013-020-5453.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 3D Realms published and Troglobytes Games developed The Kindeman Remedy has released today on PC. PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch versions will be released at a later date.


The Kindeman Remedy is a warped game about a disgraced doctor and morally bankrupt nun performing experiments on prisoners in an attempt to create a breakthrough treatment. It’s a pretty violent take on the medical management genre, as you torture and poison the inmates as you seek to restore the doctor’s reputation at any cost. You’re able to upgrade your facilities and manage resources as you perform your macabre work.




The whole horror-management mash-up genre has been growing lately, following the success of Graveyard Keeper and Ravenous Devils. Perhaps there’s some crossover between people who enjoy management games and misanthropes. A category that I fit neatly into.


I dig it. I would have liked to review this one if the season wasn’t so packed. Really, I’m waiting for someone to make something based on real-world serial killer H.H. Holmes and his Murder Castle. Only, hopefully, based less on reality because that whole tale is really screwed up. I just like the idea of the location also being the murder weapon.


The Kindeman Remedy is available today on PC via Steam. It will launch on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch eventually, but no release date has been set for those platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlus and Vanillaware have shared more details about Unicorn Overlord, the latter's new game with a strange name. But going off the screens and details we got today, it's worth looking beyond just the title.


Revealed during a Nintendo Direct earlier this year, Unicorn Overlord is the latest from Vanillaware, the studio behind games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, Odin Sphere, and GrimGrimoire. Its strategy roots are especially notable here, as Unicorn Overlord looks to be a mix of fantasy tactics and strategy.


The general thrust is that you, as exiled prince Alain, are gaining allies to help in your fight against a general who's stolen your throne. It has a mix of an overworld and zoomed-in battles, with squads of units that can traverse the world.

I'll make the same pitch I made decades ago when I came across it on the SNES: it's an all-comers RPG. No matter how much you might dislike the genre or Mario as a concept, it has plenty of ways to win you over. It's also perfect for folks newer to RPGs as a whole and there are enough hooks present for veterans.


If you're already on board or can't be swayed, there's plenty of other stuff to sift through too. Persona 5 Tactica and Bluey: The Videogame both arrive on November 17; and Howl, Backpack Hero, Passpartout 2: The Lost Artist, and Enjoy the Diner all came out as a result of the recent Indie World Showcase.

"But it works out cheaper!" I’d plead, sobbing, into disinterested ears. So be it – at least with the Black Friday sales going on, a prebuilt rig can be much better value that it would otherwise. The PCs on this list, some of which have several hundred pounds/dollars off their usual prices, are testament to that.

Some folks get pumped whenever they see a new Pokémon. Others just want to see a few dozen Slimes and a Goonache Goodie, which looks like a little chocolate-stuffed croissant with a secret. Visions of flowery dragons and a bouncing Croc-a-Bugle-Doo —which is literally a crocodile with a bugle for a nose — dance in your mind. A Great Sabrecub snoozes and a Dracky flits about as David Attenborough-esque narration paints the full picture.

        <updated>2023-11-16T15:51:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It doesn't feel that long ago since Nvidia launched its RTX 4000 "Ada Lovelace" range. In fact, the 4090 only came out last October. However, there's a chance that Team Green may be halting production of two of its products.


That's according to a post on Board Channels (as spotted by Videocardz), which states that Nvidia has allegedly "discontinued" the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080. The information goes on to say that the "last distribution of goods in the 2023Q4 quarter has ended."


Image via Videocardz (source: Board Channels)


While the rumor has not been confirmed, one reason behind this could be so Nvidia can concentrate on newer models in the 4000 range. This could be in relation to the alleged RTX 4080 SUPER as well as a potential 4070 Ti SUPER.


Something could be lost in translation


As the report from Videocardz notes, there's no real way to verify whether this information is 100% accurate or not. There may be some miscommunication going on here. It's possible that what's being said is referring to a temporary hold on mass production of the RTX cards, as opposed to fully discontinuing the SKUs.


As always with these things, it's best to temper any immediate judgements you may have. Nvidia will hopefully come forward with official word on what's true and what isn't.


This current generation of graphics cards is only a year old (or just over) so it probably wouldn't make sense for a tech firm to completely discontinue products. More stock may be put into some SUPER variants, but it doesn't seem likely that Nvidia would cease production of two of its graphics cards at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ocean planet of GUP-14 is not a happy place. Its seabed has been gunked up with piles of trash, globs of purple gunge and nasty clouds of micro-plastics, all because an industrial megacorp couldn't be bothered to clean up after themselves after bleeding it for resources. That megacorp's since upped sticks to, sadly, continue their terrible ways somewhere else in the solar system, but calling out these bad practices (beyond them being obviously bad and not good for the planet) is not really Loddlenaut's concern here. 
Rather, your job is to simply clean up this mess with your array of high-tech gadgetry, healing its polluted environments so: a) it's not a grim, purple hellscape anymore; b) native, axolotl-like loddle creatures can move back in and prosper. It's simple, satisfying work that's designed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside without having to think too hard. But its straightforward, frictionless tale may leave some wishing it had just a little more bite, and less of a sense that you're laying the ground for some other faceless corpo power to go and splurge all over it again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 has been an utterly miserable time to be working in the video game industry. Announcements of layoffs from some of the biggest names around have been dominating news sections lately. While we already knew Embracer Group was one of them, we now know the figures.


In the most recent sales report from the Crystal Dynamics and Gearbox Software owner, the company has said it experienced a 13% increase in net sales between July and September of this year (Q2 of their 2023-2024 fiscal year).




It then goes on to acknowledge that "around 900" people were part of the "reduction in headcount." This equates to 5% of the whole workforce. That's quite an astonishing amount of people to let go. Embracer Group said it's also "reduced the number of projects" being worked on and is focussing on "improving the projected return on investment within PC/Console."


At least the company is doing well...


The report goes on to say that CEO Lars Wingeford would like to "put on record a special thanks to the people who have left Embracer in the quarter." Unfortunately, it's unlikely to bring much comfort to those who have lost their jobs.


We already knew that developers under Embracer's umbrella were being targeted for mass layoffs. However, this latest report really hammers home the extent to which studios have been affected by these "reductions."


You've heard this story dozens of times already. Ubisoft, Team17, Naughty Dog, Amazon, CD Projekt Red, and many more have all been involved in redundancies, many to the tune of hundreds. One wonders whether anyone would still be interested in seeking a career in game development after all this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sonic has been enjoying renewed popularity in recent years thanks to the two Sonic the Hedgehog movies that have become some of the highest-grossing video game adaptations. Sega hopes to capitalize on this by bringing more of its franchises to a non-gaming audience. 


In an interview with CNBC, Sega's chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi revealed that the platforms they are considering include movies and even Roblox. The second Sonic movie grossed an impressive $405.4 million, so it's no surprise that they hope to replicate this success with its other IPs. 


IPs that are being considered include Like a Dragon (previously known as Yakuza). An adaption could be a hit, as it already has a huge following. As Sega reveals, the franchise has sold 21.1 million units.


Persona may also find itself on more platforms. It's easy to imagine it being adapted to a film series or even a television series, as the franchise already features gripping narratives and plenty of relationships and friendships to explore.

Sega denies acquisition rumors


There have been rumors that Microsoft is keen to purchase Sega, but Utsumi denies this. He explains that several companies are interested in acquiring Sega, and though it is an honor, he doesn't believe that "kind of transaction is going to happen."


This doesn't mean that Sega isn't planning to make some acquisitions for itself. Utsumi claims the company is still looking for growth during a time when Japanese studios are doing well while "European studios are struggling" following the post-COVID-19 sales decline. 


We've seen some of the effects of this through the seemingly endless waves of layoffs that have struck the industry. Utsumi remains optimistic, and he believes that the future is bright so long as "you have solid development studios and also solid IPs."

By introducing credit card fraud, identity theft, and malware into the mix, it's hoped that piracy will absorb the juices of these 'real' crimes and be taken more seriously. In South Korea, where pirate movies and careless clicks turn innocent teenagers into crazed gambling addicts, anti-piracy messaging may have hit the jackpot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t heard by now, Metal Gear Solid’s Master Collection - which includes the first proper outing for MGS3: Snake Eater on PC - is a bit of a mess. Lacking graphics options, suffering from visual limitations and crashes, and generally barebones as a package, the catalogue of the first three Metal Gear Solid titles and their two Metal Gear prequels hasn’t exactly gone down well with players.

        <updated>2023-11-15T16:43:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a staff management game disguised as a dungeon management game. At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.


You can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games. But it's far too barebones to invest in seriously.

Following in the wake of Microsoft, Epic, CD Projekt, Sony and, well, take your pick, the company aim to cut roughly 30% of their workforce to shore up profits. The specific reasoning here is that Digital Bros think that people aren't interested in playing original new games; they'd rather get to grips with fictions and franchises they know and love already. As such, the company plan to "limit" their big budget projects in future, though no specific cancellations have been announced.

I’m exaggerating – for effect! – but there genuinely are some chunky savings to be had here, even on the very latest graphics cards with enhanced ray tracing and DLSS 3 support. It’s not just super-duper-high-end cards like the RTX 4080 that are getting cuts, either – the early deals I’ve found so far cover more affordable and/or mid-range far as well, like the Intel Arc A750 and RTX 4060 Ti. And there could be more to come, with Black Friday itself not rolling around until November 24th.

That's kind of the deal with American Arcadia, a puzzle-platformer about a dude who lives in an ultra advanced dome city that is for some reason 70s-themed, and is also a huge reality show for the Twitch generation. 
I actually love the 70s theme. This combined with story-within-a-story-within-a-story framing, bits of lovely, almost Wes Anderson-esque art design, and some extreme multi-tasking combining 2.5D and 3D makes American Arcadia an interesting little treat. Do the twists upon twists get a bit over cooked? Maybe. But you can live with it.

Behind Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on October 2023's best-selling list is Super Mario Bros.

The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a quick one before I clock off for the day: you would not believe what the kids are up to in Minecraft right now. Well, you probably would, because it's Minecraft, the sandbox building sim that contains all possibility and all human endeavour, with the exception of good PvP mechanics, yes I went there. 


Anyway, Minecraft update 1.21 is just around the corner, and a few players have gotten early access via Mojang's snapshot releases. I had thought the crown jewel of the update would be the new Trial Chambers, aka trap-filled mazes. It turns out the real star might be the new Breeze mob - in the hands of imaginative players, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo shared its latest Indie World showcase this morning and has become typical with these showcases, we learned about a number of new exciting indie games coming to Switch and Switch first, as well as some hit already-released games that will be making their way to Nintendo's platform.


Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution was arguably the most interesting title. Developer WayForward began development on the game 20 years ago, but never completed it. Next year, the game will finally make its way to Switch, but retain the Game Boy Advance aesthetic it was always meant to have.
Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition is bringing the excellent space-exploring mystery game to the handheld console and will include the Echoes of the Eye expansion. The game releases December 7 and a physical versio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Persona 5 kids are trapped in high school, their semesters stretched into infinity by the inescapable march of spin-offs that have been retroactively stuffed into every available blank spot. Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. 


Your energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic. Then again, if you're a Persona fan, it's still more than a good excuse to sink back into another adventure with your pals.

Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of charact…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-14T16:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making a strategy game is "harder than people give it credit for," Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it "late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles," but it's also "suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have," he says. 
Even now, "it's got some catching up to do," he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that "there's a thirst for something different now," both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. "We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.' That's the goal."

Much like The Boys, it's got a not-very-nice version of Superman, Omni-Man, who you might have seen doing not-very-nice things in Mortal Kombat lately.
Skybound and Kirkman's first videogame based on the license isn't about Omni-Man, though. Developed by Terrible Posture Games, it's about Atom Eve, a high-school do-gooder who can manipulate the atomic structure of the world, changing one thing into another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I can let a lot of you know whether you'd like Warhammer Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin with just a few words: it's about micromanagement. Victory is dependent on rapidly issuing movement, attack and ability commands to several small squads of soldiers, and your units will pay a heavy price if your attention leaves them for more than a few moments.

If that's not your thing, move along. If it is, Realms Of Ruin is a solid, button-down war 'em up and you should read on.

        <updated>2023-11-14T15:27:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. 

The gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.

Mustakro on Twitter has taken their enjoyment of the game's boss designs and turned some of Lies of P's toughest challenges into Cuphead-style bosses, and it rules. 


I came across Mustakro this morning, scrolling through my Twitter feed, when I saw a really awesome rendition of Lies of P's King of Puppets boss (one of the most difficult in the game) in the style of Rubberhose, which is that classic animation style popularized in the 1920s seen in Cuphead.

Hard-nosed private eye Rachel (RPS in peace) pronounced herself fascinated but a little stumped by it, back in April, while Graham described it as his "ideal game" in a post about the recent addition of infidelity cases and lost-and-found jobs, adding to my suspicions that Graham is some kind of jigsaw killer and that his news posts are actually ciphered confessions of his terrible crimes.
Well, these already viscous plots are about to thicken into a borderline-immobile soup of intrigue, for ColePowered Games are adding modding tools to the game. These will allow you to pen your own detective mysteries, and even alter the surrounding city to fit.

Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.

Whether it's selecting the next movie on your living room media PC, changing settings on your racing rig or getting your Steam Deck set up just the way you want it, having a convenient, all-in-one wireless option can be just the ticket. 
Logitech's K400 Plus is a popular model in this niche category, and normally retails for an affordable $28. Today though, it's down to $19 on Amazon, a sweet 32% discount that makes it near impulse buy territory for anyone that has a PC for which a regular mouse and keyboard setup isn't quite convenient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.
Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 


With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)
Bryan Fury
Claudio Serafino
Devil Jin
Feng Wei
Hwoarang
Jack-8 (New)
Jin Kazma
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya
King
Kuma
Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan
Leo Kliesen
Leroy Smith
Lili Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Raven
Reina (New)
Sergei Dragunov
Shaheen
Steve Fox
Victor Chevalier (New)
Yoshimitsu
Zafina
Additionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters. These characters will be released separately each season throughout 2024, with the first arriving sometime in the spring. 
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check our early hands-on impressions of the game here.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-13T18:37:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.
An excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:
There have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. 
In January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. 
In August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. 
Just last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.
The hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this summer, developer Evening Star Studios and publisher Private Division revealed Penny's Big Breakaway during a Nintendo Direct. While the throwback 3D platforming adventure looked great in its own right, what caught a lot of people's attention was the team behind it. Evening Star's creative director and lead engine architect is Christian Whitehead, one of the lead developers behind 2017's Sonic Mania. Whitehead isn't alone, though, as various other Evening Star developers also worked on Sonic Mania. While we've still got some time before the game's release – it's due out sometime in 2024 – Game Informer has a special sneak peek at its music and can exclusively reveal three tracks from the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake and Control developers Remedy Entertainment have announced that their untitled co-op shooter, the artist formerly known as project Vanguard, will no longer be a free-to-play game - largely, it seems, because the free-to-play business is looking a bit dicey. The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.


The reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase "due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.

November 13, 2023
As with every Indie World Showcase, the question must be asked: is this the time where we finally see Hollow Knight: Silksong, the Hollow Knight sequel from developer Team Cherry that began life as a DLC to the original game? It probably won't be but it's always fun to get your hopes up a little bit so that they may be gently crushed. 
Tomorrow's Indie World Showcase for Nintendo Switch begins at Noon ET. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then check out everything announced during the last Indie World Showcase, which was held in April, for a glance at what to potentially expect with tomorrow's. 
What game do you hope to see tomorrow during the Nintendo Indie World Showcase? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away is a film about a spoilt young girl who is obliged to work at a bathhouse for supernatural creatures, after her parents are turned into pigs by a wicked witch. Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.


I have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's "just for kids". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.

I would like to propose an analogous theory for horror games and cute games whereby past a certain point of cuteness, the videogame in question teeters over dramatically into dread and nausea. We could call it the "horseshuwu effect".


As evidence of this, please witness the unholy magnificence of Saccharinity of Starfield, a Starfield mod from lucyprrrr and the Sakura Candy Society, which treats Starfield's items, spaceships, buildings, vegetation, planet models and, worst of all, people to a barbie-doll makeover reminiscent of a seriously overclocked shoujo anime. Do you like pink? No you don't. Not this much.

Not only are the increasing girth of game installs making capacity more valuable than ever, but some new games are so reliant on fast loading that they can’t even run reliably on creaking old mechanical hard drives. Looking at you, Starfield and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Little scamps.

As such, I'm tickled gall-bladder-pink to hear that Blizzard consider the action-RPG series "a wonderful platform" for different types of game, now that they've made the leap to an open world format. 


For the most part, said experimentation will occur in the course of Diablo 4 expansions - the first of which, Diablo 2 throwback Vessel of Hatred, will launch in late 2024, adding a new class to the game described as "never before seen in the Diablo universe". But from the sounds of things, there's scope for the "franchise in general" to evolve too.

It just came out on Steam.

Enter Super Woden GP 2, which just released yesterday. It's a blend of Circuit Superstars with the simple car tweaking and progression of early Gran Turismo and it's already heating up my Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pirate IPTV service Beast TV shut down in 2020 in response to a lawsuit filed in Canada by several Hollywood studios, Netflix, Amazon, and Bell Media. A lawsuit filed Thursday in the United States claims to target a former 'Top 10' Beast TV reseller who allegedly still sells Beast TV-branded subscriptions. When Beast was shut down almost three years ago, an announcement on the defendant's alleged site, posted under a name that matches his, claimed the service was still alive.

It has been almost a year since the release of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, meaning it's been now a full year of apologies, paused expansions, and transformative patches. And yet it lives.

The co-op shooter now seems on firmer ground, and to celebrate it's getting a two-part update called The Traitor Curse. Part one will add a new zone and mission, among other updates.

Now there's an easier way to make those fangames. I Wanna Maker is a freeware precision platformer with level editor and easy level sharing, and it just hit version 1.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roadwarden's creator, the Polish writer and designer Aureus of Moral Anxiety Studio, is an enthusiastic and inventive player of table-top games. Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. "They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. 


"They had no shame!" Aureus goes on. "Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all."  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. "So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths."

We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.

"I used to play Descent with me piloting and my friend gunning!" they said).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.
Zelnick cautioned one investor against "generalising" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.
Here's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been "demade" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. 
Crow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've seen Netflix's Arcane League of Legends animated series, there's a high probability you really like it – the show's great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World of Warcraft's expansion pack The War Within, out next year, comes in several flavours. There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. 


Naturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.

As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360's Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces.

A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation's in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog's Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice.

If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!
