        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold has announced that I Am Your Beast is getting one least content update. Titled Cold Sweat, it will include “New Levels. No Story. Just CHALLENGE.” It hits January 23, 2025.


I Am Your Beast describes itself as "he's-in-the-walls" fantasy, and that’s a pretty effective way of describing its over-the-top power fantasy bent. It’s all about always moving while shooting, throwing, and stomping. Certain stages have different objectives, such as hacking laptops, but largely, you’re trying to just take out everyone wearing camo.




I reviewed it back at launch, and what really struck me about it was how readable it was the whole time. Despite all the chaos, you can easily tell what’s going on at any time. Every target, every attack, and every hit is well communicated, which enables you to pull off incredible feats of agility. I had some issues with the storytelling, but the game itself is butter.


Not much has been said about the update aside from what you need to know in general. It’s a challenging new set of levels, though from the original (now deleted) post, there doesn’t seemt o be a new narrative to connect them all, which makes it a bit different than the last one which put the new content in a neat little narrative package centered around survivors of the protagonist’s rampage.


I Am Your Beast is out now on PC. The Cold Sweat content update is out on January 23, 2025.

Ahhh, there's nothing like taking a detour in a video game. From sprawling open-world games to turn-based RPGs, sidequests are an almost essential part of the adventure. After all, can you really say you've saved the world or uncovered the secrets of your friends if you haven't collected all of the magical coins or you haven't helped the village mayor pay off a debt?
As we're approaching the end of the Switch's life, at Nintendo Life, we've been pondering all of our favourite sidequests we've experienced (or re-experienced) on the lovely little hybrid console. And there's no shortage of those optional yet magical expeditions.

It is very easy to forget the sheer volume of games that launch throughout an entire year. One month alone can have dozens of releases, let alone the rest as game development teams announce their plans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Pro Open Mystery Nation objective is now available in EA FC 25 as part of Matchday 7, and it allows you to win a free pack by completing a simple task.


If you have solved such objectives in the last few weeks, you'll know what to do. To complete the objective, you'll need to perform the required task using a player from the nation. Of course, the correct nation won't be stated at first, so you'll be have to find out the right choice. 


Disclaimer: Mystery Nation has been solved. 


EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective guide (Matchday 7)


Here's the objective task, which went live on January 20. The task for this matchday is identical to the previous ones. 



Score three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 7.




To complete the task, you'll have to select a card from the mystery nation, and score three goals with a finesse shot. This can be done in any Ultimate Team game mode, including friendlies as well. The job is pretty simple, and you can complete it across multiple games. 


Completing the task is going to earn you a free pack, along with coin boost. Over the last few weeks, we have been on a world tour. Last week, the mystery nation was Japan, so it's always hard to predict what the correct nation is.


Thankfully, the community has once again proved to be immensely helpful, and the correct nation for this week is Morocco. We have also finally had a nation from the African continent. Just use any item from the nation and score three finesse shot goals to unlock all the available rewards.

Quite a bold statement, as it seems to indicate the man could be done with the company he’d been working at for over 30 years. The post naturally sent many fans into a frenzy. This could prove the end of an era, and definitely not for the better.


The good news is that Harada is not leaving Bandai Namco. He responded to the thousands of puzzled fans and assured them he was just looking for more professional and personal connections.


Though he is the face of Tekken's public relations, Harada actually is not the creator of the Tekken series. Interestingly enough, he's only credited for his voice work as Yoshimitsu, Kunimit…]]></summary>

There was once a time when Banjo-Kazooie was rightly considered to be a close rival to the Super Mario franchise when Rare launched two outstanding entries on N64 in the form of the self-titled debut and its sequel, Banjo-Tooie.
That was a long time ago, though. While Microsoft flirted with idea of growing the franchise in 2008 with the rather divisive Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, the publisher hasn't touched it in the years since. According to Moon Studios' (Ori and the Blind Forest, Will of the Wisps) CEO Thomas Mahler on social media, however, this was perhaps the wrong move, and Microsoft may well be sitting on something that could, with the right treatment, rival 3D Mario games on modern consoles (thanks, Pure Xbox):

The Hollow Knight: Silksong community has been ablaze in recent weeks with theories and rumours aplenty about when the hotly-anticipated sequel will finally release. While none are yet to come to fruition, Team Cherry has provided a tiny development update, just to reassure everyone that the game actually does exist and it "will release" one day.
Last week, Hollow Knight co-creator William Pellen updated his Twitter profile picture to an image of a cake. For most fan bases, this wouldn't be enough to bat an eyelid, but when you've been waiting this many years for news from Hallownest, every change matters. The TL;DR of it is that fans traced this image back to an online recipe dated to 2nd April (the day of the Switch 2 Direct), and made the logical leap that this will be a big day for Silksong news.

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Load up on energy drinks, because Keep Driving, the road trip sim from the devs behind Post Void, is launching on PC on February 6th.


I played the demo of Keep Driving back in October, and the biggest complaint I came away with was that its difficulty leaned on the easy side, which I largely attributed to its unbalanced economy. I was able to get quite a bit of padding in my pocket, which made it really easy to deal with any trouble that came my way.




The best description I can give of Keep Driving is that it’s a lot like Oregon Trail. It’s set during the early 2000s, with you setting out in your very first car to enjoy the last days of your youth. You don’t exactly drive, but instead, set your car on its journey, then make decisions as various events turn up to complicate your relaxing drive. They range from simple potholes to livestock. Each time one pops up, you use a variety of ability cards to try and mitigate the effects it can have. You can sometimes pick up hitchhikers who can either help or hinder your trip. The goal is to keep yourself and your car together long enough to reach it to your friend’s house to play video games.


I’m pretty excited to see how Keep Driving was improved on over the past few months. It was already in decent shape in October and just needed a bit more meat and a bit of polish. Should be a good time.


Keep Driving releases on February 6, 2025 for PC.

Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

Last week saw the Wii's Donkey Kong Country Returns return in HD on Switch. Following the first time it returned on 3DS, the Switch port — helmed by Forever Entertainment this time, with the original devs at Retro getting only a cursory nod in the credits this time — brought the levels of the 2013 3DS port to the big screen in high-def with a modest dusting of tweaks.
We liked DKC Returns HD, awarding it a 7/10 in our review, but felt that a classic like this deserved a little bit more care and attention — the 'Deluxe' treatment, if you will — especially given the price point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of creatures you can catch in Fisch, but landing the secret fish is the hardest task to complete.


So far, there are three secret fish that can be caught inside the game, but they can prove to be stern tests. These three creatures are the hardest ones to catch, and they're not even part of the official bestiary. Let's take a look at how you can obtain them inside the game. 


How to catch all  three secret fish in Fisch


As of the latest Atlantean Storm update, there are three fish to catch. 


Fish
Type
Location
Preferred Bait
Season
Weather




Banana Fish
Secret
Ancient Isle
None
Summer
Rain


Long Pike
Secret
Ocean Territory
Insects
Autumn, Spring
Rain


Mustard Fish
Secret
Ocean Territory
Sea Weed
Summer
Rain






The greatest difficulty of getting the secret fish are their spawn rate. They're not part of the official bestiary, which means that you're not supposed to find them inside the game. The Banana Fish, for example, is only meant for admins and partnered content creators. Yet, you might get lucky and land one with the correct setup.


Thankfully, you don't really need the very best rods to land them. You should fully focus on Season, Weather, and Bait, along with the locations. The odds of landing these fish are low to begin with. Without the preferred setup, it will be next to impossible to catch these creatures, irrespective of your rod and player levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To celebrate Palworld's first anniversary, Pocketpair has revealed the game's Early Access roadmap, offering players a glimpse at the content they can expect to receive on the road to a 1.0 release.


Palworld came out of the gates swinging at the start of 2024, becoming a surprise mega-hit for Pocketpair despite still being an Early Access title. The game's unique "Pokemon with guns" theme was enough to pique gamers' curiosities, making the game an overnight success. While the player count hasn't remained at the dizzying heights of its launch period, Palworld remains extremely popular.


Palworld teases Early Access roadmap


Despite Palworld's popularity, Pocketpair never rested on its laurels, continuing to deliver frequent content for players. Now, as it celebrates the game's first anniversary, the developer has revealed the future roadmap as Palworld hurtles toward its 1.0 release.

Before Palworld fully launches, there are some pretty big features on the way. Headlining the roadmap is the addition of co-op crossplay, which will allow you to team up with your friends no matter where they play. The chance to transfer Pals between worlds and a potential ending scenario should also be an exciting prospect for fans. 


Also in the pipeline is the already-announced Palworld x Terraria crossover, although this roadmap seems to hint at even more collaborations in the future. Then, there are the seemingly obvious things such as new Pals and technologies, which most could have guessed were on the way at some point. Finally, the roadmap reaches the generic "Other Improvements" category, promising vague improvements across the board in various areas.


At the moment, Pocketpair has yet to provide a timeline for all of its planned Early Access content. Given the scale of the updates released over the last 12 months, it's not impossible to think most of the roadmap content will arrive in 2025.

The latest of these games is Cursed Digicam, and it's getting a lot of attention. 


The story of Cursed Digicam follows a father as he tries to free his dead daughter’s spirit from being trapped with the aid of a special camera made by a medium, and a website that promises to use the photos to free the spirit. 


Of course, it’s not that straightforward, and there’s also a questionable mouse mascot who haunts you at every step, and a twisted tale to uncover as you play. 


The game also has a short list of achievements, most of which require you to take every photo that can possibly be taken in the three different…]]></summary>

If you're not familiar, it's an annual literature event that declares one judge-picked novel as the "best work of sustained fiction of the year, written in English and published in the UK or Ireland," as the Wikipedia page puts it.


Currently, winners are awarded a cash prize of £50,000 (just over $60,000), plus a trophy and no doubt a pretty steep uptick in sales. Now, if you've heard of this prestigious honor, but have never checked it out, it can seem a bit daunting knowing which books to read to get an idea of what makes a prize-winning novel in the charity's eyes.

The launch price for the Nintendo Switch 2 is, at the time of writing, unknown and will likely remain that way until Nintendo's big Direct presentation in April.
However, according to Circana (NPD) analyst Mat Piscatella, the eventual price of the console likely won't matter for the early adopters amongst us. In speaking with GamesRadar+, he stated that as long as the cost of the machine isn't "egregious", then it will likely sell.

Over the weekend, Reddit user OyeDiego took to the r/MySims group to report that two new MySims bundles were briefly listed on the EA App before being swiftly removed (thanks for the heads up, Eurogamer). Titled 'MySims Action Bundle' and 'MySims Beacon Bay', the Redditor claims that neither page had any pictures or game information, but they were home to a PEGI 7 age rating and a placeholder date of 2099.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long is left for the Atlantis core update to go live in Fisch, and it could introduce a lot of amazing content to the game.


It's almost a month since Fisch received the last major update in the form of the Northern Expedition. Something similar, or even better, could be waiting for us as part of the next update. Thankfully, the wait isn't long, and there's less than a week before the upcoming update goes live.


Fisch Atlantis update release date


Typically, new updates are always released on Saturdays in Fisch at 1 p.m. GMT/5 a.m. PST/8 a.m. EST. Since the Northern Expedition update, we have had three weekends of mini-content updates in preparation for the Atlantis core update. As per the existing schedule, the next core update will go live on Saturday, January 25.


Unless there is any more delay, we will get a new update after four weeks from the previous core update. It will be interesting to find out what the developers have in plan for the community.


What to expect from the Atlantis update in Fisch


It's safe to expect something similar to the Northern Expedition update. We might end up with a new region, along with a fresh bestiary, rods, and more. In Northern Expedition, 36 new species were added. I believe a lot of new fish will be added to the game very soon.


It has been a long time since a new rod was added to the game as well. We have had a few good additions like Rod of the Exalted One since Northern Expedition, but we might finally have multiple ones as part of the Atlantis update.


So far, the developers haven't given a sneak peek of the contents coming to Fisch as part of the next update. We will have detailed guides about the upcoming update once it goes live.

Without further ado, here are all the SAM Ore locations in Satisfactory. 


How many types of SAM Ores are there?


In Satisfactory 1.0, SAM Ores appear in three rarities:



Pure


Normal


Impure



Pure SAM Ore gives you the best yield, while Impure gives you the worst, so always try to find Pure SAM Ores when you can. Prioritize Normal SAM Ore above Impure Sam Ore, as well.

A new report from Japanese business journal Diamond Online has provided a rundown of companies with the highest average annual salaries in Western Japan for FY2024, and Nintendo is right up there with the best of them (thanks, Automaton).
According to the report, Nintendo paid an average annual salary of 9,627,000 yen in the last fiscal year (around £51,000 / $62,000 at the current exchange rate), landing the company with the second-highest average paycheck in the region — and the only entertainment company to land a spot in the top five, no less.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have made it your mission to find valuable items in Dig It, finding the Secret Items will be high on your wishlist.


These items have been added as part of the latest update, and the odds of them spawning in the terrain are pretty low. However, you'll be able to find nine different items at various locations and add them to your collection.


How to get all secret items in Dig It


There's no sure-shot way of getting these nine items, and the odds of them spawning on a map are extremely low. Naturally, you'll want to do everything possible in order to improve your chances, and Mythical Magnets will be highly useful. Whenever you use Magnets of this rarity, all items below Mythical will drop out from the pool.


Secret Item
Preferred Magnet
Effect




Ban Hammer
Mythical
Ban someone on the server for fun


Body Pillow
Mythical
A pillow that will have your avatar image. 


Dimensional Door
Mythical
Allows you to use the Void World


Disco Ball
Mythical
Makes your character dance by equipping the Disco Ball


Kawaii Nuke
Mythical
A different version of the Nuke, and explodes with glitters and sparkles


Pocket Cat
Mythical
Change yourself into a small cat


Philosopher
Mythical
Type any word on the chat box and get a random message based on what you typed


Scissors
Mythical
Cut any other player near you


Sky Ladder
Mythical
Spawn a magical ladder that will help you to reach the sky






It's quite possible that we might get more secret items as part of future items. Apart from using Mythical Magnets, you can use shovels that boost your luck. The Meteor Shovel, with its 40% boost to base luck could help you in your cause. Make sure to check out the full tier list to have the best equipment ready if you go out to find out these items.


Additionally, you can find the secret items on any island or diggable terrain, which makes it slightly easier to boost your chances.

There are layers upon layers of memes and sheer desperation to be uncovered here, and honestly, they're not for the faint of heart. To begin with, it's important to keep in mind that Team Cherry, the developer of Hollow Knight, hasn't exactly been forthcoming with information about Silksong. We know that the game exists, yes, and its rough outline is more-or-less set in place, but everything else is a huge unknown.

Nintendo's latest release, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, has made its debut at number one in the UK following its launch on 16th January 2025.
It's a decent start for the remaster, which has notably received quite a bit of backlash online over its price in the months leading up to its release. That said, despite our own senitment that the game isn't quite the definitive version of Retro Studio's original Wii classic, it's still probably worth checking out if you've never experienced it before.

It's often considered one of the greatest video games of all time, up there with the likes of GoldenEye 007 on Nintendo 64, the original Doom, and Halo 3.


And thanks to the modding community, I get to keep talking about the game. In this instance, there's an upcoming mod that should appeal to fans of Cyberpunk 2077 or Deus Ex. Created by user Guild of Inventors over on ModDB, The Last Goodbye fully converts Half-Life into a neo-noir game with a Dick Tracy lean.

Due to security threats and farming user data, it has been a hot-button topic in Congress ever since 2020. Bytedance had to sell TikTok’s operations to the US, otherwise the ban would likely go through. 


What many didn’t realize is that Bytedance and its subsidiaries, including Marvel Snap, would all be affected by this umbrella ban. TikTok’s parent company, Bytedance, owns another company called Nuverse, which is home to the popular mobile card game.

As part of an interview leading into the first Zine Quest in 2019, Kickstarter got RPG historian Jon Peterson to explain the importance of an event like this: "Zines were the primordial soup where the ideas that became RPGs bounced around, combined with each other, and eventually merged into something amazing.”

Pokémon fans get excited whenever McDonalds rolls out a new set of cards, and they have a good reason to. Not only do McDonald's cards feature unique art, but they're never reprinted after the promotion ends. Once they're gone, they're gone. 


Thanks to this, McDonald's exclusive Pokémon cards inevitably become some of the rarest cards in their owner's decks and some of the most expensive in the collecting circuit. Here are the most valuable McDonald's Pokémon promo cards of all time, r…]]></summary>

Uživatelé čínskou firmou vlastněné sociální sítě dostali zprávu, že aplikaci kvůli zákazu nelze používat. TikTok je momentálně nedostupný v obchodech s aplikacemi Google Play a App Store. Podle zákona přijatého loni a potvrzeného v pátek soudem měla platforma do dneška přerušit spojení se svou mateřskou společností ByteDance, která sídlí v Číně, nebo činnost v USA ukončit, aby se vyřešily obavy, že představuje hrozbu pro národní bezpečnost. Nově zvolený americký prezident Donald Trump v sobotu uvedl, že po svém pondělním nástupu do funkce s největší pravděpodobností rozhodne o 90denním odkladu zákazu TikToku.]]></summary>

Nintendo finally lifted the lid on the Switch 2 earlier this week and while most of the discussion is about the new hardware, there has also been plenty of conversation about the new Mario Kart game.
Perhaps the biggest talking point at the moment about this new entry is the fact there have been 24 spaces spotted on the starting grid. Now, if you've played Mario Kart over the years, you should already know how the race size has jumped from eight to 12 players, so this seems to be another leap.

Total cracking time: 628 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

If I hold my thumb down on the photo in my phone's gallery, it actually springs to life for a few seconds and rewinds time in the process. It shows me wobble the phone into position and take the snap: a giant crab clings to a restaurant, a lady totters towards us with a white plastic bag looped around her arm, colourful signs stacked like Legos jut out of grey, "The Body Shop" lies in the distance because of course it does.
It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

As with Deedlit - one of our favourite 'vanias - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

On the one hand, as a fan of weird forests, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.

It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.

The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.

That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. Nagneto, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?

OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

Interesting, perhaps, but after 15 years of effort, did site-blocking actually work and, if so, who benefited, and how?

If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.

But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!"
You might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake.

Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.
Developed by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to "skip the story" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the "elevated horror" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.
One unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 devs. As hinted at a couple of times over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.
Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "spance" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 


It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. 
In Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins. Finally, a game brave enough to ask: "what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?".
It's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

DomainTools currently reports over 154 million registered .com domains, 129,000 of those registered in the last day alone. Total number of registered .to domains is just 26,000, available from a website that has barely changed in over 25 years. So if we rule out an appreciation of 1997 web design, what fuels pirate sites' enduring love affair with .to?

I'm afraid I'll fall over, but weirdly I'm not so worried about, I dunno, hitting my head, as I am wanging my elbow and getting that jolt of fuzzy numbness all the way down my arm. At least if I hit my head I wouldn't be around to feel the aftermath.
For all you fellows who are equally afeared of the outside world, let's all agree to stay indoors and play some excellent games. Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

The prologue starts you off as the handsomely equipped and fully levelled-up bodyguard of Sir Hans Capon - an exasperating gadabout and your bosom chum from the 2018 game. You're on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he'll take your own lord's side in the on-going civil war. But Plot intervenes in the shape of some suspiciously familiar bandits, who slaughter your retinue and reduce Henry and Sir Hans to a pair of shirtless runaways.

The researchers who are probably robots and you usually pick because they can be competitive at anything. The diplomacy/espionage ones (humans, or The Greys).
You know what I'm talking about. You may well have thought of a recent exception too, since we've had a fair few 4Xeses experimenting with some of the standard formulae these last few years. It's been a while though since I read through every word of every faction's description and wanted to play all of them. Zephon captured my interest immediately.

The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about "a land full of people being made into a people without land."

Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn't do it, wrong. I know I've already put you off, so I don't blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn't stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.

Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a new Lenovo Legion Go on the way, and while it’s ditching the signature detachable controllers, it’s still got something unusual to stick on its CV. The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed SteamOS handheld outside of Valve’s own Steam Deck range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last night, at CES 2025, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series graphics cards, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here's a trailer.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.
Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

This led to a social media dog-pile of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, a howl of derision that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. 
Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny "Nad Tatrou sa blýská" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté "hradní" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kvalitní herecké výkony a režie, ale v ostatních ohledech (např. scénář, kamera...) nic zajímavého. Hlavní hrdinka se trápí, trápí, a trápí... až je konec. Trápení je v průběhu filmu trochu permutováno, ale jde pouze o střípky, které (záměrně?) nevytvářejí žádný dramatický celek, natož zápletku. (Ilča 50 %)]]></summary>

Výsledek je tudíž poněkud schizofrenní, chvíli artový, chvíli komerční, a nepříjemně rozvleklý. (Ilča 70 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
