        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1995, Nintendo and Rare released Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest for the Super Nintendo, and it quickly became one of the best platformers on the console. This is due to several reasons, but one of the biggest ones is composer David Wise's beautiful soundtrack.

Fortunately, longtime fans of the series can now finally listen to this groundbreaking score in an official manner. Some people on social media websites like Reddit or Twitter/X quickly noticed that Nintendo just added the entire Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest to its new music app, Nintendo Music. In case you missed it, the gaming giant announced and released this app less than a week ago, and the first Donkey Kong Country's soundtrack was already on its catalog …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Centurions promo is coming soon to EA FC 25, and the upcoming campaign can feature some unique cards if you pay attention to the rumors.


Centurions will feature special cards of active footballers and former legends, just like last year. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about which cards will be part of the promo. However, several rumors have become available online, indicating the items that will be present in the promo.


Complete list of EA FC 25 Centurions promo players (leaks)


So far, the leaks have revolved around the icons. These are unique cards of former legends, and Centurions will introduce a new version. Here's the list of available icons that are rumored to appear as part of the upcoming promo.



Hernan Crespo


Gianluca Zambrotta


Juan Sebastian Veron


Pavel Nedved


David Beckham


Bastian Schweinsteiger


Ruud Van Nistelrooy


Edwin Van der Sar


Sol Campbell


Michael Laudrup


Foudy


Franck Ribery



The list of the icons looks pretty stacked, but we have no idea about their overall ratings or playstyles. That could be a big difference maker, and it's more than likely that EA Sports could add separate playstyles on the Centurions version.


So far, we have rumors of another special card for the recent Ballon d'Or winner, Rodri. Interestingly, the Centurions promo could feature several Ballon d'Or nominees, so that team of cards could be amazing as well. The list consists of the world's most prominent footballers, so it will be interesting to find out who makes it to the promo.


The Centurions promo could be a two-team affair as well, although that remains to be seen for the time-being. Additionally, it will be fun to have a couple of Centurions Icons as SBCs. We are yet to get a single Icon SBC this year in Ultimate Team, so breaking the duck will be a nice moment for the community.

The original vanilla World of Warcraft launched back in 2004, and has since then received ten expansion packs with two more already announced and on the way. As part of the 20th-anniversary celebration, another Blizzard title, Diablo Immortal, is hosting an event to honor the MMORPG's long history.





It would have been awesome to see this event in Diablo 4 as opposed to Diablo Immortal, but I'm assuming the recent release of the first Diablo 4 expansion, Vessel of Hatred, played a role in preventing that. Instead, starting November 13 at 3 a.m. local time, players will be able to take part in the Eternal War during the 20th-anniversary event and acquire event-specific rewards themed around World of Warcraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Matteo Politano vs Matteo Darmian Showdown SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can get up to two special cards from the Serie A.


This is the second Showdown SBC that has been featured in this year's Ultimate Team, and it includes two 84-rated items. Both item will have the same chance of getting upgrades in the future based on the real-life result of the contest between Inter and Napoli. Let's take a look at the two challenges, and how to complete them easily. 


All EA FC 25 Matteo Politano vs Matteo Darmian Showdown SBC solutions


The Matteo Politano vs Matteo Darmian Showdown SBC has two special challenges. You can complete either one of them, or do both (if you want both cards in your squad). First, let's take a look at how to get Politano's Showdown item, which requires you to finish two tasks. 


Task 1 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 82



Solution



Any 10 82-rated items


Any 1 81 rated TOTW item



Task 2 - Serie A

Next up, here are the conditions that you'll need to complete in order to get Matteo Darmian's Showdown card. 


Task 1 - 80-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 80



Solution



Any 11 80-rated items



Task 2 - 81-Rated Squad

Well, at least until the Zombies mode became a staple of the Call of Duty series, becoming as much a part of the franchise as its multiplayer and campaign modes.


Since its original inception in Call of Duty: World at War, many players have grown attached to Zombies, as it provides a fun co-op excursion from the series' standard modes. However, with so many titles now including the mode, the amount of available maps has skyrocketed. Here are the 15 best Zombies maps across all Call of Duty games.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: "yup, it's COD", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike past titles, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched with an entirely new set of maps rather than reusing old ones, but unfortunately, not all of them are hits, exactly. Here are the worst maps in Black Ops 6.


Ranking the Worst Maps in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6


Black Ops 6 was released with a healthy selection of 14 unique maps, which is quite modest for a Call of Duty title. Not all maps were created equal though, and of these 14, some of them are, let's just say, not as appetizing to play on as others. 


Red Card


Starting with the absolute worst map in the game, Red Card is a really cool concept on paper but plays awful in-game. Not only is it on the large side of the spectrum (meaning a lot more running around and less shooting), but it has quite a few genuine problems that aff…]]></summary>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Treyarch might have released a major patch for Call of Duty Black Ops 6 to fix some of the existing bugs and improve overall balance, but there might have been a collateral hit along the way.


Certain users are reporting receiving less XP after completing their games. Interestingly, there wasn't any mention in the patch notes about any work being done on XP rewards after finishing a game. Sadly, several players are now finding the grind pretty hard due to what seems like an unintended change on Treyarch's part.


Call of Duty Black Ops 6 XP bug explained


The November 4 update introduced some major rework if you have gone through the patch notes. Only the Face Off modes were targeted for improper XP rewards, and those who played would know exactly how easy it was to farm XP in that mode.


The same bit of the patch might have accidentally resulted in the other modes giving out nerfed XP rewards. I have already noticed that the amount of XP you get from Nuketown is no longer the same. But as it turns out, I am not the only one, and a few other members on Reddit have already reported on the same issue.




Officially, there has been no reduction in the amount of XP you get after finishing matches in Call of Duty Black Ops 6. I haven't noticed any obvious issue with the XP you get in the Zombies mode. But multiplayer definitely has some issues as of writing.


Since there's no mention of such a change in the patch notes, it's most likely a bug. In that case, I would expect it to be fixed pretty quickly so that we can all get back to our usual rate of camo grinding. Until then, prepare to expect a lot of frustration and longer waiting time to unlock the different camos, especially those that are unlocked at higher prestige levels.


As for camos, you can unlock plenty of them across the Zombies and Multiplayer modes. Here's the complete list of all skins that can be obtained for free by completing different achievements.

It is very easy to forget the sheer volume of games that launch throughout an entire year. One month alone can have dozens of releases, let alone the rest as game development teams announce their plans. 


If you’re looking to plan ahead or tell others about an upcoming release, we have a complete list of games confirmed to launch in 2025. We’ll also continue updating this list as we learn about new releases and delays.

We're also continuing to see the rise of expansions for some of the most famous games out there, from World of Warcraft: The War Within to Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 


With all that said, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of game releases as the months go on, especially if you're partway through a playthrough and learn that more games are launching the same week.

It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

Really, we last heard about Showa American Story back in early 2022, and since then, it’s been pretty quiet. I had some worry that its development might have quietly ended. It looks like a pretty ambitious project, but then, it’s hard to really figure out what’s going on in the trailer. Nothing in the marketing suggests it’s an open-world game, but there are many scenes of traveling through the desert. There’s exploration and combat and zombies; it’s how it all fits together that is a mystery.

More specifically, Seekers of the Storm is still "enjoying" a Mostly Negative review rating on Steam due to its many faults. Highlights include a remarkable number of technical problems (e.g. the reworked base game tied its physics to frame rate), a smaller amount of content than its Hopoo-produced predecessor, and a questionable balancing act for the new goodies. The former developers weren't thrilled with what Gearbox had done to the title, either. The good news, though, is that Gearbox did clear up most of the bugs…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Zone.
Lauded on its original 2007 release, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow Of Chornobyl dropped players into a stark world, filled with effective horror and precision combat. It spawned two sequels, both of which refined and improved on the model of their predecessor. Ukraine-based GSC Game World’s Legends Of The Zone bundle squeezes all three expansive adventures onto Switch with modern optimisations and stable visual performance, although each title is also available as a standalone purchase. It’s worth noting that this is the series' first time on consoles (with the PlayStation versions released back in March), which makes the competency of these ports all the more impressive.
Taking inspiration from the 1971 Russian novel Roadside Picnic, Shadows Of Chornobyl is set in the irradiated wilderness of the Zone. Decades after repopulation efforts, a second Chornobyl disaster occurs, turning residents into mutated creatures and littering the countryside with deadly elemental anomalies. The haunting and oppressive atmosphere of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film adaptation Stalker, is prevalent throughout. The Zone always feels like an alien landscape, or a bad dream.

It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Communication is key to success in PUBG, and the ping system lets you quickly share vital information with your friends.


Whether you're playing on your PC or console, you can use the ping option to mark enemies, items, and locations for your allies. Being on a voice chat helps, but a simple ping reduces the need for words between you and your buddies. Let's look at how the system works on both PC and consoles.


How to use the Ping function in PUBG


Whether you're playing on a PC or console, the core function of Ping is the same. It helps your buddy see something they haven't but you have. To ping, you can use the Middle Mouse button, and the object/enemy/location will be highlighted on the map.


On consoles, you'll need to aim at the object/enemy and press the RB/Right Bumper button to mark. While the system is easier to manage on a PC with a mouse, those on controllers can make good use of it if they know what they're doing.

The ping system has been improved in previous updates, which lets you mark almost anything in PUBG. Here are the three main uses of the ping inside a game.



Mark enemies - This makes eliminating enemies easier, as your ally will know precisely where to look. This is even more useful if someone does the spotting with a sniper rifle, as it's easier to spot from a distance and alert your friends.


Mark objects - This can include any type of loot and chests. You can also mark airdrop crates that often include valuable gear and consumables.


Mark a location—This is highly useful if you're not on voice chat and playing with strangers. Pinging a location on the map will help you let your team know where you're planning to go.



That's pretty much it when it comes to PUBG's ping system. In some tight contests, they can become a big difference-maker while securing a valuable drop or finishing off an enemy from a distance.

Vehicle selection is still questionable in some respects, though things are looking up. The first order of business is new-generation NASCAR, surprising as it may be.


I was already quite fond of Update 13's assortment of content both new and old and a huge roster of quality-of-life updates, but Update 14 aims to properly outpace it. If you thought we have plenty of Mustangs in this game already, boy howdy has Turn 10 got news for you. Featuring the 2024 editions of NASCAR next-gen Mustang, Camaro, and Camry vehicles, Forza Motorsport is about to become the single most cutting-edge NASCAR racing game on the market. And, honestly, I didn't see this coming at all.

The Weightgate, as it's come to be known, suggests that there have been some serious RNG Perk weighting problems that Bungie's been overlooking, but the fix is coming soon.


More specifically, Bungie has not only acknowledged that something's up with the way certain Legendary weapons drop but also promised full-fledged reparations to all players. The fix is dropping on November 5 as part of Hotfix 8.1.0.4, and it's a real doozy. Not only should this resolve any and all Perk weighting in the future, but it also comes with a real treat: an assortment of top-tier god roll Legendary weapons that were affected by the RNG problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It must be a huge weight off the collective shoulders of everyone at Bloober Team to see the remake of Silent Hill 2 is doing pretty well for itself. Steam shows the game as "Overwhelmingly Positive" for all reviews, so it definitely proves the wait was worth it in the end.


As a survival horror game, Silent Hill 2 is dripping with mood, atmosphere, anguish, sorrow, and grotesque denizens. What it's not dripping with, however, is a potassium-based snack. This is where Nexus Mods user Stevebg23 comes to the rescue with a mod that changes the pistol James finds into a large banana.

As if that wasn't enough, you'll also find that the lead pipe – a classic of the original 2001 release, many would say – has also been changed. Now, the player will find themselves beating the snot out of monsters with a giant spoon.


Because of reasons, I guess


The reason for the "Banana Gun and Spoon Pipe" mod is simple: the creator "always wanted to have a silly mod," and this is the result. They also reassure us you can reload the skin of the gun, and that the spoon is "shiny and silvery and nice to handle against the hordes of evil coming your way." Comforting to know.


Despite its seriousness, anyone who's played the original Silent Hill 2 knows the developer was not afraid to get a little silly. The infamous dog ending showed a kind of light-hearted irreverence for this drab horror experience that many of us were absolutely not expecting the first time around.


Of course, the game is still the same, even if you do swap out the pistol for a healthy-looking, half-peeled banana. It's nice to know James is getting his vitamins while battling the inner demons of his guilty conscience.

With the release of Nintendo's financial report for Q2 FY2025, we have updated sales figures for some of the year's biggest Switch titles. And what do you know, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has hit a pretty impressive milestone.
At the latest count (up to September 2024), the Switch remake has pulled in 1.94 million sales since its release in May. It's a decent number (if not a particularly high one by Nintendo's standards), but what makes this figure so special is that it's higher than TTYD's lifetime sales on GameCube — which sales-tracking website VGChartz puts at 1.91 million. Yes, after just four months, the remake has outsold the original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard might be a single-player experience, but you rarely play alone, and that's only possible thanks to your companions.


However, your available number of companions will always be more than your squad size, so you'll have to make some critical decisions. While you can shuffle and switch your party members inside the game, it can't be done whenever you want. Hence, it's crucial to understand how you can change your party composition.


When can you change your party members in Dragon Age: The Veilguard


There are two moments when you can specifically alter your party composition in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It can be done right at the beginning of a fresh quest when you're about to leave your Lighthouse. Once you've selected the pursuit and its location, you can access the "Change Party" option. It will show your two existing party members, and you can change any/both of them based on your preferences.


The only exception to this is that some quests have predetermined team members. In some instances, you'll lose access to certain members, but that mostly happens in the endgame, so you don't have to stress about that in the beginning.

You can also change the composition of your party at Beacons. You'll come across beacons while traveling the lands, and they're instrumental as they allow you to fast travel. But your fallen teammates will also be available at your beacons, where you can "Gather Your Party." Not only can you recall all your fallen party members, but you can also shuffle the composition.


Do note that your available companions will gradually increase as you complete more quests in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The main campaign has three different acts, and there is additional content like side quests, Faction quests, and more. All your companions also have their own story arcs, so there's plenty to explore and complete.

Blimey, has it already been three months since the last lot?
Yes, it's time for another round of Nintendo financial results, and we can soon expect the usual investor Q&A with Shuntaro Furukawa and co. deflecting questions about the Switch "successor" and then explaining how the Nintendo Music app is one example of the company's continued efforts to increase the value of NSO, and that the Nintendo Museum is helping spread awareness of its IP, and that the expansion of the theme parks and upcoming movie plans... yadda yadda, etc. etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a huge variety of different fish available to catch and catalog in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and they all have specific recipes that call for them. One of these fish, the Lancetfish, can be particularly elusive. 


Although you should definitely cook your Lancetfish before consuming them, even some Lancetfish Sushi (not an actual recipe in DDLV) will net you 1,300 energy when consumed. Lancetfish is also a particularly lucrative fish to hunt for, with each selling to Goofy for 650 Star Coins. 


As with all fish and items in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you can also use it as a decoration. It takes up a 2x1 area when placed. To put your Lancetfish on display, enter your inventory and drop it, then enter the furniture menu and move it to where you want it.

If you’ve ever managed to get your hands on a once-in-a-game item and then somehow gone on to lose it, whether by accidentally discarding it or through a horrible accident, there’s now a way to get those items back — the Lost Item Shop.

As reported by the BBC, police have stated that the theft of a Charizard card took place in Heathfield in East Sussex between 2nd and 5th September 2024. The same card was then found to have been listed for sale on Facebook, leading to a search order being completed on an address in Polegate, roughly 11-12 miles away from the original location.

        <updated>2024-11-05T11:31:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Black Ops 6 local multiplayer is something many fans want as it's been a part of the series for decades. Playing against your friends or with them in co-op on the couch is a memory many cherish and would like to resume in 2024 and beyond. 


Is Call of Duty Black Ops 6 split-screen-capable with friends?


Thankfully, you can play both the zombies mode and multiplayer with split-screen functionality. There's a catch, however. PS4, Xbox One, and PC Call of Duty Black Ops 6 players can't use split-screen and are only able to play with one player at all times. Only those on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S can play a round of Team Deathmatch with a mate on the couch with split-screen. Simply connect the second controller and have them press A or the cross button at the lobby. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


The positive is that the split-screen covers the entire screen with no cut-off sections. It's fully 16:9. It doesn't seem like you can play competitively against each other, however. I've tried to start a local multiplayer match under the "Private Match" mode and it didn't connect a second controller.


Does Call of Duty Black Ops 6 need to connect online?


Unfortunately, you'll need to always be online while playing Call of Duty Black Ops 6, even for the single-player campaign. This means that LAN has become obsolete. At least, some form of Black Ops 6 local multiplayer is supported through split-screen.


Do you need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass to play Call of Duty Black Ops 6 online?


If you're playing the game on PS4 and PS5, you'll need at least PlayStation Plus Essential to access Call of Duty Black Ops 6's multiplayer matchmaking. This is the same with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S users with Xbox Game Pass Core and up. Thankfully, both of these services come with free games each month. November 2024, for example, has Ghostwire Tokyo and Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 included with your subscription.

The blue blur's latest adventure has slipped out of the top ten this week, winding up in 13th while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and EA Sports FC 25 both cling onto the gold and silver. Dragon Age: The Veilguard debuts in third, but it's a slightly quiet one on the Nintendo front.

Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

Now, officially, the financial data covers the first six-month period of FY2025 ending on September 30th 2024. Nintendo has played a bit fast and loose when it comes to announcing sales for new titles, so it's not known at this time whether the figures for Echoes of Wisdom just cover the six days between its release and the end of the six-month period, or if Nintendo has simply pulled the most recent data available.

Throw some romance into the mix, especially angsty, will-they-won’t-they relationships between two people who seem indescribably wrong for each other, and you’ve got a recipe for a hit book. Of course, there are other things that matter, like the writing style and the actual story, but romance and mystery are a classic combo. 


I’ve got shelves full of romance thrillers, and there are some that I will go back to time and time again. With that in mind, here are 10 of my favorites that had me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing from sta…]]></summary>

As expected, Nintendo did mention the upcoming Switch successor as part of its latest financial release, but reiterated that its plans around the eventual announcement have not changed.
As covered by Reuters, president Shuntaro Furukawa stated during an online press conference that there will be no change to Nintendo's current plan to announce the 'Switch 2' by the end of the financial year (March 2025). In other words, then, if you thought the Switch's diminishing sales would spur the company on to reveal its successor, then you might want to temper your expectations.

Nintendo has released its latest financial data covering the first six-month period for FY2025 and, as part of that, it has updated the top ten best-selling games list once more.
The only major change we can see with this one is that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has usurped Super Mario Party to claim the eighth position. We'd also predicted a similar shift with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and Pokémon Sword and Shield, but alas, it seems as though both Pokémon generations are selling at a fairly similar rate at the moment (with Scarlet and Violet enjoying slightly higher sales), leading to a bit of a stalemate.

Nintendo has released its financial data for the six-month period of FY2025 Q1/Q2 and, as per the norm, has reconfirmed its upcoming line-up of software for the Nintendo Switch.
Truth be told, it's not a bad list of titles considering the console's age. If Nintendo had shown us this a couple of years back, we'd collectively nod our heads in appreciation. Still, there's no doubt in our minds that the recent reveal of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition has bolstered what would have otherwise been a fairly slim line-up.

Nintendo has released its six-month financial data for FY2025 Q1/Q2, revealing that the Switch family of systems has now topped a whopping 146.04 million units. The downside of this is that the console's momentum has undoubtedly slowed down, selling just 2.64 million more than the 143.42 reported in August this year (which, to be fair, is still pretty decent for a console of its age).
The decrease year-on-year is a rather startling 31%. As such, Nintendo has revised its hardware forecast for the remainder of the financial year, decreasing previous estimates by 1 million to land at 12.5 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, some vampire killers.
Ode to Castlevania is a full-circle moment for Vampire Survivors. Heavily inspired by the franchise, and originally built with assets influenced by Konami’s whip-cracking series, Luca Galante and Poncle have blown all of their other excellent DLC out of the water. If your jaw isn’t on the floor by the time you roll credits, we’ll get back in our coffin.
This is Vampire Survivors' second collaboration with Konami following the Contra-themed Operation Guns DLC. This time it's the same great, roguelike, auto-shooting, time-sucking Vampire Survivors gameplay, but now with a distinct twist to delight Castlevania fans. And while those fans will get the most out of the DLC, it doesn't really matter whether you've played a Castlevania game before — this DLC is a must-play, in our book.

Only with such a fantastic accessory atop our dome can we properly celebrate this one, because it has somehow been a whopping 20 years since The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap launched in Japan. While we search through our copious hatboxes to try and find such a headpiece, let's lay down the facts.

Back in April, the Nintendo Network servers were officially closed down, wrapping up online play for Wii U and 3DS users and the consoles' respective eShops. A few weeks after the closing date, we posted about four players who were still keeping the dream alive, remaining on the servers thanks to their constant, uninterrupted use of them.
These numbers would dwindle over the ensuing months, with the Wii U's online camp emptying completely in July. Just one brave player, @fishguy6564, remained on the 3DS, stuck in an endless loop of Mario Kart 7 online victory laps with nobody to play against. Today, almost seven months exactly since the Nintendo Network shut up shop, fishguy6564 has dropped out of the race (thanks for the heads up, Gaming Reinvented).

With the upcoming Switch launch of Metal Slug Tactics on 5th November 2024, we've caught up with developer Leikir Studio and creative director Aurélien Loos to take a dive into the game's visual design, focusing on the team's efforts to adapt iconic characters, vehicles, and environments into a new isometric view-point, while working to capture the franchise's iconic run 'n' gun essence.
To start, Loos wanted to make it clear that athough there are certainly some roguelike elements in Metal Slug Tactics, all of the environmental assets were handcrafted. To give a sense of the scale of the project, Loos states "In all, we have 181,511 in-game sprites and 217,701 lines of code, including 158,337 for gameplay only". It sounds like a mammoth task, then, and it looks like all that work has paid off in terms of the exquisite visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snip, snip.
Video game preservation still has a long way to go, but it’s difficult to imagine a re-release of Human Entertainment’s Clock Tower ten, or even five years ago. Yet thanks to rapidly growing interest in retro gaming and the resulting explosion of compilations and re-releases over the last few years, this curious SNES survival horror is now available worldwide in all its glory.
Originally exclusive to Japan, Clock Tower: Rewind presents the original 1995 game along with an enhanced version of the 1997 ‘First Fear’ PS1 port, adding in new scenarios and minor improvements such as the ability to run upstairs (both versions also include a rewind feature). On top of that, you’ve got a bunch of extras to peruse, including interviews with creator Hifumi Kono, motion comics, scans of the Japanese manual and strategy guide, and more. It’s a generous package that goes a long way to compensating for the game’s relatively short two-to-three-hour runtime (multiple endings included).

For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch have introduced a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."

Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.

Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It's not as bad as it sounds.

Ah, a minigolf game! I think I can just about hack the concept of minigolf, on this most desperate of Mondays. It is golf but mini. Bonzai golf. Digestible! Intuitive! Why, I've managed to write 100 words without even looking at the Steam page. Let's do so now. Wait a minute, this isn't minigolf. It's Mini Mini Golf Golf. What is Mini Mini Golf Golf? "Destabilize the present and plunge into a neon psychohistory of a bizarre entity in distress," the Steam page explains. "This is not a game about minigolf." It is too late to flee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited for Slitterhead, an action adventure game by Bokeh Studio, a studio founded by none other than your boy Keiichiro Toyama: the creator of Silent Hill, Gravity Rush, and the Siren series. And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, "Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!"
No, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.

Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there's a good reason for those misgivings. It's all about frames, you see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your hand up if you'd forgotten that every Assassin's Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Deck is something of a talisman for gaming on Linux, its popularity and penguin-powered SteamOS having almost singlehandedly dragged it past MacOS as the second-most-used operating system among Steam users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.

That's interesting for looking at the new 5th Gen AMD EPYC top-end wares but in comparing to 4th Gen EPYC also means higher core counts at the top-end. In being curious about the core-for-core advantages of 5th Gen EPYC, I managed to get my hands on the AMD EPYC 9655 processors for seeing how that model compares to the prior AMD EPYC 9654 "Genoa" flagship model.

This one is called Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux and it has labyrinths. Except the labyrinths don't just have single paths to their centres, but tube monsters covered in eyes who'll stalk you slowly and methodically as you meander.

Between January 2023 and February 2024, the men allegedly transcribed details of the Toho movie Godzilla Minus One and Kadokawa's Overlord III, before posting articles to a website as part of a conspiracy to unfairly generate advertising revenue.

I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’.

Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form Weird West studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for PC Gamer about Arkane’s closure, saying:
I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.

I never finished it because my Xbox 360 version was not, in practice, an open world game, but a lonely farm at the bottom of a vortex of butchered spacetime. In the prologue, reformed outlaw John Marston confronts an old bandit acquaintance and gets himself roundly shot to bits. He’s rescued by local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane, who nurses him back to health and gives him a few odd jobs to warm him up for the next plot point.

They teach us to see 1-1 divine intervention in every random house fire and every lightning bolt that miraculously strikes our enemies. By contrast, the forthcoming Zero Orders Tactics teaches that god prefers to operate via covert means, because after all, personally lobbing some electricity at somebody would be inelegant. It's far more graceful to trap them behind a mountain, instead.

"Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: "Nazis? I hate these guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.
I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.

To be honest with you, it looks more inspired by Rainbow Six Siege with what looks to be one team aiming to hack a crypt by breaking down defences, while the other reinforces structures to prevent them from doing that. There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting! If a difficult sell, given the fact it's yet another 5vs5 shooter…

The coalition argues that anti-piracy initiatives, including those in France and Italy, disrupt international trade, increase costs for U.S. companies, and could lead to unintended censorship.

I've already written our review for Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, in which I celebrated the touching moments of Max's return to the series, and lamented the clunky plot that she finds herself in. In this adventure game, you're looking into the killing of a close friend, shot by an unknown assailant. You hop between two dimensions to solve the case - one world in which your pal still lives and the other in which she's dead. Unfortunately for the murder victim, you play a bona fide hot mess who could not perform a cross examination if she were standing in front of a crucifix with a magnifying glass.

That’s also my experience with Beautiful Desolation - an isometric RPG I got a real kick out of the art for before also stopping one day and just accidentally never playing it again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into "Adventure Points", used to "unlock" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets. Sometimes, Indy's magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game's religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia. Sometimes, they exhaust you: please, Dr Jones, for the love of George. Stop trying to pick things up. Let me look at "ancient history" for a while.

Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025. To celebrate, they've also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

Yesterday they released a devlog in which game director Joe Ziegler seemed to want to reassure fans of the studio that the game was still in development. He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.

It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.

I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s one thing I’d like to get across about my time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard - perhaps a surprise given Bioware’s recent history, Anthem, and some of the early marketing for this game - it’s that in my 50 hour return to Thedas, I very rarely felt I was playing something cynical.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've often thought lighthouse keeping would make a fine second career, albeit mostly because in my head, it would give me endless time to write (and finish Baldur's Gate 3). You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

Pah. A skill issue if I ever saw one, honestly. Decade is a fascinating adventure game that drew me in with its apparent vagueness but then, like some sort of considerate, sensible coward, went on to explain itself well in on its Steam page.
It’s the end of the world, and you’re not too happy about it, so you’ll be shoving children in a time machine with little more than a rotting Lunchly and some instructions to help you figure out exactly what went wrong.

Representatives from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the AACS were in opposition, with ESA legal representative Steve Englund at one point fretting about some sort of hellish "online arcade that (he’d) been warning about for the last several proceedings".
Last Friday, as per a statement released by the VGHF and spotted by PC Gamer, the US Copyright Office officially denied the exemption.

Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".
When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rock Paper Shotgun has a fuzzy conception of "news", in that we regard the "new" element of news as overrated, more of a guideline than an obligation. The trick to selling this mindset is to overclock your obnoxious narcissism until it levels up into stylish solipsism. "It's news to me," I sternly insist, while announcing a game you might pedantically observe was announced in 2019. "I can obtain no reliable empirical evidence that this existed prior to my noticing it," I declare, writing about my discovery that Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 requires a permanent internet connection, even when you're playing the campaign.

Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget horror. I have been pigeonholed.

Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.
So, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn't only a product of its time - it's actually downright yucky.

If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

In parallel, legal streaming platforms are enjoying huge growth as business booms.

This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

It's a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here's the trailer.

I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm?

Developed by two-person queer married team resnijars, it looks like a real charmer. All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs. It's also out now, which is good for people like me who crave bizzarovanias.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to pick out the highlights from the Steam Deck’s latest SteamOS update, 3.6.19, just because its collection of tweaks and fixes seems to span the entire gamut of handheld PC hardware as a concept. Graphics driver improvements! Third-party SSDs working better! More balanced display colours! No more "spurious power LED blinking"! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the Steam Deck OLED’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be fair, there are several, far more substantial additions teased in Total War: Warhammer 3 design director Mitchell Heastie’s latest blog on the strategy game’s upcoming Patch 5.3. There’s also some interesting insight regarding design decisions, and the systems CA are hoping to tweak in the future. We’ll talk about that in a moment, but first, I must draw your attention to this magical map. I’m very excited about it. Not so much for what it does on its own - more for what its design philosophy represents and could mean for future additions.

Reason number two is that it's coming from the developers of the explosively moreish Bore Blasters. Find a teaser trailer below.

Alas, SI say they've looked into it, and it just isn't possible.

The music companies argue that ISPs can be held vicariously liable for pirating subscribers, even when they don't directly profit from this activity. Cox argues that this "radical new theory" would make ISPs liable for virtually anything their users do online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Není to kvalitní film, ale je šílený a není nudný ani rutinní. Je to výpověď o tom, co si Coppola na stará kolena myslí o světě a o filmařině - a taková výpověď mě zajímá. Ale kdyby to přesně stejně natočil 25letý absolvent filmové akademie, měl bych z toho jen legraci a vysmíval bych se jeho neschopnosti. (Ilča 60%)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kdybych teoreticky měl pěti- až osmileté dítě, hrozně bych chtěl, aby se mu tenhle film líbil. Kdyby mu bylo 10 nebo 12 let, už bych mu nepouštěl tohle, ale první Bayovy Transformers. Je to fajn, ale je to opravdu jen a pouze pro děti. A navíc, viděl jsem dabovanou verzi a rozhodně byla méně zábavná než tři minuty ukázek v původním znění, které jsem viděl taky. (Ilča 60 %)]]></summary>
