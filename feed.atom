        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second part of Dune is out at the moment, and it has resulted in that most filthy of perversions, discourse - a pastime in which only the most unsavoury characters indulge. Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going "Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute."
"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis," reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.

        <updated>2024-03-08T15:26:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since releasing to early access over ten years ago, Rust has become one of the most famous online survival games in the current era. I say "famous" when I really mean "infamous" because, as anyone who's played the game knows, it's hard as frick. What we really need is a tutorial.


Ta-da! As of now, the latest patch for Rust has started rolling out which, low and behold, implements a Tutorial Island, perfect for getting to grips with the fundamentals. According to a post over on Steam, the island offers a way of adding a "safe environment to learn the basic controls and mechanics of Rust before being set loose in the main game with other players."




It also says that all players will be prompted to run through the tutorial "when they first spawn this month," but you can decline the offer. Here's what you'll learn:



Basic movement


Crafting


Building bases


Upgrading bases


Respawning


Basic combat


Resources


Looting containers


Cooking


Using Furnaces


Workbenches


Using a vehicle



No mention of how to cope with being screamed at by aggressive teens


That's probably one of the biggest things to come out of this update. But there's also another huge improvement that's been made to Rust in the guise of better night lighting.


The update notes go on to say that to combat "gamma hacking" from players, the studio has added a "Nightlight feature." Essentially, this is a shader that illuminates the immediate area in front of you at nighttime, "mimicking the effect of natural moon light."


In short: you should now be able to see much better in the dark. It's still going to be pretty dark, though, so don't expect to be able to confidently run through the inky blackness with nary a care in the world. This is Rust, after all.

More specifically, the ongoing push and pull between Super Earth and the opposing factions has now focused on the planet of Tien Kwan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've kind of become used to the idea of monthly subscriptions for our gaming needs. But if even that's too much for you, Nvidia has now made it possible to utilize its cloud gaming service on a daily basis.


As reported by Videocardz, you can now purchase a Day Pass for GeForce NOW, which gives you access to Nvidia's servers, powered by the RTX 4000-series graphics cards. It comes in two flavors as well: Priority and Ultimate, similar to the monthly memberships.




As for what you get, well, you'll be entitled to 24-hour access to Team Green's cloud, which includes all the usual benefits of a typical subscription, but without actually having to subscribe for a month or beyond.


But not 24-hour gaming


It should be said that you won't get to play your games through GeForce NOW for the full 24 hours. Depending on which tier you opt for, you'll get either six or eight hours of actual game time, but you'll have access to the servers for the entire day.


According to the sign-up page on Nvidia's website, you can pay $3.99 for the Priority Day Pass or $7.99 for Ultimate. The latter is said to have "exclusive access" to the RTX 4080 servers. You'll also benefit from up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS.


Oh, but if you want to try before you buy, the report from Videocardz says there's an option to get a free hour-long session, but I couldn't see where you would sign up for that. It also comes with ads, because we are, in actuality, living in an episode of Black Mirror (what a cool reference).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With reports that Embracer Group allegedly cancelled an upcoming Deus Ex game, hopes of a return to the series have been fading. The industry is in a sad state now, so if you want to cheer yourself up with a dose of Adam Jensen, you can pick up Mankind Divided for free next week.


That's one of the titles being given away over on Epic Games Store. The other is an indie puzzle from 2013 called The Bridge. Both will be available between March 14 and March 21. They will be replacing the sci-fi combat game Astro Duel 2.




While it may not be the most lauded Deus Ex entry out there, it's still a nice little freebie for those who have yet to play it.


You can't resist all that sincere moping


Things are so up in the air for Eidos-Montreal's celebrated series. With voice actor Elias Toufexis being told to stop talking so much about Adam Jensen, there's definitely a sense that we won't ever get to see a follow-up to Mankind Divided.


It's a story we're all getting sick of hearing, no doubt. The video game industry is in dire straits at the moment, as huge publishers issue redundancies and studio closures. Eidos was one of those recently, which effectively put a nail in the Deus Ex coffin. Honestly, it's hard to keep up with the amount of job losses that have occurred these past 12 months or so.


While we won't likely get to see a new Deus Ex entry, maybe take some comfort in being able to get a copy of the latest installment for free. Sorry, didn't mean to bring the mood down there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fancy a winch? Oh, you call it a shift? Same difference, baby.
When we first got wind that Expeditions: A MudRunner Game was on its way to Nintendo Switch, we gotta admit, we were a little bit surprised. This new entry in Saber Interactive's superb off-road sim series takes the whole mud-running malarkey to a new level, with larger maps, loads more fine details, and improved physics over its well-regarded predecessors. How on earth was this big, modern, physics-heavy driving game going to run in handheld mode on a seven-year-old console?
Well, as it turns out, not without some fairly notable issues. However, we will say straight off the bat that if this is your only way to play, or you're just a big fan of the previous games, you'll likely be able to overlook most of the roadblocks. But let's quickly run through the overall deal with what's different between this new entry and the sublime Snowrunner first.

EA has made these classics and more, and for some reason The Saboteur, available on Steam for the first time. You can see the full list of games here. I don't have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it's very funny that the list goes, like, "beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s". Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno has announced that the meat you can cook over campfires in Dragon's Dogma 2 is, in fact, "real meat". There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.

Or, if you're like me and cannot resist playing for hours in a character creator, you can enjoy fiddling with its many sliders and marvelling at the breadth of options like 334 different colours for its four eye colour settings and the ability to remove individual teeth. I made my kitten as my pal, because I guess that's what I do now.

Where to start The Winged Knight


First, to even meet Ochlys, you'll need to head to Treyes Village to start The Winged Knight side quest. You can take the path south from Thulust Harbor and head east at the fork, past Fort Mainteneaut, to find the battle.


After speaking with Ochlys, you'll need to help her reclaim Rondmort Church from some local bandits, whose forces you might remember. It's an Enemy Level 4 fight, which shouldn't be too tough.

Beginning back in 2015, io games made a huge debut and were some of the most popular titles on the market all the way through 2018, with even PewDiePie once declaring an io game to be his "new favorite game." Now that’s some popularity.


Nowadays, there are still loads of active io games for players to enjoy or just try out. There are way too many to list, but there are a few that are worth checking out. Here are the eight best io games you can play right now.

<p>No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of "the greatest of all time" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.</p>

Depending on perspective, that's either a threat or delight to muse over, especially when you consider Square Enix isn't too shy to flirt with the big screen  — looking at you, Spirits Within and Advent Children. 


For better or for worse, I often find myself musing over ideal actors for the inevitable, like Zelda or Shadow. So, in case Hollywood goes for it, I'm shouting out my choices now. In honor of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's launch, here are my picks for a live-action FF7 cast that I think, if made now, would be worthy of such a classic legacy.

Chiori uses the purple Ousia version of Artificed Spare Clockwork Components as her boss materials. The Icewind Suite duo can be found near the Opera Epiclese. Talk to Maillardet and be sure to choose the “Dirge of Coppelia” challenge each time you fight this boss.


You’ll need 46 Components in total, which will take an average of 18 boss runs or about 720 Resin at World Level 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the 'tank' enemies in Helldivers 2, only one is an actual freakin' tank. The Annihilator Tank is the Automaton answer to the age-old question of "Where did that hole in my chest come from?" Good thing it's not too tough to kill a Tank in Helldivers 2.


Granted, taking one out does require you to not be standing in front of it. Much like other vehicles (such as Helldiver 2's own Hulk) the Annihilator Tank comes with a weak point that's a video game classic. You need to find the big, glowing spot and shoot at it until the machine lies in pieces. That's easier said than done, usually, but with the right firepower and some quick footwork you too can beat the Tank.

        <updated>2024-03-07T20:04:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that they’re releasing a slew of their older games onto Steam. All of them were available elsewhere, but finally, they’re available on the PC’s biggest digital storefront.


A lot of these are from Bullfrog, one of the many studios that EA shuttered, but there’s also the Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection, which features some games from Westwood, another studio that EA shuttered.


Here’s the list:



Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection


SimCity 3000 Unlimited


Populous


Populous 2: Trials of the Olympic Gods


Populous: The Beginning


Dungeon Keeper Gold


Dungeon Keeper 2


Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack


The Saboteur



That’s a coincidence! I’ve been working on something involving Command & Conquer, and while doing my research, discovered The Ultimate Collection. I saw that it was available on the “EA App” (formerly Origin), and that’s as far as I went in that direction because I’m not installing the EA App. Now I don’t have to! Phew. But that’s neat since I just discovered its existence today while I was looking up if you could still buy Command & Conquer Renegade.


Aside from that, everything else was available on GOG, and I already own most of them on that list, but not Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection.


If it sounds like I’m being flippant, it’s because EA is one of the worst companies when it comes to preserving their back catalog. SimCity 3000 is here, but do you know what isn’t available? The original SimCity. Most of what they made back in the ‘80s and ‘90s might as well not exist to them.


But credit where it’s due. You can now buy the listed EA games on Steam. That’s not nothing. Maybe they're going to pay better respect to their old classics, but I'll believe it when I see it.


The games are available right now, and they're all discounted quite considerably for a limited time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV has a long list of recurring seasonal events that happen (mostly) around the same time every year. For 2024, two of these, Little Ladies’ Day and Hatching-tide, will combine into one celebration, beginning on March 14 and ending on April 1.


Usually, the bulk of Little Ladies’ Day occurs in March, while Hatching-tide celebrates in April. Rather than splitting them up this year, we’re getting one combined mega event adding differing decorations across Eorzea between its three city-states. The only bummer is we get only one (admittedly pretty fun) reward.

Generally, Baldur's Gate 3 is a challenge on whatever setting you pick, but Tactician is brutal. The setting forces players into a new mindset: Fully take advantage of all the systems BG3 offers, or die. Honestly, it's amazing how different the game feels with the difficulty spike, and I love it.

While it's still in early development, the initial trailer shows off a stunning world rendered with beautifully pixellated graphics and precision combat that looks both fast-paced and satisfying.


With a focus on a 3D perspective instead of the previous game's 2D approach, Abyss X Zero presents players with an expansive world to explore as two different characters, Codename A and Codename Z. Each has their own combat abilities impacting the flow of battle and how they'll interact with the environment. 


The twist is that these characters are fated to battle each other, meaning you're going to be repeatedly fighting against a very familiar foe.

The event starts March 12 and features skins, emotes, and more from the space bounty hunter anime. Music from the series will be featured in-game as well. The below trailer is all it took for me to click the Install button for Overwatch 2 on my Battle.net launcher for the first time in over a year.




I'll admit, I didn't see this coming. But I'm oh so glad it is. Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite animes ever. Well, the original, of course, not the live-action Netflix thing. And while I never really considered an Overwatch collab with the series, it's actually...quite perfect.


Here are all the confirmed Cowboy Bebop Legendary Skins coming to Overwatch 2 in the collab:



Spike Spiegel Cassidy


Faye Valentine Ashe


Jet Black Mauga


Ed Sombra


Ein Wreckingball



The Ein Wreckinball skin will be available to all players for free.


I didn't see myself reinstalling Overwatch 2, at least not any time soon. So great job Blizzard, you've achieved that. Now don't let me down, let's keep the cool stuff coming. After all, that's all I want with Overwatch 2, is to have a fun time!


The Overwatch 2 and Cowboy Bebop collab event goes live on March 12 on all platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanillaware's latest game Unicorn Overlord arrives tomorrow. The embargo is up, and by now, sites are already posting thoughts and takes on the latest from the studio behind Dragon's Crown, Odin Sphere, 13 Sentinels, and many other well-loved games.


And as I've written about previously, Unicorn Overlord takes an interesting approach. It's looking back on the strategy stylings of classics like Ogre Battle, utilizing real-time strategy and an overworld map, setting it apart from other recent throwback tactics projects. Units move and fight in automated conflict using logical progression that you've set up ahead of time, similar to the Gambit system from Final Fantasy XII.


In the 20 hours I've played of Unicorn Overlord thus far, I've been fairly enthralled. It's a breath of fresh air in …]]></summary>

As far as updates go, patch 1.0.2 isn’t particularly expansive. It primarily addresses some small bugs that have cropped up in various aspects of the game from quest interactions to UI details. It does make adjustments to two skills – the Warlock’s Ghost Flame and the Falconer’s Dive Bomb – but only because the abilities were causing performance issues in the game. Any serious balance changes will have to wait a while because, as Eleventh Hour says in the patch notes, “Our current stance is that we won’t issue mid-cycle changes for balance.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. 


The game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as "Beloved" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.

There's nothing more humiliating than trying to outmaneuver them only to get eliminated with a measly few pushes. Fortunately, the Season 2 Reloaded update introduced a new way to counter Riot Shields with the Soulrender melee weapon. 


Detonated first reported on this discovery, where they utilized the Soulrender to eliminate a Riot Shield wielder. In the clip, the melee weapon completely ignores the defensive device by shoving it out of the way. Of course, you can imagine what happens next, as the Operator takes down their enemy with Soulrender's swift movements.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/nvidia-amd-mid-range-gpus-could-well-reach-below-400/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=nvidia-amd-mid-range-gpus-could-well-reach-below-400"/>
        <updated>2024-03-07T16:34:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bout continues as Nvidia and AMD butt heads in the arena of "Graphics Card Supremacy" (it's painfully obvious I know nothing about boxing). I mean, they're both huge tech conglomerates, so it's not as if Dr. Lisa Su and Jensen Huang fight it out school playground-style. Still, we're seeing an ongoing battle as the price of mid-range GPUs takes a dive.


As reported by Tom's Hardware, a number of products from Team Red and Team Green are becoming cheaper, to the point of being quite affordable, finally. In particular, it's those middle-of-the-road cards that may be within reach for some of us, hopefully leaving the 'mid-range GPU the price of an enthusiast GPU' behind. 


For example: the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB from MSI is as low as $419 on Newegg. Though that's after a $20 rebate and using a promo code. Same with the AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT, which has been sighted as low as $409. Again, promo codes will help get you to the bottom end of the price.


How low can you go?


There's an argument to be had that these graphics cards – both of which are more mid-range – could stand to be a little cheaper. The 16GB variant of the RTX 4060 Ti was about $100 more expensive than its 8GB predecessor when it first launched. This is despite it being the exact same card, just with more VRAM.


A report from PC Gamer seems to agree that these models could fall below the $400 mark, which would probably make them more appealing.


Anyone who's tried to build a custom PC using modern hardware knows how expensive it is. Not everyone is rich enough to be lumped into the "enthusiast" category, so to see some fairly decent GPUs having their prices slashed feels like a step in the right direction.

The post Nvidia and AMD mid-range GPU prices keep tumbling, hopefully on the way to under $400 appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.
This first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its meteoric early success, it was only a matter of time before Helldivers 2 ran into its first non-technical speed bump. Being a live service game, Helldivers 2's health rests on the developer's handling of gear outliers, and the first balance patch is a hot topic with the community.


Broadly, there are two aspects of Helldivers 2's first major balancing update that the community has taken issue with. The first is the fact that Arrowhead Studios has neutered the game's meta loadout in one fell swoop, and the second is that the long-anticipated armor fix is proving problematic, with players even more susceptible to damage than ever before. The community sentiment is currently fairly low, then, and it doesn't help that some of the developers and adjacent employees from Arrowhead …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 got its anticipated balance patch this week — to mixed results. A number of players in the game's community are unhappy with alterations made to a few weapons. In particular, some Helldivers 2 players are expressing concern over changes to the Railgun and how effective it now is against one irritating insect. 


Pre-update, the Railgun shined in the face of the infamously bullish bug, the Charger. Two shots to the leg and fire from a primary weapon were all it took to take out the unruly beast. The Railgun can still ground a Charger the same way, but the recent changes make it so it can only shred enemy armor in Unsafe mode. That isn't a problem, really, when you're facing a single Charger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason, the Fallout Teaser Trailer that dropped a few months ago just didn't really resonate with me. The strong points of the IP, its post-apocalyptic world and intriguing "wild west" style narrative were missing from the mainly b-roll teaser. However, Amazon just released a new over 3-minute long trailer for the show and it looks a lot more like the Fallout I know.




Everything that felt missing from the teaser is actually front and center in this new trailer. We start with a look at life inside the vault, which looks half comfy and half dystopia. You know, your typical Fallout vault. We also get a look at some of the characters. First is Ella Purnell who plays Jean, a vault dweller who leaves the safety of the vault for the first time. In the trailer, her character appears cautiously optimistic about life on the surface, which is more or less how I felt leaving the vault for the first time in Fallout 3, though it didn't last long.


Then there's Walton Goggins who plays the Ghoul. The trailer actually starts by showing him before the nuclear war, as a vault salesman which fits. Then as a Ghoul, he appears to be the sarcastic carefree selfish character we'd expect from a Ghoul.


We also get a look at plenty of subtle yet "Fallout-esque" features throughout. Like a medical robot assuring Jean, "I'm simply going to harvest your organs!" Yep, it's Fallout.


Of course, I'll save my full judgment for when the series actually drops. But I can say I'm more optimistic that this will be a genuine Fallout story rather than the IP serving only as a name to the story like the recent Halo series.


All episodes of Fallout will become available for streaming on April 11, which is right around the corner!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eggnut, the developer behind the Tails Noir games (formerly titled Backbone) has announced that the studio is ceasing operation.


In a statement posted to Twitter, the studio says, “Starting today, Eggnut is halting its operations. This shit sucks.”




The statement goes on to say that the reason behind this decision was complications in securing funding for the development of their next game, which they have been working on for two years. Their remaining budget will go towards assisting the studio’s 15 employees “to regroup, find new jobs, and hopefully continue creating.” They will, however, continue to support the two games in the Tails Noir series.


I reviewed both Backbone and Tails: The Backbone Preludes back when they were released. I remember seeing the change in nomenclature, but I don’t remember finding why. I thought they were decent games. I felt like they got a lot right, but didn’t quite stick the landing, but I was always looking forward to seeing more. It’s unfortunate that the studio won’t be able to return to it.


Eggnut closes the statement by saying, “We’ve been at it since 2017, and it was great to have you by our side. The world is on fire. The game industry is fucked. Call your mom.” I feel that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My kingdom for a unicorn.
How do you follow up a game like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim? Before that ambitious, phenomenal sci-fi adventure, developer Vanillaware found its niche in creating rich, beautiful-looking worlds with a magical, medieval twist. Sometimes it was traditional Western fantasy, while others it jumped back to Edo Japan. Unicorn Overlord marks the developer’s return to the former, taking place in a fantasy realm overtaken by an evil lord. That sounds like the exact opposite of 13 Sentinels’ winding plot, but Unicorn Overlord is ambitious in an entirely different way. It’s also absolutely brilliant, effortlessly blending multiple systems to create a wonderful tactical RPG with a twist.
At the start of the game, you witness the fall of the Kingdom of Cornia thanks to a revolt led by General Valmore. At the same time, the young prince Alain flees the kingdom with the Holy Knight Josef, to ensure the bloodline survives. The revolt, however, is successful, and the Zenioran Army rises up and gradually overtakes all five nations of Valmore. Ten years later, Alain returns to build a liberation army to take back his kingdom and restore order to the continent of Fevrith.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.
It was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that interest in Starfield has been waning, with an unfortunate decline in people playing Bethesda's new IP. Still, the developer is determined to keep the metaphorical motor running, and the latest update for the game is now out in Steam Beta.


One thing to note about the patch notes is the sheer number of "fixes" that have been implemented. In fact, in a recent post on The-X-Formerly-Known-As-Twitter, version 1.10.30 of Starfield has over 400 things that have been fixed. Bethesda games, amirite? Also, just to reiterate: this is just for Steam Beta. The final patch will be rolling out for PC and Xbox sometime after.




Some other things that have been added in the new update: new camera mode expressions, support for changing FOV in "3rd Person Ship view," autosave when fast traveling back into orbit, and some general quality-of-life improvements.


What about some new content?


Hundreds of fixes are obviously a good thing, but a lot of people will be more interested in some new content for the game. We've recently gotten wind that the Shattered Space DLC could be arriving soon. That might see an uptick in general interest.


We all know the story. It hasn't been the best trajectory for Starfield. At the time of writing, there are just over 4,000 people playing on PC, according to SteamDB. For comparison, over 15,000 people are in Skyrim: Special Edition. That's not a great look, to be honest.


Look, pretty much all games have their slumps. They release, get a lot of attention, then take a bit of a dive. T'is the way. But for what was easily the most hyped game of this generation, Starfield sure has taken quite the nosedive.

This week's Japanese charts are now in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and it is no surprise that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's debut has shaken things up a little.
Square Enix's latest take on the iconic RPG has stormed to the top of the charts in its first week, with a whopping 262,252 units sold. The rest of the chart is dominated by Switch software, but nothing comes close to this front-runner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weappy Wholesome (!?) is showing off its upcoming movie-making sim, Hollywood Animal, with a deep dive into its gameplay systems. Oh my gosh…


The trailer, entitled “How To Make a Quick Buck With a Shameless Sequel,” is framed like it’s just going to show you how to make a sequel. It starts out simply representing the vapid nature of constant, creatively devoid sequels that are the foundation of the movie industry. Then, the seven-minute clip just gets darker and darker.




The slide begins with the demonstration of having a writer add “torture in captivity” as a plot device. Before you know it, the narrator is talking you through kidnapping a movie star and forcing them to play a role in the movie. Then the director has his third heart attack. In order to allow the movie to stand out at release, the narrator suggests bribing the police to raid rival studios in an effort to delay their projects.


Then, when you think it can’t get any more unscrupulous, the trailer walks you through calling in a favor from the Ku Klux Klan to have them promote the film within their ranks. To top it all off, the narrator then insults the audience, insinuating that they’re just a bunch of sheep.


Well then.


Hollywood Animal is one of my most anticipated games this year. I’m somewhat worried if the execution will live up to the promise, but if the trailer is anything to go by, it just might. Really, just watching the trailer, I see a lot of math going on in the back end. Math is a scary thing.


Weappy Wholesome was hoping to have a demo together for the recent Steam Next Fest, but decided to hold off. As they say, you “only get one chance to make a first impression,” which I agree with.


Hollywood Animal is slated to launch on PC later this year.

      <p>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Frostpunk 2, including a release date.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/08/12/frostpunk-2-is-coming-and-it-takes-place-decades-after-the-original">First announced</a> in 2021, 11 Bit Studios’ tense city-management sim arrives on July 25, and it’s also coming to PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>A new trailer shows off some of the game’s bleak, choice-driven gameplay. You’re charged with leading a city set within an inhospitable frozen wasteland, making decisions about how it’s governed to keep mouths fed and, hopefully, happy. That includes managing labor, politics, and even the food supply, which can ingratiate you to citizens or, worst case, cause them to revolt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 will first launch on PC but will come to consoles at a later date (including Xbox Game Pass).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, everybody. Want to kill all humans?
There is no shortage of terrible things buried deep underground, but, in Ancient Weapon Holly, you get to be the worst of them. This roguelike from Acquire, one of the studios behind the Octopath Traveler series, puts you in control of a powerful robot that seeks revenge on the humans that buried it for thousands of years. Reaching the surface and killing all humans will take a bit longer than you’d expect, though.
At first glance, Ancient Weapon Holly is a serviceable, fun, action-packed roguelite. The game consists of ten levels to play through, each one increasing in difficulty. Holly starts with a basic ranged attack and the ability to open up pits in the floor for enemies to fall into. These can be closed up to instantly kill most enemies, particularly once you’ve upgraded your attack power through the game’s version of a sphere grid. It is an interesting mechanic and the combat is chaotic enough to keep you interested for a few hours, but the game’s lack of depth makes it feel repetitive long before Holly reaches the surface.

But their latest venture - created in partnership with developers Chibig and Inverge Studios, and co-written by Rhianna Pratchett - is drastically different. Titled Creatures Of Ava, it's a fantasy game about saving Pokémon-like creatures, as opposed to, well, imprisoning them and using them for labour (Palworld, I'm looking at you).

      <p>About eight months ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PekONLKFGU">Capcom and Microsoft revealed Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> in somewhat vague terms. It is an action game based in and inspired by historical Japan, but that was about all we knew. Today, Capcom showed a lot more gameplay and offered some additional insight into the single player game. Plus it detailed more of exactly what the game is on its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/03/06/xbox-partner-preview-path-of-the-goddess/">Xbox Wire page</a>.</p>

<p>The action is defined as "dancing swords," but you will also be making decisions about what villagers you will take with you on your journey, leading to some strategic elements. You will apparently be making preparations for battle during the day to protect your Maiden and the village before the night, which is when battle takes place.</p>

<p>Capcom and Microsoft do not have a release date for the game yet, but it is apparently coming this year and will be included with Game Pass subscriptions.</p>]]></summary>

The new and extremely damp survival horror game, set in a heavily flooded New England city in the 1920s, is pivoting the studio to a "'horror-first' focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration and its Lovecraftian setting and story". This is a step away from the studio's mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let's peer through the weeds a bit further.

      <p>The Alters is a fascinating new sci-fi survival game from 11 Bit Studios, makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/04/11-bit-studios-unveils-first-gameplay-for-new-sci-fi-adventure-the-alters">First revealed</a> last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by "himself," I mean multiple versions of himself.</p>

<p>Jan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the "what if" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today's Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it's coming to Game Pass for console and PC.</p>]]></summary>

Nintendo's latest collaboration with Lego has resulted in a handful of Animal Crossing sets, a crossover that fans have been begging for ever since the firms' first collaboration, the LEGO Super Mario sets, were announced back in March 2020 — coincidentally Animal Crossing: New Horizons' launch month.
In the years since, we've seen a bunch of Nintendo-themed Lego sets encompassing the more play-focused Super Mario series to the grander, more expensive sets like the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Mario 64 '?' Block, and the mighty Bowser, which are aimed at older gamers.

I was one of the folks who wasn't so hot on what we'd played, and I'd hoped that the early access version would prove me wrong.
Alas, I am sad to report that I still do not like Nightingale. From what I've played so far, the game is an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind, which makes you feel divorced from the very world you inhabit.

The patch nerfs three of what were hitherto the best Helldivers 2 guns and gear pieces - the SG-225 Breaker shotgun, the RS-422 railgun, and the SH-32 shield generator backpack, all of which break Arrowhead's pretty straightforward golden rule that "each gun has its purpose and none is strictly better than another".

Every now and then you get an indie developer who you can rely on to deliver a banger pretty much every time. New Star Games is one such developer, having already scored healthy scores on Nintendo Life in the past for New Star Manager (which scored 8), Retro Bowl (9), and Retro Goal (8).
Alongside its Switch releases, it’s also been responsible for a bunch of fantastic mobile games, including the likes of the New Star Soccer series, New Star Cricket, and New Star Baseball. Essentially, everything New Star touches turns to gold, but it’s also fair to say it has a style of game it’s best known for: retro-style sports games.

You might remember this vocation from the original Dragon's Dogma; then as now, it combines relatively straightforward bow combat with various breeds of enchanted ammunition, for a surprisingly technical skillset that is enjoyable to faff around with.

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I sat down to play three hours of Dragon's Dogma 2 at a Capcom event last month, I gave myself two broad objectives. The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. 


In Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled "pawn" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.

      <p>In 1987, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird developed a storyline for their creation that never came to fruition. Titled "The Last Ronin," Eastman and Laird envisioned it as the final Turtles story set 30 years in the future. While Eastman and Laird never got around to creating that storyline in the original run of their comics under their company Mirage Studios, the idea stuck with Eastman through the years, and decades later, as part of the franchise's new life with IDW P…]]></summary>

And now footage has emerged of the cancelled project, which certainly does look like a team shooter reminiscent of Epic's epic.

My only beef is that credits rolled before I was properly given a chance to test my newfound robo-bashing muscles.

If you like ravaged Gothic masonry and dramatic evening skies, you might like Voin. If you dislike fighting fireball-lobbing demons with a sword, you might not like Voin. If you like open-ended, changeable levels full of loot and secrets, you might like Voin. If you are confused about whether you'll like or dislike Voin, you might want to try it for yourself during the first public Steam playtest on Friday, March 8th.

Having spent all of 30 minutes with an early playtest build, I'm cautiously impressed. I suspect there are cooler, less-known inspirations at work, but this feels like a Demon's Souls-ified Doom Eternal that doesn't quite have Doom Eternal's swagger and precision, probably because it is the work of just one developer, Nikita Sozidar, rather than hundreds.

      <p>Moomin, the popular Finish comic character from the 1940s, is getting a video game in 2024 – and we're ready for it. You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/11/03/december-cover-revealed-quantum-break.aspx">Quantum Break cover story</a>. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.</p>

<p>I had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.</p>

<p>Check out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.


Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.

Two universal conveniences: your shopping basket is now shared across devices, so no losing track of things you meant to buy later; and buying gift copies is now less faffy. More conditional: you can now choose to make individual games private, meaning no one will ever see if you own them or are playing them. I won't ask why you might want to hide any particular games.

The tease accompanies news that Crema are making significant changes to Temtem as part of the game's update 1.7 - for one thing, they're getting rid of the whole microtransaction system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.
He's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.

      <p>Digital Sun, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/moonlighter/b/playstation4/archive/2018/05/31/moonlighter-review-gameinformer.aspx">Moonlighter</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/03/07/the-mageseeker-a-league-of-legends-story-gets-april-release-date">The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story</a>, has announced its city-building RTS, Cataclismo, is coming in July.</p>

<p>Cataclismo was first revealed last year and was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9VsbTVsn1A" width="640"></iframe>

<p>The game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

In the middle of the white space there is a curious little yellow machine, a kind of motorised plunger akin to an oil derrick. In the story of Sixty Four, you're late to some kind of social engagement, somewhere beyond that beaming expanse of whiteness. But there is time, even as texts from a friend appear down the lefthand margin, to mess around with the strange yellow machine.

This weekend saw the release of the Crystal Creations Stuff Pack, a DLC for The Sims 4 that takes the ability to find crystals (already in the game) and straps on your Sims making them into semi-precious, semi-magic jewellery that can be charged up by the moon. What I find more interesting is that this launched with some official IRL Sims plumbob jewellery that you can buy and wear around your own precious, swan-like neck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. 


Players must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.

Where some see an overpriced, memory-deprived albatross of a graphics card, I’ve only ever seen a fast and feature-rich GPU whose 12GB of VRAM is demonstrably fine for 99.95% of games at 4K. A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.
Now, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.

The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. 


Or at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described "professional fraudster" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.

      <p>Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.</p>

<p>No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be <em>Game Informer</em>’s latest <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/02/26/cover-reveal-no-rest-for-the-wicked">cover story.</a></p>

<p>Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.</p>]]></summary>

      <p>While the easy layup might have been a third game in the amazing Ori series, developer Moon Studios' next game after 2020's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-even-better-than-the">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a> is an isometric action-RPG called <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/ori-team-moon-studios-reveals-action-rpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest For The Wicked</a>. It's the game adorning our upcoming issue of&nbsp;<em>Game Informer</em>, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game's opening hour or so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game's first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon's pivot to this new genre.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Moon Studios cemented itself as a premier upstart studio thanks to its stellar work on Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The team is parlaying that success and experience to craft a dramatically different project it's been dreaming about for years: No Rest for the Wicked. This dark fantasy action RPG combines influences from a variety of genres, from ARPGs like Diablo to the difficulty and thoughtful combat of Dark Souls, to the town-building of Animal Crossing, and more.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Ori And The Blind Forest developers Moon Studios announced that their next game would be a top-down, online action RPG, my initial reaction was, 'Heck yes, sign me the hell up for this Souls-y, Diablo-y hack and slash.' Having now played the opening 90 minutes of the game ahead of tonight's Wicked Inside showcase, that initial excitement has settled into more of a 'Hoo boy, this thing is hard as nails. Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.' It's definitely verging on the edge of being just a teensy bit too punishing for my personal taste, but even though my arse got thoroughly whomped time and time again during this initial prologue section, there's still something about No Rest For The Wicked that's left me quietly captivated.

Each page listed Arrowhead as the developer, and PlayStation as the publisher, along with big discounts of 50-75% off to tempt players into buying the cheap version instead of the real one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.
It’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.

Still, the new independent Toys For Bob say they're working on something new and "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft.

The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen's to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have noticed that SSDs got extremely cheap towards the end of 2023, and then they rebounded somewhat in 2024. We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren't likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they're still well worth covering. 
The subject of today's deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As with all headlines that are phrased as a question, the answer is "probably not", but in any case, Miyazaki has mysteriously hinted at there being at least one secret thing in Elden Ring that players haven't found yet. On this week's Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss this, as well as some of our favourite and least favourite deployments of the video game Easter egg. We also talk about what we've been playing this week (Nightingale; PowerWash Sim, natch) and visiting Scotland. Sadly neither of us got to go to the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience. But we both wish we could have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocket Rat Games co-founder John Guerra remembers the exact day he started working on Cobalt Core's first prototype. He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. "I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core," he tells me.
The pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, "we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall," he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had "a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but "Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre," says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, "you can kind of see how that went from A to B".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Shakespeare's Anthony And Cleopatra, said famous woman says "Give to a gracious message an host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt." I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.
This is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the "you're about to be unemployed" language right there. The company is moving away from "the development of future licensed IP" and toward "our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities". Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer's count) must go.

Use the plane's sea anchor as a rudimentary fishing claw. Need to open a box you found on the beach? The plane's the thing, etcetera.

It could cover the entire scene with banana peels, however.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

Below is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug 
reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by reporting a bug. You can also vote for an existing issue to indicate that it also affects
